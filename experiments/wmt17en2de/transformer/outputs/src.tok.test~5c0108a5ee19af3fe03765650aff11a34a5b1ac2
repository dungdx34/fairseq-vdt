Jennifer Aniston : I 'm always pigeonholed
Jennifer Aniston need not always be perfect or successful .
that is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly clear in an interview .
" I 'm always pigeonholed , or labelled by someone who has little , if anything , to do with me and reality . "
" personally , I have no desire to be perfect and successful all the time . "
" to be honest , I don ' t really give a damn about things like that . "
Jennifer Aniston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she has been dubbed " Miss Perfect " in the current issue of " Cosmopolitan . "
the actress prefers to spend her time at home in front of the television with her hair in a relaxed bun , eating Mexican food , the magazine reports .
the question of whether she wants children makes her livid : " we women do not need to be married or have children to feel fulfilled , " the Hollywood star says .
in her new film , " Mother 's Day - love isn ' t child 's play , " Aniston stars as a single mother with two sons .
the film is released in Germany on 25 August .
golfer Langer is awarded the Sport Pyramid
his experience on horseback is negligible .
at the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Langer and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a bit of fun .
it was a first for the 58 @ - @ year @ - @ old .
Chio : " golden Sport Pyramid " for Bernhard Langer
after a few minutes , the horse decided it wanted to go home , and raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt .
after a kilometre at this speed I was scared .
" it wasn ' t a good experience , " said Langer .
and with that , his riding career came to an end again .
on Saturday , Germany 's best golfer of all time - with 101 tournament wins under his belt - was once again near horses .
he and his family toured the ALRV grounds , but he did not jump onto a horse for a photo .
it was Langer 's first time in Aachen , and at CHIO .
he had been thoroughly convinced .
the German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event .
the friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards .
the Federal Cross of Merit , the Silver Laurel Leaf , Champions Tour Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has bestowed an honour upon him .
Langer is the 18th person to be awarded the Sport Pyramid .
on Saturday , he met the first person to receive it , Hans Günter Winkler , in Aachen .
" this award means a lot to me , " said Langer , " because it 's not just given for sporting success , but also for social commitment . "
Langer has been encouraging up @ - @ and @ - @ coming talent for years .
and in this vein , he passed the prize money of 25,000 euros on straight away .
the two @ - @ time US master 's champion was inaugurated into the " Hall of Fame for German Sport " on Saturday , along with 15 other outstanding sportspeople .
those given the award include track athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt , gymnast Eberhard Gienger , fencers Cornelia Hanisch , Alexander Putsch and Arnd Schmitt , rower Peter @ - @ Michael Kolbe , bob @ - @ sleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer , judo player Frank Wieneke , show @ - @ jumper Alwin Schockemöhle , and , posthumously , handball player Erhard Wunderlich .
many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustrious gathering wandered to the show @ - @ jumping stadium , where the Lavazza Prize was underway .
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the large animals .
comparing Clinton 's and Trump 's economic policies : it 's all about the money
both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement .
but the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies , as well as on one fundamental issue .
there is a fundamental philosophical reason for the differences between Donald Trump 's and Hillary Clinton 's economic policies .
this is the role of the state .
if in doubt , Trump wants the state 's role to be minor , and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to lead the economy to its death and regulate it to its death , he says .
he would do things totally differently , Trump says .
he would repeal regulations , and lead a wide @ - @ reaching tax reform with low rates for private individuals and companies .
conversely , Clinton says that the state has particular tasks to fulfil , giving disadvantaged people opportunities - and it needs money to do so .
this would increase taxes for the rich , she says .
interestingly , they have similar views on infrastructure .
there has to be investment in infrastructure , Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim .
the Democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War .
State programs investing in infrastructure are classic Democrat policies , and are rejected by the tea party wing of the Republican party , which is critical of the state .
consequently , Trump could lead to discussions within the party .
there are clearer differences to be seen in terms of energy and climate policies .
Trump wants to build coal @ - @ fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up .
drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas , and he wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty .
on the other hand , Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies , saying : " one country will become the superpower of renewable energies , and create millions of jobs . "
" it will either be China , Germany or America - and I want it to be us . "
but it 's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well .
neither want to sign TTP , the trans @ - @ Pacific trade agreement .
at the same time , neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better .
they should then also be better paid , Clinton demands .
the current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance , she says .
she wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour .
it is not quite clear what Trump wants to do on this score : once he said that the minimum wage had to be raised , then he said it should stay the same .
but the big discussion of the months to come will likely revolve around both parties ' tax policies .
Trump is on one side , wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics state that this will just increase the budgetary deficit .
Clinton is on the opposite side : as a minimum , she wants the rich to pay more taxes , and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution either .
seeking refuge : " every refugee woman has dealt with sexual violence "
for women fleeing a country on their own , sexual violence is almost part of daily life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumatised .
one house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
every one of them has a baby with them , the oldest of which is one year old .
one woman holds her little son in her arms .
he looks around the room inquisitively , his eyes wide .
his mother stares at the tabletop .
until she realises she 's being watched .
she smiles briefly and kisses the child .
the scene looks normal .
until you start talking to Katrin Bahr .
she is the field manager for Condrobs , a provider of social assistance within Bavaria . one of the issues she deals with is refugee women .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich , in one of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone .
Condrobs opened the centre in January , in collaboration with Pro Familia and the Munich Women 's Help organisation .
it recently had its official opening .
60 people live there - around 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not even male visitors .
the exception is a bodyguard on the door .
" I 'm not exaggerating when I say that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge , " said Bahr .
" men flee because of war , because they are politically persecuted , because they are threatened with torture or death , or because their families pin their hopes on them and send them to Europe , " she explains .
when women flee , other reasons are in the foreground : " many women sneak away secretly , because they see no other way out . "
in their home countries , they experienced sexual violence , forced marriage , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
that propels them forward .
and it continues even while they 're on the run .
" it is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water , for example , " says Bahr .
and the woman are alone , unprotected by their families .
if you think that this stops as soon as they arrive in Germany , you 'd be wrong , says Bahr .
even in Germany , lone women are often seen as inferior in refugee accommodation , and , in the worst cases , they are abused .
as a result , around 90 percent of the women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised , she estimates .
" some of the children were certainly not conceived with the woman 's consent . "
many women are so used to it that they do not say anything , she says .
" or they can ' t bring themselves to talk about what they experienced because they are too ashamed . "
because they often don ' t know how to get help , there needs to be more accommodation just for them , says Bahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for providing accommodation for refugees .
when asked if they knew of projects like the one in Munich operating within the areas they covered , some answered with " no . "
in Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia regions , for example , there is no similar accommodation offered by the government .
even in Swabia , women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommodation , says Karl @ - @ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the region .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia , floors , or individual houses , are set aside in some shared accommodation for lone women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria : there , there are two central accommodation centres exclusively for women .
even the European Parliament 's Committee on " Women 's Rights and Gender Equality " stresses that women must be provided with accommodation separate from that of the men .
in a study published on behalf of the Committee , it was stated that " it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation . "
" if there is a lack of private space , or if men and women are provided with accommodation together , this can result in ( perpetual ) violence against women . "
washing facilities , above all , should be separate , and easily accessible for women , according to the study .
the extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich .
" since word has got around that we exist , we have developed a long waiting list , " says Bahr .
it would be easy to open a second house .
junior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September .
the JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
in a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night , the JDC 's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained " persistently silent " on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : " in light of this , the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re @ - @ negotiations on all of your concerns . "
in response to the government 's silence , JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September .
the dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all @ - @ out stoppages in the history of the NHS .
the BMA 's junior doctor leader , Dr Johann Malawana , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the BMA had recommended .
he had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England .
Russia and Turkey : an ' alliance of misfits ' ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight @ - @ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace , I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but Mr Putin 's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his " dear friend " Mr Putin - five times , according to one report .
I lost count .
he also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre @ - @ crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
but a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia 's leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : Turkey 's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was furious .
Mr Putin lashed out , accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
rebuilding real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
Russian public opinion has also turned since November .
for months , state @ - @ controlled media conducted a staggering , all @ - @ out offensive against Ankara .
all of a sudden , it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan 's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so @ - @ called Islamic State .
he 's denied that emphatically .
but in St. Petersburg came the official message that it 's time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan .
Russia could claim a victory of sorts .
for Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear .
first and foremost , Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup .
repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too .
there is also an economic motive .
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has slumped by almost 90 % .
as for Russia , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume .
they 're banking on a late @ - @ season rush to the Mediterranean .
and even this week , state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
" tourists that way , tomatoes back here , " as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
add to that its long @ - @ standing grudge at the snail 's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey 's ties with the West .
the Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
mind you , that 's a given for Moscow which has its own deep @ - @ seated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this glitzy , seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an " alliance of misfits " : two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is Syria , where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn ' t even touched on the topic .
Turkey 's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences , while Mr Putin chose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria .
but after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
the brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank 's global ambitions .
it has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out .
during that time , brand strategists have used ' RBS ' to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray .
but now , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore .
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers , but will not be initialised .
in England and Wales , all RBS references , outside head office and the stock exchange listing , will be changed to NatWest .
the Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which will get more prominence - Coutts , Adam & Co , Drummond , and Holt 's Military Bank .
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness @ - @ shire .
he told BBC Scotland : " the RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands . "
as the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became the global brand .
I 'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those brands .
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship .
" the time is right for us to move to the bank of brands , because underneath ( we 've been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? " said the chief executive .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we 'd said we 're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there .
but with the work we 've been doing , focussing on the customers needs , not our own , I think you 're seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those brands back up again , so I think the time is right .
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000 th British winner at Newmarket on Friday .
he brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on predilection , trained by John Gosden .
the 45 @ - @ year @ - @ old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing .
he follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddery and Willie Carson .
three @ - @ time champion jockey Dettori , who earlier won on Ghayyar , said : " it 's special . "
I 'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I 'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago .
it 's not a big meeting , it 's not a Royal Ascot - it 's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people .
I 'm relieved and very humble .
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in predilection after victory
two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @ - @ time champion Sir Anthony McCoy , who had more than 4,300 victories in a record @ - @ breaking career .
Lester Piggott , nine @ - @ time Derby winner , 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
he is stylish and strong , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he 'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn ' t just a weekend and big @ - @ race jockey !
seriously though , Frankie 's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he 's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that , he 's an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
from flying finishes to flying Dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades .
it has been a rollercoaster ride .
stacks of big @ - @ race winners , including his famous 1996 ' Magnificent Seven ' at Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six @ - @ month suspension , but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
Russia 's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov .
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin 's trusted inner circle for many years .
the 63 @ - @ year @ - @ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had " decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration , " but gave no reason .
Mr Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , Anton Vaino , has been appointed as his successor .
Mr Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations ( MGIMO ) and served in the Tokyo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the Kremlin website says ( in Russian ) .
on being appointed , he told Mr Putin : " thank you for your trust . "
I think the administration 's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented .
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him .
do the smiles convince ?
this is a move that has mystified Moscow .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin 's closest allies and , like him , served in the Soviet security service , the KGB .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request .
but despite the smiles for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall @ - @ out from some kind of power struggle ?
no @ - @ one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run Russia 's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism .
in remarks to Mr Putin , quoted on the Kremlin website , Mr Ivanov said " it 's true that in early 2012 I asked you , in a conversation , to entrust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troublesome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that I 've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service , like Mr Putin .
in the late 1990s , when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which replaced the KGB , Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
when Mr Putin came to power , he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin 's second term , as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional .
but that post was taken by another close Putin ally , Dmitry Medvedev .
Mr Putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three @ - @ and @ - @ a @ - @ half years later .
criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dismissal in a joint statement .
Gibson , who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner , issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced .
there were creative differences on the set and a disagreement .
I regret that it occurred , " he said in a statement .
details on how Gibson 's character will be written out of the show , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement .
the 54 @ - @ year @ - @ old , who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg , had been on the show since its first season in 2005 .
" I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years , " Gibson said in a statement released on Friday .
I had hoped to see it through to the end , but that won ' t be possible now .
I would just like to say thank you to the writers , producers , actors , our amazing crew , and , most importantly , the best fans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September .
mystery as fish land in Banff garden
a Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff .

Mr Bain , who lives about 500m from the sea , posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two @ - @ inch fish .
Queensferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fife
the £ 1.35 bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing 's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife .
it is the first of four closures between the " deck fans , " which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge 's three towers .
the bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay @ - @ cables .
the £ 1.35 bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017 .
economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
he said : " this is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing .
we 're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now in place , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said : " the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
on this fantastic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
after installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side .
this was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way .
happily , it all went very well .
Moelfre Bay rescue : three men are ' lucky to be alive '

who is going to build Braunschweig 's low @ - @ cost housing ?
the SPD and the Greens think that investors should step up to the plate much more in the future .
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low @ - @ cost homes over the next few years ?
at the next council meeting , the SPD is going to put forward an " action plan for homes . "
but it won ' t be smooth sailing .
firstly , there is the question of who is actually going to build the low @ - @ cost homes ?
so far , no settlement has been reached on this point .
SPD group chairman , Christoph Bratmann , says : " we agree with the Greens : if you want to build on municipal land , you will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future . "
the low @ - @ cost homes could also be older homes that are renovated .
however , the main issue for the council , according to Bratmann : " how do we handle investors who want to build on private ground ? "
we want investors building on those spaces to keep at least 10 percent , but if possible , 20 percent , of homes as social housing . "
a new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes , which will cost millions , and which still needs to be financed , will trigger concerns .
the problem , according to Bratmann : " at the moment , there is no agreement between groups . "
the CDU wants to put as few rules on investors as possible .
the Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors .
despite that , according to Bratman , the situation in terms of the housing market is also hotting up .
if the action plan is implemented , the building authorities will be faced with additional tasks .
more staff will be needed .
it is not clear if we will get the specialist staff .
but the program is not quite complete : because the approximately 1260 new homes are to be built anyway .
but how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low @ - @ cost homes ( approximately ) , the grants for which will run out over the next few years ?
this will come to 500 homes even by 2020 .
to prevent this , according to Nicole Palm , spokeswoman for planning policy , bonds that are about to mature should be purchased by the municipality .
in addition , thought must be given to putting homes back into a price maintenance scenario .
this is possible in the west of the city .
the problem could be solved in one fell swoop .
this is because deadlines expire at the end of the year in the west of the city .
around 1800 homes could then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing .
the only problem is that their owners , housing companies , are against it .
this would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city , taking a step back from the target of " blending . "
no longer are socially disadvantaged people to be concentrated in a small number of districts .
the Greens think there 's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions .
group chairman Holger Herlitschke thinks that " the CDU will have to get into bed with us to reach a decent majority . "
however , they have focused on providing more building sites for detached homes .
but that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise .
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
it is fascinating to see how the world turns .
that teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more , preferring to spend their free time looking at screens , has been the lament of many for the the past decade .
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity .
screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones .
so it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive .
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s ( it later spawned a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin offs ) .
like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response , which overloaded servers .
within days , Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and nearly as many as Twitter .
so how does it work ?
in a nutshell , players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons , which are tracked with a GPS and , once found , can be ' photographed ' ( via a screenshot on your phone ) or ' captured ' .
a generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze , jumping off the couch for the search .
in the US , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the " average " person each day .
Cardiogram , an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching , the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels .
many public health campaigns to get people to " find 30 , " " get off the couch " and " be active everyday " have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable .
yet the importance of exercise can not be understated .
those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
activity helps with weight management , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy .
thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun .
some people are even making new friends on the hunt .
as usual there are po @ - @ faced killjoys looking for something to complain about .
and yes somebody might walk into a door .
so what ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
for while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity , they didn ' t give us a reason to exercise like this game does .
the novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course .
however because of Pokmeon 's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Simone Biles nails all @ - @ around gold in women 's gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all of it .
dynamic on vault .
effortless on beam .
jaw @ - @ dropping on floor .
brilliant all over .
and now , finally , an Olympic champion .
the 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old American gymnast soared to the all @ - @ around title on Thursday , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight .
her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and " Final Five " teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist aliya Mustafina .
United States ' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women 's individual all @ - @ around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all @ - @ around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same league as once @ - @ in @ - @ a @ - @ generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights :
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her " the greatest gymnast I 've ever seen . "
one last test awaited in Brazil , a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family 's home in Spring , Texas , with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment .
United States ' Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women 's individual all @ - @ around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Aug .
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi 's going away party .
while Biles insisted she 's never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that 's not exactly true .
a portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena .
it 's not a coincidence .
the girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman 's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force .
she hasn ' t lost an all @ - @ around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to .
though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations , it was a mirage .
balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor .
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles ' glittery red , white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality .
Raisman 's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker .
this time , the 22 @ - @ year @ - @ old team captain the Americans call " grandma " was well ahead .
she blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt .
as for Biles , the 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old 's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
two women and a 12 @ - @ year @ - @ old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix 's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot , according to police reports released Thursday .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis ' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
the gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle , the report states .
police say the triple killing doesn ' t appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn ' t take purses or $ 2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks .
in all , seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four @ - @ month period .
" it 's occurring within a residential area in front of a home , " Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month .
the suspect is believed to have used several vehicles , including as a late @ - @ 1990s brown Nissan , a late @ - @ 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized for her injuries and later died .
liner , 31 , and Ellis ' daughter Maleah died at the scene .
a witness told police that it wasn ' t unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music .
authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half @ - @ hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer .
investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old with microcephaly : " it gets better "
like most six @ - @ year @ - @ olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but unlike most of his peers , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn ' t know about while pregnant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , I can ' t do this .
I can ' t do this .
I didn ' t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it , " she said .
she and her husband , Vincent , were told Edmund might never recognize them , and that he might not even survive .
some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized .
" my first response was ' I didn ' t think people did that anymore , ' " Picciuto explained .
Edmund walks with the help of a walker .
Edmund didn ' t sit up or crawl until he was three , and he still doesn ' t talk .
but he 's slowly meeting some milestones .
he 's walking with help , and riding a bike .
he also loves playing with his two brothers , and singing .
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for " please sing to me . "
" we 're teaching him sign language , " Picciuto told CBS News .
but it 's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs .
microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions : genetic ones like Edmund 's , and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika .
symptoms and prognosis can vary widely .
it 's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika .
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future .
I kept saying , what 's going to happen ?
what 's going to happen ?
and she still doesn ' t really know .
I actually haven ' t asked for a prognosis in forever , because I don ' t expect anyone to really be able to tell me .
but Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child , and your child will love you .
heavy rain , flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday , with more rain expected over the state through Saturday .
numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall , the National Weather Service reported .
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials , and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , said requests were coming in for high @ - @ water vehicles , boats and sandbags .
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
a flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana .
the weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area .
in south Alabama , a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area .
the Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs , both in Louisiana , were predicted to set record crests over the weekend .
forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge .
he also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat , as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas .
the Tickfaw River , just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool , Louisiana , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday .
rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster .
Hansford , 62 , says waters from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose quickly overnight .
he said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him .
" we woke up and the water kept on coming , " Hansford said .
it came up to my waist .
his wife told Hansford that it 's the highest she 's seen the creek in the 48 years she 's lived there .
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities , and he 's the only one who can swim .
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military @ - @ style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster , where they were sheltering Friday .
Krautmann says flooding is " quickly becoming widespread " as heavy rains continue , saying officials are considering evacuation orders .
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning .
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday .
heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts , authorities said .
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded .
residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding .
parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water .
shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated .
" they will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede , " he said .
in the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond , close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water , and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses .
" the last major flood we had was in March , " said city administrator Lacy Landrum .
this one is on track to be a similar event .
in Mississippi , Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast .
he said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday , but none have been reported so far Friday .
Keith Townson , manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
" I 've seen water in some places I have never seen before , " Townson said , " and it 's still coming down . "
Mahaj Brown , 6 , " riddled with bullets , " survives Philadelphia shooting
police say a 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old boy has been shot in Philadelphia , marking the second shooting of a 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old in the city this week .
the child 's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
the grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in his groin , leg , arm and abdomen , but was awake when he was transported to the hospital .
" he just took a lot , his little body was riddled with bullets , " his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station .
I just can ' t believe it .
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries .
family tells the station he is expected to recover .
he was set to start first grade at a local elementary school .
brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section .
also shot were three men : two 29 @ - @ year @ - @ olds and one 32 @ - @ year old .
one of the 29 @ - @ year @ - @ old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to CBS Philadelphia .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29 @ - @ year @ - @ old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter .
investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen .
assault weapon @ - @ style shell casings , traced to different assault style weapons , littered the scene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were casings in the street , on both sides of the sidewalk .
so it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged , " Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station .
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video .
another 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old , a girl , was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood .
she is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
that 's what I call this year 's Women 's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one .
first , I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three gymnasts , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren " Laurie " Hernandez , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
the make @ - @ up of this team , rounded out by Aly Raisman , who is Jewish , and Madison Kocian , who is Catholic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like America .
it also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female gymnast has been African @ - @ American .
last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion , and America cheered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three @ - @ time World Champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected , yet masterful gymnastics routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women 's individual all @ - @ around event .
and teammate Aly Raisman earned silver .
we are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team .
they are the " Final Five " because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team , and this is Marta Karolyi 's last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the coaches and their gymnasts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business .
these clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training , and it 's a costly and long @ - @ term commitment for the gymnasts ' families .
Aimee Boorman , coach of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , coach of Laurie Hernandez , have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie .
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organizations , we have provided free and low @ - @ cost gymnastics , based in Harlem , for over 15,000 urban youth ( primarily black and Hispanic ) and have trained national and international champions .
in September , we will be expanding to Detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life @ - @ long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of " Girl Power " in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
in July , Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in " no man 's land " and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the BMA 's junior doctors " committee chair , said in a statement last night : " junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . "
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and , at times , deafening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open .
" Jeremy Hunt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address junior doctors " concerns .
if he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line .
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials .
the BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , chief executive of NHS Employers , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
Mr Mortimer said : " industrial action achieves little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , carers and their families . "
over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have , along with the Department of Health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of syllabus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @ - @ a @ - @ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2 @ - @ a @ - @ day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti @ - @ clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack .
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build @ - @ up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque .
if the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
Ticagrelor , which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making clots less likely .
the draft NICE guidance , published today , recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months , followed by 60 mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years .
Professor Carole Longson , director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre , said : " despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences . "
fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
the evidence shows that ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
ex @ - @ Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption , prompting the government report
a culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
ex @ - @ Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police , election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of " over @ - @ sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . "
the former communities secretary , now the anti @ - @ corruption tsar , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person 's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to whistleblowers , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
" this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , " he said .
the report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London .
last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found Rahman " cynically perverted " the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia .
Rahman , it was said , " ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him . "
up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
his report says : " evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elders , especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background .
" there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of " politically correct " over @ - @ sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . "
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop " vote harvesting . "
the report , being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting .
use indelible ink on a person 's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person 's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three @ - @ year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes .
give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations ( except in Wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone .
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police , saying it is " astonishing " that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case .
" the election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , " he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also criticises the ineffectual " tick @ - @ box inspections " of town hall electoral registration departments .
Sir Eric said : " last year 's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake @ - @ up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
crazy for Kate 's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand @ - @ Prevot , who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @ - @ year @ - @ old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media .
so , in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment , FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs .
the hunter and the wolf : U. S. Men 's Archery Team member Brady Ellison , left , has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
aside from Kate 's doppelganger on the cycling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A @ - @ lister Leonardo DiCaprio .
U. S. Men 's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced .
and in fact , the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid .
' i personally don ' t see a huge resemblance , maybe besides the facial hair , ' Brady told Huffington Post .
' he is a good @ - @ looking dude so I guess it 's a compliment . '
one of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian gymnast aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban @ - @ American singer Gloria Estefan .
and over in the pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to glee star Matthew Morrison for years now .

the idiot didn ' t realize they were still on the air . '

we sincerely regret that these statements were made , and that they were allowed to go to air .

Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
shoppers didn ' t know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark .
to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , peeled them off and put them back on the shelf .
she carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre , Folkestone .
the Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre , Folkestone , where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
a mother @ - @ of @ - @ two , Jenny Davidson , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman ' got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything . '
she said : ' people couldn ' t believe what they were seeing . '
standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of knickers from the display , stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on .
' She didn ' t try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there , bold as brass . '
' Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn ' t like them because she put them back on the shelf . '
she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out .
' She didn ' t seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she 'd been trying on . '
Ms Davidson , 33 , who lives in the Kent town , said : ' how disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven ' t been cleaned . '
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davidson added : ' I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well . '
' i 'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they hadn ' t been washed . '
a Primark spokesman said : ' Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9 . '
all the product in question has been removed from sale .
how to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
it 's a dangerous world out there , but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to Rhon Mizrachi , New York @ - @ based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation , to find out how to deal with gun @ - @ toting muggers at close range .
whether you 're approached from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger .
if approached from behind , Mizrachi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your attacker and ' clear the line of fire ' .
you then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow .
a knee to the groin follows , and while the attacker doubles up in pain , you twist the gun from his hands , smack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
for gunmen approaching from the front , it 's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can ' t fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
sounds tricky ?
check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it .
but remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you 're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash .
traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe 's dirtiest places for travel guide
a British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe .
presenter and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk , scraped his tongue along a Euro note , a Piccadilly Circus hand rail , a train toilet 's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system .
before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show himself , and us , just what he was getting in to .
but the experiment , which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength , threw up some surprising results .
the thought of licking a train 's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
all the way along his trip through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately , nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things .
from public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
in the movie made about it he said : ' ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I 've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil , eating worms and muddy water . '
he certainly proved his reputation during the film .
the only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet .
his sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units .
by comparison , freshly washed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units , when freshly washed hands are less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller 's film called The Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
he said in the film : ' that is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet . '
there 's nothing more dirty than that !
I 'm not going to lick anything because it 's disgusting in there .
the Lickhiker 's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio .
the company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people 's gut bacteria and immune systems .
Valio 's Senior Vice President of Snacks , Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said : ' we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics .
we did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea " let 's call Ian . "
they claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it 's linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour !
Tom HAKALA , who directed the film , added : ' let 's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to , like the disgusting Russian toilet that 's shown in the film . '
naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick , some were pretty tough .
I 'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape . '
in a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio , 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well @ - @ being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria .
family of yobs destroyed Saltash , Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
a family of yobs left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash , Cornwall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were forcibly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair .
the walls were left with gaping holes , floorboards were ripped up , rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy , housing manager at Cornwall Housing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
she said : ' it 's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don ' t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not @ - @ so @ - @ nice element of Cornwall .
this family are notorious and their name is notorious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats , intimidating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shouting , arguing and swearing .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the tenancy , was given an antisocial behaviour order in June .
old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demolished
floor boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
the eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
one said : ' they didn ' t care about anybody . '
we lived next to them for 20 years and it 's always been bad .
the amount of times we 've seen the police down here is unbelievable .
' This morning , we couldn ' t sleep . '
we got up because it was so quiet here - we 're not used to that !
it 's going to be lovely now that they 're finally gone .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Cornwall Housing 's neighbourhood enforcement manager , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
he added : ' it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness .
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s .
a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
in 2014 , police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and £ 1,700 in cash .
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son , Lee Skeldon , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
after being made homeless , it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth .
the walls of many of the house 's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them .
police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow , of Devon and Cornwall Police , said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules .
' This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination , as well as those blighted by such behaviour , ' she said .
criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal are left terrified as a low @ - @ flying military jet flies skims beach
tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro , Portugal , had the shock of their lives
a Portuguese air force P @ - @ 3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
the air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
this is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low @ - @ flying jet swooped down over a packed beach .
dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro , northern Portugal .
holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds .
the incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon .
Daniel Fernandes , one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly @ - @ by onto social media , said : ' it passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash . '
Nuno Arroja added : ' I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me . '
tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
the Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P @ - @ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them .
he said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires , but the air force insisted no @ - @ one 's safety had been compromised .
wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
the plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup : Barca is worried about facing Sevilla
Seville - On Sunday , FC Barcelona will fight to take their first step towards their first title of the new football season .
the Catalan team will face off against FC Sevilla in an away game in Spain 's Supercup ; the second leg will take place three days later in Camp Nou .
the two @ - @ time champions will have to face up to the defeated Cup finalists and reigning Europa League champions without Neymar , who is playing in the Olympic football tournament for Brazil .
in addition , goalkeeper Marc @ - @ Andre ter Stegen is also missing .
during training the German pulled a ligament in his knee . at least it 's clear who 'll be wearing the number one jersey for Barca : Claudio Bravo .
the Chilean international and Ter steigen have been competing for number one status for two years now .
coach Luis Enrique has so far refused to make a clear decision either way , allowing Bravo to wear the jersey in league games , but giving it to Ter Stegen in most of their other matches .
ahead of the first compulsory game of the new season there were doubts as to the Spanish champions ' fitness : they lost 0 @ - @ 4 to Liverpool in a friendly game on Saturday .
even with 3 @ - @ 2 in a friendly against Sampdoria on Wednesday , Lionel Messi and co. were not really all that convincing .
on the other hand , Sevilla have to swallow their 2 @ - @ 3 extra @ - @ time defeat against Real Madrid in the Supercup , and are aiming for a second victory in the " Supercopa de Espana . "
with eleven victories , Barcelona are the current record @ - @ holders for this competition .
ma Long is in a league of his own , taking Gold in the table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - Ma Long , from China , is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday , the 27 @ - @ year @ - @ old beat his fellow countryman and " defending champion " Zhang Jike in Rio de Janeiro 4 @ - @ 0 in a one @ - @ sided final ( 12,5,4,4 ) .
this gave the world number one the " golden grand slam , " winning the World Championship , the World Cup , the final tournament of the World Tour , and the Olympics .
the bronze medal went to Jun Mizutani from Japan .
the two Chinese men made it to the final , as expected , and fought each other for the title .
it was clear that , for the third time in a row , a Chinese athlete would take the singles title at the Olympics .
the last non @ - @ Chinese athlete on the top step of the Olympic podium was former SVS Lower Austria legionary Ryu Seung @ - @ min from South Korea .
ma and Zhang were alone at the table : they had no coaches with them between sets and during time @ - @ outs .
they had returned to the stands , leaving their charges alone to fight a fair battle against each other .
" up until now , I have played for my country . "
" in the final , I 'm playing for myself , " Zhang summarised .
after the game , the gold and silver medallists posed with the Chinese flag .
the match itself was unexpectedly one @ - @ sided .
ma only had to fight off his 28 @ - @ year @ - @ old opponent in the first set .
afterwards , he set the pace on the table , and only let Zhang score a total of 13 points .
ma 's dominance meant that the match was not as exciting as expected .
but nevertheless , there were some breathtaking volleys to be seen .
Mizutani won the bronze medal match against 40 @ - @ year @ - @ old Wladimir Samsonow 4 @ - @ 1 .
the Belarussian had injured his rib in his quarter @ - @ final against German European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov , and was given medical treatment , and ultimately had to content himself with fourth place .
Jan @ - @ Ove Waldner from Sweden ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jörgen Persson ( 42 / 2008 ) also reached fourth place at the Olympics at a similarly old age for table tennis .
Donald Trump admits there are " huge problems " with his election campaign
the US Republicans ' lead is plagued by significant fears that they might lose their majority , even in states that are traditionally conservative .
presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to the weaknesses of his election campaign in Utah , formerly a Republican stronghold .
it was a strange moment - the multi @ - @ millionaire normally puts on a pompous , self @ - @ assured performance , but this time he expressed something analogous to doubt , as correspondents report .
after he had beaten 16 rivals from within the Republican camp , doubt is now growing as to whether he will be successful in the race for the White House .
" we have huge problems in Utah , " Trump said to an audience of evangelical Christians whom he asked for assistance in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
he blamed false reports on his candidacy , once again giving the media a dressing @ - @ down , as he is known to do .
Republican strongholds are wavering
Utah is normally a safe seat for the Republicans .
a poll carried out by SurveyUSA in June puts Trump and his competitor on an equal footing with Democrat Hillary Clinton .
other bodies do put Trump ahead , but not by the margin usual for Republican candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk .
in an interview with broadcaster CNBC , Trump was asked how he would stop Clinton 's rise , replying : " in the same way I have done before . "
and he added : " either it 'll work out , or I 'll go on a long , long holiday . "
he said he was just " telling the truth . "
if he doesn ' t make it because of political correctness , that 's ok , Trump added .
then , he said , I 'd return to a very nice way of life .
according to press reports , the party have threatened Trump with removing financial support for his election campaign if he is unable to do any better in the polls .
instead , the Republican congressional candidates would be offered more support .
Olympics : brazen cheating in doping tests
the IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee to handle the case .
following the second doping scandal at the Rio Olympics , trouble is looming for Kenya 's track and field athletes .
after an attempt to deceive a doping check in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent one coach home .
the International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case .
a Kenyan official announced that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had given a urine sample in the Olympic village in the name of 800 @ - @ metre runner Ferguson Rotich .
Kenya 's team managers were allegedly informed of this by the doping officials .
the global IAAF federation has requested information about the matter from the IOC so it can carry out its own investigations , stated an IAAF spokesperson .
" the IAAF will perform an evaluation , depending on the findings of the investigation and the steps taken by the IOC as a result , " said an IAAF statement .
" he ( Anzrah ) went to the doping check and alleged that he was Ferguson Rotich , handed in the sample , and signed for it , " explained Stephan Arap Soi , Kenya 's Chef de Mission .
he had the athlete 's accreditation as given in the list of training checks for the World Anti @ - @ Doping Agency .
Ferguson Rotich came fourth in the 800 @ - @ metre race at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing .
four days previously , the Head of the Kenyan track & field delegation , Michael Rotich , had been sent away from the Rio games .
he was alleged to have told sportspeople from his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport .
after numerous instances of doping , the IOC has been keeping a particularly close eye on Kenya for a while .
when the IOC announced that it would hold more than 2000 targeted doping checks in advance of the Rio games , it also announced , unusually , that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be examined particularly closely .
ahead of the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @ - @ Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to introduce an anti @ - @ doping law and a functioning system of checks .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
following this , WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti @ - @ doping measures comply with WADA rules .
running is a national sport in Kenya .
the country 's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 world championships in Beijing .
in a series of televised reports by ARD , the claim was made time and again that doping drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a mentality of cheating at sport .
IOC member Richard Pound has recently called for an investigation in Kenya to mirror that which took place into Russian athletics .
this investigation proved that doping was undertaken extensively and systematically across the sport .
as a result , Russia 's track and field athletes were banned from the summer games .
Salzburg 's " West Side Story " with Cecilia Bartoli
in the Shakespeare anniversary year , the Salzburger Festspiele is putting on " West Side Story " with Tony and Maria as tragic couple just like Romeo and Juliet .
featuring a surprise : Cecilia Bartoli .
a musical has gripped Salzburg : Leornard Bernstein 's masterpiece , " West Side Story . "
artistic Director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music , and has made a childhood dream come true by taking on the role of Maria .
in the orchestra pit , the Simón Bolívar Orchestra will be conducted by Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel : " this music is full of rhythm , " he enthuses .
we always say that it has a lot of Latin American influences .
there are many Latin American elements in its tempo and melodies .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect formula for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein 's music in our blood !
in this production , Bartoli plays an older Maria .
she remembers her love affair with Tony with wistfulness , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Maria has always fascinated me .
firstly because it 's musically unusual !
and then there 's Maria 's personality .
as she says in her song : " I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and witty and bright . "
so she 's clever , and naive of course , and full of passion .
" she 's very like me , like my Italian personality as a girl from Rome , " laughs Bartoli .
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer : " Cecilia is a wonderful artist . "
we are so honoured to work with her .
she is an incredibly generous person .
and Bartoli returns the compliment : " Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and so passionate ! "
for him , conducting is a need .
you see it in all his movements , his glances - it is his life !
it is such a great chance to be able to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temperament , fire , passion , and we both approach life with joy , which is the most important of all !
for the American director Philip Wm . McKinley , " West Side Story " is bang up @ - @ to @ - @ date : " this work is all about prejudice and fanaticism . "
today we 're dealing with the refugees , back then Puerto Ricans had gone to New York , and the residents of New York didn ' t want them there .
it 's the same issues , and they were as significant then as they are today .
fifty @ - @ nine years on , the work is still relevant .
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL , has reportedly died in Syria .
attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa , Syria , a few weeks ago .
she was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa , the group 's stronghold in the country , ITV News reported on Thursday .
sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died just as she was making plans to flee the war @ - @ torn country and return to Britain .
" one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really , " Akunjee said .
in February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border .
sultana 's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months .
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president .
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland 's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia .
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland " with some degree of credibility . "
a spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating .
he praised Garland and said Clinton 's team would not want to " rock the boat " with a new pick .
Garland is the chief judge for the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit .
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland 's nomination are " minions " and " enablers " of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
he said Trump is unfit for office .

Turkey : Kurdish community faces mass exodus
" if you don ' t change your tune and praise Erdogan , your suitcase is basically packed , " says the President of the Gülen @ - @ supporting Dialogue and World foundation , Ercan Karakoyun .
the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people to arrive at short notice in search of protection , fleeing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , this could even grow to " a few hundred thousand , " believes Ali Toprak , President of the association .
the crackdown instigated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to Germany .
" in the short term I 'm expecting ten thousand , in the medium term a few hundred thousand people coming from Turkey looking for protection in Germany , if the Erdogan regime continues to antagonise minorities and democratic opposition , " said the President of the Association , Ali Toprak , to " Die Welt " newspaper on Friday .
a few months ago the government initiated punitive action against Kurdish strongholds - and as a result , 500,000 Kurds are already on the run within Turkey .
after the unsuccessful coup , secular and oppositional ethnic Turks have been added to the list .
many will want to seek a new start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Turkey .
" it is unacceptable that a country that takes in refugees is also producing them , " said Toprak .
the head of the Association complained about the deliberate relocating of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and Alevi towns .
he thinks that Erdogan did this to encourage the remaining Kurds to leave .
" they are the last big minority in Turkey : the Christian Armenians and the Greeks have already been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years , " said Toprak , who is also a member of the CDU .
the head of the Association requested that the Federal Government acted " as harshly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . "
a " witch @ - @ hunt " is also underway in Germany against those critical of Erdogan .
over the past few months , I have no longer felt safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and members of the opposition .
being singled out as a Gülen @ - @ supporter is career @ - @ destroying for teachers and other academics .
" if you don ' t change your tune and praise Erdogan , your suitcase is basically packed , " said the President of the Gülen @ - @ supporting Dialogue and World Foundation , Ercan Karakoyun , to " Die Welt " newspaper .
as the newspaper reports , using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , even before the coup Turks were the largest group granted asylum in Germany on the grounds of political persecution .
on the reference date of June 30 , this amounted to 11,386 people , almost 29 percent of all people entitled to asylum ( 39,625 ) .
these figures do not include people who have fled war , poverty or a lack of prospects .
under the constitution , only individuals suffering political persecution , i.e. , on the part of the state , are entitled to asylum .
Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern : " go where it hurts "
strange Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern : locals hear nothing about the summer elections - and holidaymakers from North Rhine @ - @ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament .
in Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern , they understood this .
in 2021 the state parliament elections will not take place at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwerin parliament decided at the start of the year .
the way things had been going was simply ridiculous : summer holidays , heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another .
the locals who need to be won over by the candidates are on holiday .
most holidaymakers in the state , in Usedom , Rügen or Hiddensee , are not locals - and are not allowed to vote for the state parliament .
there are also practical problems to consider : during the holidays , volunteers who put up signs , blow up balloons , distribute flyers and count the votes at the end , are hard to find .
until 4 September 2016 , election day and the last day of the holidays , people in Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern must put up with one more election without the people being consulted .
the heated phase , if that can be said at all , has already begun .
and there 's something at stake : Prime Minister Erwin Sellering , leader of an SPD / CDU coalition , is fearing for his seat .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU , according to polls .
it will be exciting to see how Neuling AfD carves things up , and whether a coalition can be formed with what 's left at the end .
Sellering , 66 years old and head of the parliament since 2008 , pursued a rather inconspicuous election campaign , as can be seen from his posters .
he is travelling around the region , distributing roses and chatting a bit with people , just as his legendarily taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did .
apart from that , Seelering has got cold feet , blaming Chancellor Merkel for the rise of the AfD .
her refugee policies , her " we can manage it " have accelerated the rise of the far @ - @ right , he believes - which will probably cost him his job .
the CDU and its top @ - @ level candidate , Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier , has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time .
the CDU have invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to two mass rallies ; Merkel 's parliamentary constituency is in the north @ - @ east .
but the target group wasn ' t right : there were more people from North Rhine @ - @ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony there than people from Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern .
" the majority probably came from other federal states , " Vincent Kokert , general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern , complained to the NDR recently .
but it won ' t do any harm to anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkal for once .
apart from that , the north @ - @ east CDU is generally dispensing with the normal election events with parasols and balloons in market squares and outside shopping centres .
according to Kokert , that will only play a " minor role . "
the Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region , and will have to work hard to connect with the people .
they are suffering like the Left , the SPD , the Greens : hardly present across large swathes of the region .
the advice that CDU candidate Kokert gave to his competitors is revealing : " you have got to go where it hurts , or where the people are : village fetes , Golden Wedding anniversaries , you have to make use of every birthday party . "
Sellering has already called his SPD to fight a particularly committed election campaign because there is so much at stake .
according to polls , the social democrats have 22 percent , behind their partners the CDU ( 25 ) , and only fractionally ahead of the AfD ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 elections , the SPD had a clear victory over the CDU ( 35.6 percent versus 22 percent ) .
the Greens , a small party with seven percent in the polls , should make the leap into the regional parliament .
they are making a modern virtue out of the holiday issue , and are waging their election war predominantly online .
" online election campaign " is what the regional chairperson Claudia Müller has dubbed it .
apart from that , the Greens are searching out local voters among the holidaymakers .
Silke Gajek , their top candidate , is currently crossing Mecklenburg 's lakes on a houseboat - and is having a nice time .
her view ? " having an election holiday in Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern isn ' t all that bad . "
B27 redevelopment : restaurants are suffering from the closure
there are hardly any problems with the speed at which the B27 is being redeveloped .
there is praise from all quarters for the people responsible for the construction works , which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m .
" they have done everything so speedily , " Elvira Texlaff at the Jet petrol station explains .
that is a super team .
there are also no delays .
at the start of the week , the construction site could be moved southwards in line with plans , marking the half @ - @ way point , and everything is expected to be completed by October .
the obligingness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute driveways .
since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday , and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened , and the link to Rottenburg was re @ - @ established , the traffic situation within the town has improved .
residents can now drive on both sides of the B 27 out of Ofterdingen .
there seem to be fewer drivers taking alternative routes through the town .
" there were some serious complaints made , " said Florian King , deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment .
residents in Bachsatzstraße , Steinlachstraße , Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to put up with more traffic noise because people were looking for ways to cut through , trusting their satnav more than the signage .
this led to some lorries hurtling through residential areas .
the commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either .
" there were considerable infringements , " said King , who had taken a look on @ - @ site to see what was going on .
two to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute .
the fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , things have quietened down .
this is only a small consolation for businesses located along the B 27 that the road has reopened for customers from Rottenburg .
business people don ' t like to show their hand .
but nobody we questioned hid the fact that the B 27 redevelopment had led to a drop in profits .
however , some have been affected more than others .
people who have little to do with " end customers , " i.e. if they make products for other companies , have hardly been affected by the redevelopment .
even at the Maier car dealership , Thomas Sulz talked of " a slight loss , at the most , " but also admitted that " there had been a lack of passing trade . "
bars and restaurants along the road had been the hardest hit .
J. Albert Göhner , owner of the Steakhouse ( previously Krone ) , expressed himself clearly .
it has threatened our very existence .
it 's not just him : all restaurants have been " hit hard . "
customers from Hechingen , Balingen and Rottweil stayed away .
we have to be happy about every euro of profit we make .
he reckons that profits slumped by " far more than 50 percent . "
the road redevelopment " set back " his businesses " by two years . "
he had to let half of his staff go .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go , politicians would have reacted differently .
instead , when Göhner asked the government 's president , Jörg Schmidt , if there would be financial compensation , the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27 . and now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment .
Göhner knows of other districts where people have acted more generously .
despite all the complains , Göhner is convinced that his restaurant will survive .
after all , the family business moved there back in 1715 , he said , referring to its long history .
he can understand that his regular customers visit less as a result of the complicated traffic system .
if you can ' t drive past , other places are also nice .
Göhner has no doubt that his regulars will return once the redevelopment works have been completed .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , Göhner believes that the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele mark the biggest crisis his restaurant has suffered in its long history .
six months of construction works , that 's brutal .
law are constantly being passed in the name of anti @ - @ terrorism .
after the most recent attacks , Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now putting forward a host of security measures .
but what does residential status have to do with terrorism ?
and what does the coalition partner have to say about it all ?
Thomas de Maizière is playing the conciliator .
all his proposals are " politically reasonable " for the coalition partner , the Federal Minister of the Interior said when revealing his new security package .
they are not asking too much of anyone .
other , more wide @ - @ reaching issues will first be discussed within the parties .
I will also be involved in that .
as Minister of the Interior , however , he is responsible for results , and for reaching an " achievable agreement " within the coalition , he says .
after the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach , de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany .
however , they are more comprehensive as a result .
one thing was already known , announced , heralded : the fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new .
neither is the fact that Germany will have to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and gun laws .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise .
to some extent , de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with : he wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups , and remove German passports from jihadis with dual citizenship .
" they will be difficult issues for the SPD , " admitted the CDU politician .
despite this , he believes they are achievable , and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner .
de Maizière also presented a few new ideas .
some of them have a lot to offer : he is planning accelerated processes for deportation and more opportunities to arrest individuals prior to their deportation .
refugees who are specifically brought to the country should allow their smartphones to be checked , and present their social media accounts for security checks .
he wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes , or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity .
some of it is politically and legally tricky .
some of it also seems half @ - @ baked , and leaves questions to be answered .
and for some points - such as the unequal treatment of tolerated persons - the following question is raised : what does that actually have to do with security and terrorism ?
yes , de Maizière says , it is important to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees , and the issue of terrorism .
but it can not be denied that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people are worried about security because of the large numbers of refugees .
and things that deeply worry people can not be ignored - even during election season .
domestic security has come to the fore to a huge extent .
first the attacks in neighbouring countries : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach .
there is a large amount of uncertainty .
and yes , elections are looming .
the Union and the SPD are consequently focusing more and more on the issue of security .
over the past few days things have been quite heated between the two parties .
first a nasty argument about the Federal Police Force 's equipment , then about an ideas @ - @ gathering event for security and politics @ - @ related discussions between some Ministers of the Interior in the Union , at which a burka ban and the renunciation of dual citizenship were demanded by department heads .
de Maizière is also trying to strike a conciliatory note here .
he does not think that dual citizenship will be removed .
we have dealt with the discussions in Germany .
it would not make sense to reopen discussions on this topic .
and he thinks that a burka ban would come up against constitutional issues .
however , it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution throughout , and whether it really is " achievable " for his coalition partner .
there are few things inside it that could cause problems .
but the SPD is also currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape itself .
SPD Head Sigmar Gabriel showed that the party was happy to discuss the issue , albeit sensitively at first , saying that " the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further . "
Volkswagen gets off lightly .
despite the diesel scandal , global delivery figures are increasing .
but things aren ' t quite as rosy in all markets .
the recall has led to fuss about one term .
Volkswagen 's deliveries were more restrained in the second half of the year .
thanks to its number of brands and some well @ - @ functioning markets , Europe 's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year , despite the diesel scandal .
however , in July , the VW core brand suffered , particularly in Western Europe , thereby affecting overall sales , as the Dax @ - @ listed company announced .
globally , the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July - 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market after China , sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month the year before .
in its home market of Germany , deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth .
head of brand sales , Jürge Stackmann , blamed July 's poor figures on the loss of two sales days in Europe .
in addition , some key markets saw " changed economic climates , " which led to fewer purchases .
in addition to the situation regarding the attempted coup in Turkey , the British vote to leave the EU had also had an impact , a spokeswoman said .
in the USA , where the emissions scandal first began , the books are once again in the red .
the Chinese market is a source of great support for VW .
in total , Lower Saxony 's own brand , which was most affected , has got off lightly from the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , there is a minus in the books for deliveries amounting to 0.9 percent of 3.37 million vehicles .
head of sales at the company , Fred Kappler , was once again able to bring out an increase in sales from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time period , coming to a global total of 5.904 million .
Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions tests .
in Germany alone , VW has called 2.5 million vehicles back to workshops to be refitted .
in the course of modifying the vehicles VW emphasised that refitting them would have no negative effects .
after the vehicles have been modified , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse .
after modification , the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is " as good as a guarantee " but would not talk of an actual " guarantee , " as was mentioned on Friday in corporate circles .
legal intricacies are the reason for this .
" focus " reported that Volkswagen would provide its German customers with a guarantee for modified diesel cars nonetheless .
this was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on the Monday previous .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place .
" VW must fully meet the requirements of my investigative committee and the KBA . "
" deviations will not be accepted , " explained Alexander Dobrindt ( CDU ) , the Federal Minister for Transport , according to the Ministry .
VW took on the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse as a result of the modification , and all vehicle values relevant to type approval would remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term " guarantee , " as has been mentioned in corporate circles .
Volkswagen believes that the broad term " guarantee " could see customers returning to the workshop with motor damage six months after the modification - and being able to blame this on the new software , even if the damage had nothing at all to do with it .
it is also in the customers ' interest to prevent confusion with guarantee clauses for any other faults that have nothing at all to do with the emissions scandal .
this is why VW will not be using the term " guarantee . "
the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so .
managing Director of the bank , Josef Paul , said on Thursday that " this only applies to 139 customers with 40 million euros in their current accounts or day @ - @ to @ - @ day accounts . "
the Federal Association of German Banks believes this is an isolated case , and does not see it as a sign : normal savers " need not worry about being hit with penalty interest on the pennies they 've put aside . "
if banks invest money overnight with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay penalty interest of 0.4 percent .
from September , the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day @ - @ to @ - @ day account to pay this fee .
" the first 100,000 euros are free . "
" in the future , any subsequent 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year , " Paul said .
for some time , he has been managing 40 million euros that could be withdrawn any day , and that he is unable to make use of .
" the money has been sitting in my account at the Central Bank , and costing 0.4 percent , " the bank CEO said .
" I can not put 4000 euros aside for every million . "
he is passing on the costs under the " polluter pays " principle .
it would be far too dangerous just to leave the cash in the Raffeisen Bank 's safe : " I have already been through four raids , I don ' t want a fifth ! " the bank 's managing director said .
most customers have been understanding , and have switched to other forms of investment .
only a small number moved to other banks .
the Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that " the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring significant costs . "
it would be " impossible " for them to bear these costs " on a permanent basis , from a business perspective . "
as a result , some German banks have increased the fees they charge for account management , credit cards or transfers .
Thuringia 's " Volks - und Raffeisen Bank " in Altenburger Land hit the headlines in 2014 when their Skatbank branch imposed penalty interest on investments of more than three million euros .
Michael Kemmer , managing director of the banking association , said : " we are not expecting that private customers will all have to pay fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for that . "
a banker said that , in Tegernsee , there was " clientele who were rather better off in terms of assets . "
" that can be a problem for a small bank , " if the bank is looking after their money for free .
the Cooperative Bank of Gmund was founded in 1911 , and has branches in Bad Wiessee , Rottach @ - @ Egern , Kreuth and Tegernsee .
famous actors , sportspeople and enterpreneurs live in the region .
spokesperson Ernst said that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria " was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their expenses . "
the President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken ( BVR ) , Uwe Fröhlich , said at the end of June that " the threshold for tipping into the red in terms of private customers is very , very high . "
competition is fierce , and there is the risk that investors will move to competitors .
customers in Germany will not put up with that , broadly speaking .
vinyl destination : who is actually buying records ?
lonely , middle @ - @ aged men love vinyl .
before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen , this statement derives from actual data .
according to YouGov , the much talked @ - @ about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item , but by midlife nostalgia .
those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 , apparently .
in fact , those in the 18 @ - @ 24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists , either - it has emotional significance : older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves ( 56 % versus 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % versus 66 % ) .
but are YouGov 's results true ?
if this blog was a televised news report , the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street , wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping , cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like : " so , let 's take a look . "
so , let 's take a look .
while the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and Grot - hotels , Eats , Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain .
I 'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit , in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation .
Glaswegian Stuart , 55 , whom I follow from Sister Ray ( data count : two young women , three middle @ - @ aged men ) into Reckless Records ( data count : eight middle @ - @ aged men , one woman , probably in her 20s ) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
" I suppose I am , " he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he emailed me the snap , I didn ' t follow him home ) , line his living room walls .
his reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn ' t afford when they originally came out , and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint .
" a lot of the stuff I get is late 60s , early 70s , things that came out when I was 11 or 12 , things I was probably a bit too young to get , " he says .
he agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company , adding : " I don ' t smoke , I don ' t drink very much .
it 's my vice .
Wez , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile .
he has , however , noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype , people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records .
from conversations I 've had , people have got rid of their collection , normally around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back , " he says .
that may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types .
according to Wez , some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular .
some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve , of items that recall halcyon teenage memories .
" I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort , " Wez says .
as a collector myself , I have that , and I think a lot of people do .
it 's an easy way to occupy your headspace .
" we 're like their social workers ! " pipes up a co @ - @ worker from a stack of records .
an ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it .
the poll also found that 41 % have a turntable they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase vinyl don ' t own a record player .
at this stage of the news report , I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations .
the " trophy " aspect of the revival is something that Jonny , 42 , who works in Sounds of the Universe ( data count : three midde @ - @ aged men ) has noticed .
" someone came in recently and said : " I don ' t have a record player , but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf , " " he says .
that 's not a large percentage , but it 's definitely happening .
more of the product side , less of the music .
we have people saying : " I don ' t have a record player . "
that 's younger people , not older ones , late teens who are just getting into it .
Fopp , which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl , has a far more varied audience when I arrive .
there are couples in their 70s , tourists taking photos , teenage boys and middle @ - @ aged women .
while the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast 's latest synth - and sex @ - @ fuelled pop , rather than noodling jazz , is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers .
none of them look particularly lonely , but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes , looking at the variety of records on sale .
she is window @ - @ shopping , rather than on a spending spree .
she doesn ' t earn a lot , she says , so collecting records isn ' t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it 's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way , but the beauty of vinyl is ... " she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh .
I don ' t know how to explain - it 's really unique .
my last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers : urban Outfitters .
while giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants , I observe a group of teenage girls , who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily , before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player .
to the left is a stairwell , a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mix of contemporary and classics , the essential records for any average collection .
nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration , some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them .
it is pure " art vinyl . "
but , given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more , there is little to complain about .
it is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl .
but while my findings suggest YouGov 's results are accurate , in Soho record stores at least , they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality , in record shops and on online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street , flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy , 30 @ - @ year @ - @ old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle @ - @ aged men .

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer haircuts , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40p ) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
the Calais prefect 's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free meals offered by a state @ - @ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need .
a Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops , but said the Calais prefect 's concerns " were totally understandable . "
the judge , Jean @ - @ François Molla , said the groceries , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that " live in extremely precarious conditions . "
he said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp 's Jungle Book Kids " Cafe which is run not @ - @ for @ - @ profit and provides 200 meals a day , English and French classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
more than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids " cafe .
a letter sent to the Guardian said its closure " would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . "
two charities , Help Refugees and L ' Auberge des Migrants , on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment , Martin keeps his fighting spirit
despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial , cycling professional Tony Martin will keep his chin up .
" I 'm going to keep the World Championship in my sights , stay optimistic , and keep fighting , " wrote the 31 @ - @ year @ - @ old on Facebook on Thursday ahead of his journey home from Rio .
he was unable to provide an explanation for his poor finish in 12th place on Sugar Loaf Mountain .
" it 's honestly hard for me to comment on my time from yesterday , " said Martin .
he said he needed to reflect and analyse the reasons behind the debacle .
Martin had wanted to compete for the title at the time trial World Championship in Qatar in October .
" I 'm going to take a real look at everything we 've changed recently . "
" this also includes my position , " wrote the three @ - @ time time trial World Champion , who had lost to Olympic gold medallist Fabian Cancellara ( Switzerland ) by more than three minutes over the course of the 54.5 km race on Wednesday .
Olympics : tennis pro Siegemund misses out on the semi @ - @ final
Laura Siegemund 's reign of success comes to an end in the Rio quarter @ - @ final : ranked 32 in the world , the player from Metzingen will definitely miss out on the semi @ - @ final of the Olympic tennis tournament after losing 1 : 6 , 1 : 6 against Monic Puig ( Puerto Rico / WTA no .
34 ) .
Sigemund , who has been struggling with back problems , was only able to hold her serve once , and seemed powerless in comparison to earlier rounds .
on Thursday , potential medallist Angelique Kerber ( Kiel / no . 2 ) had the chance of making the semi @ - @ final .
the winner of the Australian Open faced off against Brit Johanna Konta ( no . 10 ) .
the last German tennis player to win was Tommy Haas , who took the silver medal in Sydney in 2000 .
the last time there were two German tennis players in the quarter @ - @ finals of the summer games was in 1992 .
there has never been a German @ - @ German Olympic semi @ - @ final .
company gets involved in start @ - @ up for live video game streaming
watching other people play video games is a huge trend - and Microsoft wants to profit from this too .
the technology company has purchased start @ - @ up Beam , which has specialised in this hobby .
on Thursday Microsoft did not announce how much many had been spent on the takeover .
beam launched its programme in January , and already has more than 100,000 users .

here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany 's speeders will have to get used to the new generation of speedometers : in various federal states , including Hesse and Brandenburg , new speed cameras are being trialled , which are supposed to be particularly effective at catching those who drive too fast .
the futuristic @ - @ looking enforcement trailer made by Vitronic , a company form Wiesbaden , could be used at accident blackspots , for example , where it is too dangerous for the police to go .
for example , roadworks on a motorway , or a bridge that is due to be repaired , and therefore has a temporary speed limit often lack the infrastructure to support a fixed speed camera to ensure that speed limits are being adhered to .
it can also be too dangerous or expensive to keep assembling and unassembling the speed camera at these points .
the enforcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts for five days of continuous measurement , and data is transferred in encrypted form via a modem .
thanks to laser measuring technology , all vehicles across several lanes can be tracked at the same time .
variable speed limits and driving bans based on time , lane or vehicle type can also be monitored .
when powered up , the manufacturer says that any car with a trailer coupling can move the trailer .
to prevent it from simply being stolen , it sinks down when measuring , making its wheels disappear into the armoured , bullet @ - @ proof exterior .
in addition , the speed camera 's in @ - @ built alarm system is designed to protect it from vandalism .
since 2015 , according to Vitronic , the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used in them .
foreign authorities are also using the new technology for speed cameras : recently France ordered 100 of them , after ordering 150 the year before .
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
great Britain 's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43 @ - @ 7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling , off @ - @ loading , side @ - @ stepping , support play , running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
defeat came with the non @ - @ too shabby consolation of silver - Britain 's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa along the way .
the bruising beating of the boks , 7 @ - @ 5 in the semi @ - @ final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
but , regardless , Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15 @ - @ man team .
it may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fiji 's head coach is Ben Ryan , the former England boss from Wimbledon .
it has been some journey for GB .
eight years ago , under Ryan , they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens .
here , they lost just one .
this hammering will hurt but the progress is startling .
Fiji started magnificently , bouncing off GB tackles for fun .
it was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5 @ - @ 0 up when osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner .
with four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12 @ - @ 0 and GB had hardly touched the ball .
a superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man @ - @ mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji .
on seven minutes jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17 @ - @ 0 to the bad .
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score .
the conversion made it 29 @ - @ 0 at the break .
it was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s , while GB are still learning the trade .
which is pretty much how it is .
GB made wholesale changes at half @ - @ time and they plugged the Fijian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first @ - @ half standards was good , until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay .
dan Norton grabbed a try for GB , touching down in the left corner to make it 36 @ - @ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was hard not to admire Fiji 's whole joyful approach .
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn ' t need icing with another try in the dying moments .
the whistle went , the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf , thoroughly beaten .
earlier in the day , Fiji had beaten Japan 20 @ - @ 5 in their semi @ - @ final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi @ - @ final of one try each - Britain 's conversion the difference .
Kyle Brown put the boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson , brother of England 's 15 @ - @ aside team , Anthony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal .
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach 's cancer battle
there will not be a more emotive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 punishing heaves into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa .
though they were the two pulling on the oars , there were three voices in that boat , the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women 's pairs , the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height .
their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don ' t it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it alters your outlook a bit .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft , 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that 's how it starts off .
rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams , who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties .
Stanning , a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her , said " I 've been an emotional wreck this week , maybe that 's a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . "
it just reiterates how much this means to me , how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well .
it 's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he 's the best coach in the world .
I couldn ' t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven ' t lost a race in five years .
the pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
Helen was calling ' stay in the process , stay in the process ' .
it 's really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren ' t looking to do anything amazing .
we weren ' t looking for fireworks today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their futures .
Glover has a wedding to attend next month , her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn ' t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , " she said .
setting a clear example for 31 years
the Managing Director of the " Veitensteingruppe " Water Supply Association , Rupert Göller , is retiring .
the Assocation " sets an example for the entirety of Bavaria . "
a small Franconian drinking water supply association as a role @ - @ model for the large water producers .
that was how the association was described in a segment on Bavarian radio .
a little later , the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia praised the Association .
the Veitensteingruppe 's work was described as " setting an example for the entirety of Bavaria . "
Rupert Göller is behind it all : he worked as an employee of the Association for 31 years , and has been its Managing Director for 28 .
he has now gone into retirement at the age of 65 .
the Veitensteingruppe Drinking Water Supply Association has its headquarters in Kottendorf in the commune of Breitbrunn , and provides 150,000 cubic metres of water annually , supplying 32 villages and hamlets with around 5,500 inhabitants .
the communes of Kirchlauter , Breitbrunn , Lauter , Ebelsbach and the municipality of Baunach are also members .
water supply contracts are in place for additional municipalities and communes .
current chairman , Breitbrunn 's mayoress Gertrud Bühl ( FW ) , looks back to when Ruper Göller was brought on as a water officer in 1985 , and was promoted to Managing Director of the Association as soon as 1988 .
" his tasks were very varied , ranging from constructing water pipes and performing maintenance work through to office and organisational tasks , budget planning , calculating fees and contributions , through to getting involved in emergencies at weekends , " the chairman said .
she pointed out some exceptional successes , including commissioning and opening the new spring ( 1994 ) , purchasing land near the new spring ( 1998 ) , compensating farmers , renovating the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , creating a new computer management system ( 2004 ) , and renewing some of the water pipes .
things never stopped , and renovations were always underway : water means life , and drinking water is the most important foodstuff of all .
in her laudatory speech , she praised Göller 's loyal , reliable , and upstanding service over 31 years .
he put his heart and soul into the Water Supply Association , and lived for it as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he gave a presentation at the Water Forum for the District of Lower Franconia as a true practitioner of the Veitensteingruppe 's successful nitrate reduction concept .
he received considerable appreciation and praise for this .
for his part , Rupert Göller praised water officer Alfons Griebel , who had worked alongside him for 28 years .
he is the best water officer , and he was a loyal lad .
together , we were an unbeatable team .
from his perspective , the high point was the construction of the spring and the restructuring of the Association .
however , the largest challenge and most difficult shift was when the pipe broke on the Kirchlauter elevated tank on 3 January one year .
we had to work through the night at minus 17 degrees to ensure the locality would be supplied with water .
even the supply from the new spring was sometimes only maintained because the elevated tank at Pettstadt was filled by hosepipe .
the management of the Drinking Water Supply Association was passed to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter , who will be Rupert Göller 's successor .
soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago 's autism - and addresses other parents affected by the disease : " you must be brave enough to talk about it . "
" medicine has come a long way , " the 44 @ - @ year @ - @ old said to Italian newspaper " Corriere della Sera . "
when her son was diagnosed with the disease , she thought she would die .
Tiago is now eight years old and has made great strides , being schooled privately in New York , where the best therapists are located .
" to give an example : if I ask him what happened two years ago when I sang at Milan 's La Scala , he can ' t remember anything , " Netrebko said .
but he is the happiest person on earth .
Tiago is the offspring of Netrebko 's liaison with bass @ - @ baritone Erwin Schrott .
she is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov .
crime passionelle in Bargteheide - man shoots his partner
a 35 @ - @ year @ - @ old man shot and fatally wounded his partner on Friday around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargeteheide ( in the district of Stormarn ) .
" the man himself called up and admitted to having shot his partner , " a police spokeswoman said .
the perpetrator is on the run , she said , and he is officially being sought .
this search is now happening across Germany , because Sven S. might be travelling by car .
the man is around 1.8 m tall , muscular , sun @ - @ tanned , and has a bald patch .
the police have now issued a photo of him .
but it is a couple of years old .
the man now has a bald patch .
the man should not be approached .
the police believe he may still be carrying a weapon .
anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110 .
the police are talking of a " crime passionelle . "
the victim was apparently born in 1988 , the perpetrator in 1981 .
the police force in Lübeck dealing with the crime initially did not want to disclose any information on the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim , but it confirmed that a person had been killed .
" it is a homicide . "
" we are not saying any more at this time , " a police spokeswoman in Lübeck said .
according to eyewitnesses , a SWAT team was at the scene .
steel - There 's a ray of hope for the German steel industry
the German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared additional costs that could have run into the millions .
the sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green energy , but these are now off the table .
Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) told the " Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung " ( WAZ ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self @ - @ supply for pre @ - @ existing plants within the German steel industry .
" I am truly delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations . "
the European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers , who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use , pay a levy .
according to the German association for the sector , the steel industry was threatened with additional costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel told WAZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission , following discussions with Margrethe Vestager , the Commissioner for Competition .
the EEG levy of 20 percent is now only due when the generators in the steelworks are replaced .
this too will not be levied against the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement Germany had reached with the EU Commission on electricity self @ - @ generation .
the agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formalised .
Gabriel 's positive efforts are particularly important for the steel industry .
" it is the first step within our " steel is the future " campaign . "
" this needs to be followed by other steps . "
" climate targets and employment objectives also need to be taken into account during negotiations to reform emissions allowances , " explained IG Metall 's CEO , Jörg Hofmann , in Frankfurt .
since the financial crisis of 2008 , Europe 's steel sector has suffered from overcapacities and considerable pressure in terms of pricing .
the situation only worsened over the past year when the world ' biggest producer , China , dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand .
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel firms of price dumping .
the situation improved slightly during spring of this year .
on the one hand , import taxes started to have an impact on imported steel , on the other , economic prospects in China brightened up .
it is not clear how long prices will remain perked up for .
the German sector leader , Thyssenkrupp , was cautious on Thursday .
prices had plateaued recently , he said .
the sector is reacting to the tricky situation by reducing prices further .
ThyssenKrupp also did not want to rule out closing individual plants .
at the end of 2015 , around 86,000 people were employed in Germany 's steel industry .
despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July .
at 3.4 million tons , they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year , as the steel association reported on Friday .
after a brief spike in May , the amounts produced shrunk for a second consecutive month .
since the start of the year , production has been two percent less than the value for the equivalent period in the previous year .
the association is expecting output to increase over the next few months thanks to an improved situation in terms of orders .
Community , mind , health : singing is good for the elderly
singing has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp 's entire life : as a young girl she sang in her school choir , when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes , and today , the 78 @ - @ year @ - @ old sings in a choir for the elderly .
" singing moves me - emotionally and physically , " she describes .
after a rehearsal , she feels balanced , happy , and generally more alive , she says .
and additionally , she 's doing something good for her health and her mind .
singing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reasons , says Erhard Hackler from the German Association for the Elderly .
most elderly people sing in a choir and share the enjoyment they get from music with like @ - @ minded people , says Hackler .
by regularly spending time with others , the elderly can build and maintain social contacts .
social and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people .
Ursel Kipp has also experienced this in her choir : " arranging and organising things with people , being able to rely on others and learn from them - a choir is a really unique way of being together with other people . "
singing can be demanding in the positive sense , Hackler thinks .
this is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a controlled manner .
if you push your lungs to their limits regularly , you will not run out of breath as quickly in day @ - @ to @ - @ day life .
and if you are interested in keeping the sound of your voice as you age , too , singing is the perfect hobby .
singing often has a really special effect on older people , says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of Senior Citizens ' Associations .
for older generations , singing together is seen as more important , it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time , she explains .
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in older people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth .
song texts , and melodies in particular , can even be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past .
singing also demands particular mental exertion , explains Lenz .
concentrating on one 's own voice and a set rhythm , while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge .
in particular , older people who live alone can practice how to focus on people other than themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in a choir , Hackler thinks .
a happy audience is great praise .
even one 's self @ - @ esteem is boosted by singing in a choir .
being able to show yourself that by practising for a long time , you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength .
so there are enough good reasons to start singing .
if you want to try a new hobby , don ' t delay - even if you think you 've not got much talent , Lenz suggests .
you 're not singing by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing , who 'll hear if a note 's out here or there ?
the elderly have many options when looking for the right fit , says Hackler .
if someone you know already sings in a choir for the elderly , you can just go along with them .
in addition , many towns offer an overview of the choirs in their region .
if you want to sing in a church choir , you can approach the parish or churchwarden directly .
many choirs for the elderly can also be found online .
if you don ' t have access to the internet , you can ask your family , friends or neighbours to help you look things up online .
if you 're interested in singing , you should absolutely join a choir , Hackler thinks .
singing is good for the soul and is a kind of release - no matter how old you are .
female cats react more sensitively than male cats to the mewls of their kittens
biologists in Hanover have researched the effect kittens ' cries have on adult animals .
to their surprise , the miaowing didn ' t leave the male cats unaffected - but , compared to their female counterparts , they always acted the same way .
female cats can tell how agitated kittens are by their miaowing .
they react ten percent quicker to kittens who sound to be in great distress , the scientists from the Veterinary University and Medical University of Hanover discovered .
male cats do respond to kittens ' cries - but always to the same extent .
" it is clear that the acoustic differences between the miaows of kittens that are more or less agitaged are either imperceptible or unimportant for male cats , " the biologists Wiebke Konerding , from MHH , said .
she is the first author of the study published in the " BMC Evolutionary Biology " specialist journal this Friday .
in a previous experiment the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of a kitten 's miaow changes depending on how urgently they need help .
nine adult male cats and eight female cats from the MHH 's animal husbandry programme were examined .
firstly , they were played the sound of a kitten who had been taken from the birthing box and separated from its mother and siblings for three minutes .
then they were played the sound of a more agitated cat , which had also been lifted up .
despite the low sample size , the researchers believe the results to be significant .
" all females , even those who did not have their offspring , were able to differentiate between miaows , " said Konerding .
they turned towards the speaker quicker if it was playing the sound of a highly agitated kitten .
this ability may be innate , or may develop as the animal reaches sexual maturity .
" one surprise was that the male cats reacted at all , " the biologist said .
in the past , scientists have researched women 's and men 's reactions to babies ' cries on multiple occasions .
even in this field a few studies showed that woman reacted more sensitively to infants , regardless of whether they had their own children or not , the biologist Marina Scheumann reported .
Podolski and " Gala " are shooting for the Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey for the former football star Hakan Sükür .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation .
an important football match is taking place in Turkey for the first time following the attempted coup .
ahead of the duel between arch @ - @ rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski 's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya , the official line is clear : " business as usual . "
even when announcing the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July , the government emphasised that this would not affect citizens ' daily life .
this does not apply to those people suspected of being followers of the imam Fethulla Gülen , who is believed to be responsible for the attempted coup .
and this doesn ' t stop for football .
the state prosecutor has issued a warrant for the arrest of former star striker Hakan Sükür .
Sükür , who now lives in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation .
Sükür is accused of being a follower of the imam Fethullah Gülen , whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan holds responsible for the attempted coup .
while the state of emergency , declared for ninety days , will continue until October , it is having practically no effect on the lives of most Turks .
on Wednesday , Erdogan announced that the night @ - @ time " democracy vigils " in public places across the country have come to an end .
the sport - like the entire country - is divided into those who support Erdogan , and those who do not .
fans of the workers ' club Besiktas , in particular , are not traditionally counted among the President 's friends .
however , the strict rejection of military coups is what brings most Turks together , in the light of dramatic historical events .
and even the fans can agree on that - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas .
for cup winners Gala , it will once again depend on Lukas Podolski .
the Cologne native has proved his sporting value over the last season : with 17 goals and nine assists across all competitions , the 31 @ - @ year @ - @ old closed his first season as his club 's top scorer .
in the final game against Fenerbahce , he scored the goal that led to a 1 @ - @ 0 victory .
the " fanatik " newspaper praised him , saying " he was the best player on the pitch . "
he finished the season in style , and secured the cup for his team .
thanks to " Poldi , " the disappointing season for the record @ - @ holders came to a happy end .
after their knockout in the heats for the Champions League , the " Lions " also left the Europa League early on .
they only reached sixth place in the Süper Lig .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only chance to win something .
" we did it - and that 's the most important thing , " said Podolski .
winners Besiktas saw a better year of play .
this is mainly thanks to Mario Gomez , who laid the groundwork for their fourteenth title with 26 matches in the season as the Süper Lig 's star goalkeeper .
this is also why fans are hoping that the 31 @ - @ year @ - @ old returns .
Gomez , under contract at AC Florenz and only on loan to Besktas , announced after the attempted coup that he would not return to the country after his European Championship holiday due to the political situation .
" but if Mario wants to come here , all he has to do is say , " " Kicker " specialist magazine quoted club chairman Fikret Orman as saying .
however , the star would have to be prepared to give up around a third of his annual salary , estimated at 7.5 million euros , as Orman made clear : " we can not pay the salary that Florenz do . "
despite doping : these athletes are still in with a chance of winning medals in Rio
Justin Gatlin , aged 34 , has already been banned twice for doping ( in 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is banned from taking her place on the start line .
other track athletes who have been found guilty can only laugh - they are in Rio competing for medals .
the issue of doping continues to hit the headlines during the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa , who appealed against her doping conviction shortly before the games to enable herself to compete , was booed and shouted at as she started her 100 @ - @ metre breaststroke race .
it was a bizarre scene : she waltzed into the pool with a smile plastered on her face , a deliberately provocative entrance .
as it became clear that she would not take the gold medal , the audience cheered enthusiastically .
but there are many other athletes preparing to line up on the start line at the Olympic Games in Rio despite having been involved in doping in the past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gatlin ( 100 , 200 , 4x100m relay / USA ) : the 34 @ - @ year @ - @ old is one of the most controversial track athletes .
he has already been banned twice for doping ( in 2001 and from 2006 to 2010 ) .
since being banned , the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion is running faster than ever before : covering 100m in 9.80 seconds , he is the world number one , and is Usain Bolt 's major challenger .
Shelly @ - @ Ann Fraser @ - @ Pryce ( 100 , 4x100m relay / Jamaica ) : the two @ - @ time Olympic champion and seven @ - @ time World Champion was handed a six @ - @ month ban in 2010 after she was proved to have taken oxycodone .
the 29 @ - @ year @ - @ old defended herself by saying she had suffered with bad toothache after an operation .
Sandra Perkovic ( discus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Chamption , 2013 World Champion and 2010 @ - @ 2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methyhexaminine .
Perkovic said that she had not knowingly taken the drug , and was banned for six months .
this year 's four longest throws were by the woman tipped for gold .
LaShawn Merrit ( 200 , 400 4x400m relay / USA ) : champion at the Beijing Olympics and two @ - @ time 400m World Champion , Merrit tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months .
Merritt claimed that a penis enlargement drug was to blame .
this year , the 30 @ - @ year @ - @ old is the fastest man in the world in the 200m and the 400m .
Ivan Tichon ( hammer , Belarus ) : there is hardly another athlete who has been retrospectively stripped of so many medals .
Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after he was proved to have been involved in testosterone doping .
now 40 years old , he was also stripped of his 2004 Olympic silver medal for doping with steroids , and his 2006 European Champion title for testosterone misuse .
his bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics was also taken away , but it was returned to him following a decision by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport , CAS .
with 80.04 m he is at second place in the global rankings .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record holder and favourite to win gold tested positive as far back as May , but will still be on the start line in Rio .
the 29 @ - @ year @ - @ old world champion revealed traces of a banned dietary supplement , but the World Anti @ - @ Doping Agency ( WADA ) ' s ban was lenient , and ended as early as July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - One Austrian woman injured - Several dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , Thomas Schnöll , the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry , said early on Friday morning .
she has some cuts , he says , and was treated in hospital , but has already been able to leave hospital .
she plans to return home at the start of September .
it is currently unclear whether other Austrian citizens have been affected by the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket or in the southern cities of Surat Thani , Phang Nga , Trang and Chumpon .
according to Schnöll , the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities as a result .
Hua Hin , located around 200 kilometres south of the capital city , Bangkok , two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday evening .
according to police reports , a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people injured , including the Austrian woman , three Germans , three people from Holland and three Italians .
there were another two explosions early on Friday morning , with another person killed , according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket early in the morning .
police reports state that a taxi driver was injured in the explosion , which occurred near Patong beach , popular with holidaymakers .
another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country 's south @ - @ east coast , which led to the death of a civil servant .
according to the authorities , the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police 's territory .
finally , explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the south @ - @ west coast and in Chumphon on the south @ - @ east coast caused several casualties .
there is apparently a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin .
" the bomb attacks bear the same signature , " said Army General Danai Kritmethavee to journalists early on Friday morning .
" we are assuming that the attacks were coordinated . "
it is too early to speculate on possible motives , he says - however , it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country .
however , the Thai police issued a statement that the attacks were not connected with the Islamist resistance movement or with global terrorism .
" it is just local sabotage , limited to particular areas and provinces , " said a spokesperson in Bangkok .
it is more reasonable to assume that the bombs were set off by opponents of the military junta currently ruling the country .
over the past few days , the authorities have received notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for .
it is still apparently unclear who is behind the attacks .
the police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security around important governmental buildings , along with airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and nightlife districts .
small @ - @ scale bombings are a frequent occurrence in Thailand , but they are rarely directed at tourists .
there is a palace in Hua Hin that was used by Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years .
after the recent bomb explosions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry has issued a recommendation on its homepage that Austrians follow the instructions from the Thai security agencies at all times .
the provinces of Narathiwat , Yala , Pattani and Songhkla , along with Preah Vihear and its surroundings , have been issued with a high security alert ( security level 3 ) .
after skirmishes between security forces and Muslim sectors of the population , people are advised against all but essential travel to these districts .
the rest of the country is on an increased security alert ( security level 2 ) .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday came just a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta .
this will give the military large @ - @ scale influence even in the years to come .
the Head of the junta , and Prime Minister , Prayut Chan @ - @ o @ - @ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos when the country was heading towards stability , an improved economic climate and tourism .
the military junta took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest , and believes that it has led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to quell the latent resistance brewing with Muslim rebels in the southern edges of the country .
more than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict so far .
a little under a year ago , 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bankok - the majority of whom were foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody attack in the country 's recent history .
the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has the right @ - @ wing " Identitäre Bewegung " movement in its sights .
after several regional authorities had done so , the body charged with protecting the constitution across Germany has also put the group on a watchlist .
" in terms of the " Identitäre Bewegung " movement , we can see clear indicators of efforts against the free , democratic order , " said Hans @ - @ Georg Maaßen , head of constitutional protection , to the German press agency in Berlin .
Muslim migrants or migrants from the Middle East were vilified in an extremist manner .
that is why we will also be monitoring the movement from henceforth .
the " Identitäre Bewegung " is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it fights against " multicultural madness , " " uncontrolled mass immigration " and " the loss of national identity through foreigners . "
bodies protecting the constitution across nine federal states - Bremen , Bavarian , Hesse , Berlin , Baden @ - @ Württemberg , North Rhine @ - @ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - already have the " Identitäre " under observation .
Maaßen said that his authority had worked closely with regional authorities to come to its decision .
" groups such as the " Identitäre Bewegung " are trying to approach their target group on their level , " said the head of constitutional protection .
in general , extremists attempt to speak to them in young people 's own language , often with pop music .
radical Islamists and right @ - @ wing extremists both do this .
it 's not calm advertisement for the actual matter at hand .
this propaganda is designed to provoke an emotional response in people .
young people are particularly vulnerable to this .
this is dangerous .
recently , there have been reports from several federal states pointing out contact between members of the " Identitäre " movement and AfD politicians .
Maaßen said he had no information on this .
in terms of constitutional protection , potential contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain point , he says .
it depends on whether the party in question - in this case , the AfD - changes its focus and becomes extremist as a result of particular people who are extremists .
therefore , the decisive factor is whether these people exert a controlling influence over the party .
this has not been noted .
with regard to the clear increase in right @ - @ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters , Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of a new right @ - @ wing terrorism .
but , over the past few years , we have determined that right @ - @ wing terrorist structures can exist .
there was the " Old School Society " group or the " Freitaler Group . "
it can absolutely be the case that additional right @ - @ wing terrorist groups or small gatherings come to exist , and plan attacks on asylum seekers , refugee shelters , or for other far @ - @ right motives .
however , there is no Germany @ - @ wide or Europe @ - @ wide control of far @ - @ right terrorism that we can discern .
the groups that have existed to date have arisen on a regional level or via social networks .
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had previously not been involved in the far @ - @ right scene .
that is frightening .
many of those suspected of carrying out the attacks on asylum centers were not viewed as criminals , politically motivated perpetrators or members of the far @ - @ right scene .
" this means that many people have committed crimes who previously paid the far @ - @ right no heed , who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU , SPD or the Left , who were then radicalised by far @ - @ right sensationalism . "
Rio 2016 : ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes an Internet sensation
Olympic athletes or world records aren ' t always the only things to hit the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this is shown by ROBEL Kiros Habte 's brave performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aquatics Centre , the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that , sometimes , it was impossible to see him in the televised images .
he just disappeared - no matter how wide a perspective was used .
Habte finally become a viral internet sensation on social networks .
the 24 @ - @ year @ - @ old completed his heat 48 seconds slower than the next @ - @ fastest competitor , taking place 59 out of 59 .
however , it was his not @ - @ quite sporty figure that caught the eye of the international media .
why was the 24 @ - @ year @ - @ old taking part in the Olympic games ?
the Ethiopian was given special permission to take part by the international swimming federation .
this is given out to popularise swimming in underrepresented countries .
because most athletes from Ethiopia run , Habte wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : ROBEL Kiros Habte prepared himself for the big race .
the first nicknames were soon doing the rounds .
some media outlets dubbed him " ROBEL the whale . "
with reference to his " flabby stomach , " the British tabloid " The Sun " mocked his " Dad Bod . "
his time , almost one minute and five seconds for the 100 metre freestyle , played no part in this .
comparisons were also made with " Eric the Eel . "
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Moussambani 's race also drew media attention .
the performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable : he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own .
Moussambani was then greeted by wild cheering .
he was 22 years old at the time , and had learnt to swim eight months before the Olympics - and had never managed such a long distance before the competition began .

Trump is not taking the threat of election defeat too seriously
the Republican candidate for the presidency , Donald Trump , spoke out at an election event in Florida .
if things don ' t work out with the presidential election , Donald Trump already has a plan B in place .
he would go on holiday .
Donald Trump wouldn ' t really mind if he lost the US presidential election in November : " either it 'll work out , or I 'll go on a long , long holiday , " the Republican candidate said in an telephone interview with US television channel CNBC .
if he doesn ' t make it because of political correctness , that 's ok , Trump said .
for example , he called US President Barack Obama , and the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton , the founders of terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , resistance continues to grow .
the postal service gets on board with electric vehicles
Detusche Post 's electric truck in action .
other companies are clearly interested in the vehicle .
the postal service is also planning to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle .
soon the company will start retailing the vehicle .
the postal service wants to bring its electric vehicle to the free automotive market from next year .
" we want to start selling it to third parties , " a postal service spokesman said on Friday .
for months the company has been examining whether the StreetScooter it developed , which is used to deliver letters and parcels , could be sold to other sectors as well .
managing Director of the postal service Jürgen Gerdes said that there was always demand from tradesmen .
according to information in " Der Spiegel , " a news magazine , the Bonn @ - @ based company will soon start mass production of the vehicle .
the company is planning to use its own factories to build up to 10,000 vehicles per year , per level .
Gerdes announced that the company wanted to increase the size of its fleet of electric cars considerably , and that its long @ - @ term aim was to switch over completely to these environmentally friendly vehicles .
" we will take a very , very strong step towards 2020 , " he said at the end of July .
I can imagine that we will switch over the entire fleet .
the StreetScooter has been out and about on Germany 's roads since 2014 .
GfK managing director steps down after disappointing figures
consumer research firm GfK is replacing its managing director Matthias Hartmann .
his resignation came swiftly - but it was not a complete surprise .
the tricky situation in which market research firm GfK finds itself made it self @ - @ evident that Managing Director Matthias Harmann 's seat became more and more unstable the longer the success he promised failed to materialise .
turbulence at the top of Nuremberg 's market research firm GfK : after another round of disappointing figures and the resignation of the managing director , the firm , fifth in its sector globally , is on the brink of a personal new start .
GfK 's managing director wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the managing director of GfK 's supervisory board , Arno Mahlert , has already announced that he will be leaving the supervisory committee with effect from 12 September .
the company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger , who is currently a member of the board of directors , will take over the management of the board on 1 September .
officially , he will take on the role of " board spokesman " until Hartmann 's successor has been found .
the company cited " different viewpoints " on long @ - @ term business direction as the reason behind the resignation .
a company spokesman did not give further details on Friday .
it is currently not clear who will head up the market research firm in the future .
in investment circles , on Friday it was said that shareholders were greatly disappointed by the lack of success following the restructuring programme implemented years ago .
Mr Hartman has headed up GfK since 2011 .
" the benefits of the restructuring programme will only become visible after 5 years , " he said .
as a result of GfK 's recent poor figures , every shareholder would be a little unsettled , he said .
" if that were the case at BMW , the quants would be too , " he said .
after suffering losses in the previous quarters , the company was unable to stop losing money in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 361.2 million euros , turnover was 6.1 lower than it had been in the same quarter of the previous year .
compared to the first six months of the year , turnover ( 721.2 million euros ) had shrunk by 3.4 percent .
the company 's reduced value because of the difficult economic climate had impacted second @ - @ quarter profits , in particular .
the goodwill amortisation of 139 million euros required for the consumer experience sector was provided by the company , leading to a final loss of 148.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , GfK had made a profit of 19.7 million .
incident - Bus slips into a ditch in Krummhörn : eight people injured
on Thursday , an accident involving a coach carrying 43 elderly people in Krummhörn ( district of Aurich ) led to eight people being injured .
two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , the police reported .
the 66 @ - @ year @ - @ old bus driver , employed by a coach company based in Eisenach , said that she had to swerve to avoid an oncoming lorry that was partly on the wrong side of the road .
the bus came off the right @ - @ hand side of the road , and skidded into a ditch , a spokeswoman for the police force of Aurich / Wittmund reported .
" as a result of the way the bus was positioned , people were not able to leave the bus on their own , " she said .
the fire brigade freed the passengers .
six rescue vehicles and an ambulance were in attendance at the scene of the accident on the no. 2 road .
uninjured passengers were transported back to Krummhörn 's Pewsum district by regular bus .
they waited there until a replacement bus was sent by the coach company .
investigators are asking the lorry driver and any witnesses to make themselves known to the police .
from 1 October 2016 , fees per cubic metre of sewage for the area covered by the sewage plant at Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl will be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros as previously , 3.36 euros ( previously 2.26 euros ) for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp , and 3.64 euros ( previously 2.18 euros ) for Azendorf .
the sewage fee for the sewage works in Azendorf will be raised again if it is necessary to carry out improvement works .
according to an estimated calculation , sewage fees in Azendorf will then come to 4.37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser ( CSU ) reported , when the district administration of Kulmbach approved the budget , it was determined that these sewage plants were underfunded .
the market town of Kasendorf is legally obliged to run the sewage works so that they break even .
from 1 October 2016 , individuals and commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl , Neudorf , Reuth , Azendorf , Lopp , Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig a little deeper .
the fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent .
as administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , it was necessary to recalculate the fees for the sewage plants serving the market town .
between October 2016 and September 2020 , overfunding and underfunding from the previous calculation period will be balanced out .
Schmidt justifies the major fee increases by saying that all three sewage plants are relatively small and deal with a very small amount of waste , namely between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres a pear .
as a result of the low distribution , expenses for critical repairs amounting to several thousand euros , for example , seem major .
in addition , the amount of sewage arriving at all three plants is gradually decreasing .
furthermore , the previous calculation period did not include renovation and repair works to a great extent for all three treatment plants , not least because of their age .
the plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants in Welschenkahl , Neudorf and Reuth , as well as Zultenberg , Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the waste treatment plant at Azendorf needed to have its mechanical ventilation system replaced because of damage .
the conveyor system in the pumping station at Welschenkahl is almost 20 years old , and needs to be completely overhauled ; the first clarification pond in the pond treatment plant at Lopp has been operational for almost 20 years and now needs to be dredged , its sewage sludge removed , and an additional ventilation system incorporated to ensure that it will be in line with water law regulations in the future .
Schmidt : " these extraordinary expenses were also coupled with perpetual support and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . "
the same is true for electricity costs : in the previous calculations for 2011 / 2012 , they are far below their current levels .
Steinhäuser pointed out that , even with a low amount of sewage coming to the three plants , the expenses for running and maintaining them " were significantly impacted . "
as a result , Schmidt expanded , the market town had been saved from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years .
from Steinhäuser 's perspective , the plants mentioned will remain in a precarious situation in the long run , especially as the area covered by Friesenbachtal wastewater association can not be expanded to include these plants because they are running at a deficit .
Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months

the annual average inflation , measured by CPI , in the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was -0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) has been -0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 % .

Snapchat " Anime " Effect Is criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime , but some observers say it 's racially insensitive .
with its lens tool , Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
the lenses are blunt , feature @ - @ warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day .
any missteps quickly enter the public record .
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty .
so when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes , distorted teeth and puffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - " yellowface . "
and they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday , with reports by The Verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant as homage to anime characters , not as a caricature of Asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action .
others roundly rejected the anime comparison .
in an email , Grace Sparapani , a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared , said that the lens was " hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least . "
she added that " it 's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter 's effects .
it shows that the filter isn ' t just yellowface , but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires .
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
and Snapchat 's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snapchat 's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user , 25 @ - @ year @ - @ old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday , " it 's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before . "
on Thursday , Ms. Zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race @ - @ related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat .
Ms. Zhu criticized the company 's mostly white , all @ - @ male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
" it 's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they 're able to make decisions like this , " Ms. Zhu , who is Chinese @ - @ American , said , " or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they 're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . "
other observers share her view , a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
for her part , Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed , adding , " I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O. K. "
military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence , Congressional Panel Says
officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted , a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee , Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , found " widespread dissatisfaction " among Central Command intelligence analysts , who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State .
central Command , known as Centcom , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Fla . , that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia .
" intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U. S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , " a news release about the report said .
" what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , " said Representative Ken Calvert , Republican of California .
the leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization .
the 10 @ - @ page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command 's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
" throughout the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events , " the report said .
for example , a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mosul , Iraq 's second @ - @ largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
" after months of investigation , this much is very clear , " Representative Mike Pompeo , Republican of Kansas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the United States Central Command 's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command 's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq .
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated .
the report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general .
democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force .
" between 2014 and 2015 , Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces , " Representative Adam B. Schiff , the committee 's top Democrat , said in a statement .
this process , Mr. Schiff said , " stalled the release of intelligence products , " hurt morale among analysts and " insufficiently accommodated dissenting views . "
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a " preset or political narrative . "
the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast .
last August , The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation , opened after complaints by Centcom analysts .
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general 's investigation continued .
but he said that " experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . "
the investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American @ - @ led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials ) .
but last year 's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis spots .
the critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a Centcom intelligence analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush , over many analysts " objections , advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence .
last year , officials said , Mr. Hooker 's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , airstrikes against Islamic State @ - @ held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group 's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside Central Command , The Times reported in September .
Centcom 's commander then , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .
U. S. Wins 4th Straight in Women 's Field Hockey , Setting Up Showdown With Britain
one day after scoring three goals in a 6 @ - @ 1 victory over Japan , Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women 's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India , 3 @ - @ 0 .
five goals in two games should be a memorable feat , but Bam , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
" I have no clue , " she said .
I 'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the Americans are 4 @ - @ 0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain , which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan , 2 @ - @ 0 , on Thursday .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six @ - @ team bracket and who finishes second .
the first @ - @ place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch , the leaders of the other bracket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however Saturday 's game turns out , the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games .
BAM was on that team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pa . , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youngest player ever .
she missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her teammates .
the next year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , was named the coach , and things began to change .
" a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , " Bam said .
we didn ' t have the work rate in London that we have now .
we 've made a complete turnaround .
on Thursday night , Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in .
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1 @ - @ 0 until late in the third period , when Bam took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @ - @ 0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period .
the shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie , Jackie Briggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
she is on a roll .
so is Bam .
" we 're in a good place right now , " Parnham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday 's game .
amid the Fury of the Olympics , the Zen of the Trampoline
wherever you are , whatever time it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable , a furious relay of competition and striving .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton , passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete .
you can ' t turn on a television , read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor 's conversation in a coffee @ - @ shop line without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
and then there is Logan Dooley .
Mr. Dooley , a first @ - @ time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making , may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time , buoyed by sponsorships and feel @ - @ good TV commercials , if he were a swimmer , a gymnast or even a fencer .
but Mr. Dooley , 28 , of Lake Forest , Calif . , is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally .
further from the center , partly in shadow , are those sports not universally acknowledged : air @ - @ pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we will always have the breaststroke , and long may it reign .
but if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite , let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it debuted at the Sydney Games , it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all .
this may be a regional ignorance .
despite sending athletes to compete , the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men , and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women .
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year .
but there is an underdog charm to trampoline , in part because it sounds , to the unenlightened ear , fitter for clown college than the Olympics .
here I should confess that I am no expert , just an earthbound enthusiast .
it does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never @ - @ ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , the two sports it essentially combines .
the word " trampoline " derives from the Spanish el trampolín , meaning " diving board . "
aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline , shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air , and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves ( twists , pikes and somersaults ) before eventually landing on their feet .
they are judged on execution , difficulty and " flight time , " according to the official Olympic program .
thirty @ - @ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
medal hopefuls must go farther , faster , up and over , in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , other times back and forth up and down the court .
they are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also , in the televised coverage , another taunting line : that of the world , or Olympic , record .
this single @ - @ minded pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears .
but it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games .
from this , trampoline offers a respite .
the trampoliner 's vector is up .
forward motion is not the goal .
he or she rebounds , seeming weightless as an astronaut , going up , then down , then effortlessly up again .
it is not without competition , of course , nor without difficulty , but for the duration of a routine , there is no frantic charge toward the end , no vaulting into the distance , just the dreamy , graceful suspension of time and gravity .
it is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets .
the women 's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time ; the men 's on Saturday , also at 1 .
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days .
in the midst of Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , lovely moment , one likely to be overlooked in the general melee .
and if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men 's gymnasts recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base .
" a Generation Is protesting " in Ethiopia , Long a U. S. Ally
violent Protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police .
is Ethiopia about to crack ?
for the last decade , it has been one Africa 's most stable nations , a solid Western ally with a fast @ - @ growing economy .
but in recent months , anti @ - @ government protests have convulsed the country , spreading into more and more areas .
in the last week alone , thousands of people stormed into the streets , demanding fundamental political change .
the government response , according to human rights groups , was ruthless .
witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators .
videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall .
the top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation .
" it was always difficult holding this country together , and moving forward , it will be even harder , " said Rashid Abdi , the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa , after Nigeria , and its stability is cherished by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in Somalia , and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid .
Ethiopia 's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip .
its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital , Addis Ababa .
and its streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government 's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dissidents effectively silenced .
many have been exiled , jailed , killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert .
but that may be changing .
" if you suffocate people and they don ' t have any other options but to protest , it breaks out , " said Seyoum Teshome , a university lecturer in central Ethiopia .
the whole youth is protesting .
a generation is protesting .
the complaints are many , covering everything from land use to the governing coalition 's stranglehold on power .
after a widely criticized election last year , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle along that jagged , disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years , like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front , may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm .
several factors explain why bitter feelings , after years of simmering beneath the surface , are exploding now .
the first is seemingly innocuous : smartphones .
only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved .
even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter , as it frequently does , especially during protests , many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are .
several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests .
second , there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas , Ethiopia 's two largest ethnic groups .
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies .
for eons , Amharas from Ethiopia 's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business , exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas .
but that is changing as well .
" we are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella , " said Mulatu Gemechu , an Oromo leader .
the biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas .
many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military , the intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi .
Mr. Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia 's prime minister for 17 years , until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could see around corners .
analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents .
" the current regime lacks that ground savvy , " Mr. Abdi , the conflict analyst , said .
Ethiopia 's new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles 's shoes .
unlike Mr. Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner .
analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan @ - @ controlled security services .
the result , many fear , is more bloodshed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005 , after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole .
in the ensuing crackdown , many protesters were killed , though fewer than in recent months , and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
development experts have praised Ethiopia 's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , and measurable strides in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia 's government from intensifying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , protesters in Gondar , an Amhara town , attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans , and anti @ - @ Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position .
the American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble .
" that , " Mr. Abdi said , " is a very tight rope to walk . "
Donald Trump Explains His Obama @ - @ Founded @ - @ ISIS Claim as " sarcasm "
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the " founders " of the Islamic State terrorist group .
the clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee 's ability to communicate clearly to the American public .
it also put his surrogates , who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch , in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean .
after making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night , Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early @ - @ morning Twitter post on Friday , Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic .
the post was a reversal from just a day ago , when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican presidential nominee would not have it .
the latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton 's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before .
in late July , after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton 's emails , he later explained his remarks by saying , " Of course I 'm being sarcastic . "
the approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed .
" I think it 's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans , seeing how they play , and then " clarifying " one way or another depending on the reaction , " said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates .
but I also think he 's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses .
instead of toning things down for a general election audience , Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble .
a new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina , Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida .
while Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says , he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor .
but as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign , Mr. Trump 's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump 's most prominent surrogates , went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday .
" I think what he 's saying there is legitimate , political commentary , " Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump 's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State .
it is true in a sense that before Obama , ISIS was an almost unknown , small little organization , he who called it the jayvee , totally wrong , and here 's why it happened , because he withdrew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state , allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East .
ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him .
he mocked the " poor , pathetic " television pundits who try to figure him out and said , " They can ' t ! "
some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump 's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president .
once Priced Out , a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
verb Cafe was a shabby , cash @ - @ only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi @ - @ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
naturally , it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront .
the store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014 , Soap Cherie , sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes .
locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city .
the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , " New York is change , I know , but still , can ' t believe CBGB 's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop . "
but if New York is change , it is also reinvention .
a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of the original location .
the new Verb has Wi @ - @ Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe .
the coffee is still good , too .
leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place .
he started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost , he said he was excited to do it .
Mr. Rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine .
it even reused the lights from the old Verb .
but Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
bacon @ - @ egg @ - @ and @ - @ cheese sandwiches are on the menu , and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available .
there are brown @ - @ rice bowls .
the cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices .
nine months in , Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars .
" a lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too , " he said .
on a recent Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer .
Ms. Oliveira , 34 , used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently .
even after she moved to Greenpoint , she would still make the trek .
after Verb closed , she said , she gave up drinking coffee for a while .
" I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked , " she said .
now she 's back on coffee , although that day , instead of her usual iced coffee , she went with a blended chai drink , another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal , another longtime customer , went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003 .
he 'd go before work and order the same thing without fail .
" quarter past seven , every day , like clockwork , I 'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter , " he said .
photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu .
these days , Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order , but sometimes he 'll switch things up with the bacon , egg and cheese on an everything bagel .
Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space .
in fact , the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb , using the cafe 's cold @ - @ brewed coffee as an ingredient .
" I think we still might take them up on it , " Mr. Rodriguez said .
and Greenpoint 's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well .
one of these new customers translated the menu into Polish , and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome .
the new location has other perks .
a local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold @ - @ brewed coffee .
there is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough .
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed .
when the new space opened , Mr. Whitt said , walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming .
" I 've needed to smell that , " he said .
the depressing Food of the Depression , in " A Square Meal "
in March 1933 , shortly after ascending to the presidency , Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office .
a gourmand , President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup .
his menu that day was more humble : deviled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and , for dessert , prune pudding .
" it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering , " Jane Ziegelman said .
her husband , Andrew Coe , added , " It was also a message to Americans about how to eat . "
the couple , who live in Brooklyn Heights , are food historians .
Mr. Coe 's last book , " Chop Suey , " was about Chinese cuisine in America , while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book " 97 Orchard . "
their new , collaborative work , " A Square Meal , " which will be published Tuesday by Harper , is a history of American food in the Great Depression .
showing some culinary solidarity of their own , they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg 's Sandwich Shop , a tiny no @ - @ frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
Ms. Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich , while Mr. Coe , 57 , had the turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable medley .
when a reporter ordered meatloaf , the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression @ - @ era eating .
" loaves were very popular , " Ms. Ziegelman said .
there was peanut loaf , liver loaf , bean loaf .
they were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out .
imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner .
Mr. Coe grimaced .
" it must have sat in your stomach like lead , " he said .
in the years before the Depression , the American table , especially in rural areas , was an all @ - @ you @ - @ can @ - @ eat buffet .
teams of women cooked for male farmworkers , and fresh @ - @ baked pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. " A Square Meal " chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
" this was a time when food became a central , fraught subject for the American people , " Mr. Coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally fraught was the new budget diet : mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples , the casserole a " wonderful way to repurpose leftovers , " Ms. Ziegelman noted , because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , for years the center of the American meal , became a sparingly apportioned luxury .
strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense .
in researching the book , which includes recipes , Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter .
" it was not a popular addition to the dinner table , " Mr. Coe said .
Ms. Ziegelman amplified : " it was surreal . "
peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion .
it was characteristic of a lot of the home @ - @ ec recipes .
as never before or since , home economists - among them Louise Stanley , chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country 's eating habits .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become " budgeteers " and rise to the challenge of transforming Glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes .
" a Square Meal " is a feast of historical tidbits .
especially savory are the accounts of the government 's response to its hungry citizenry , like President Herbert Hoover 's let @ - @ me @ - @ eat @ - @ cake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood , he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become .
" he liked to eat Continental cuisine , like fish with cucumber sauce , " Mr. Coe said .
he ate in almost a gold @ - @ plated dining room , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was fabulously out of touch .
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , Eleanor , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach .
as the book tells it , Mrs. Roosevelt 's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that " put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared . "
many of the Depression @ - @ era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition , Ms. Ziegelman said , and on the way science has been applied to cooking .
the couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman 's mother - how she couldn ' t throw food away , for instance .
" she had a real fear of food waste , " Mr. Coe said .
Ms. Ziegelman recalled : " she actually got people sick . "
there was the cream @ - @ puff incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eisenberg 's , she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
" it 's called prune whip , " Ms. Ziegelman said , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name .
there was no whipped cream , just prunes , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo .
surprisingly , it wasn ' t bad .
Mr. Coe went back for seconds , and thirds .
sounding like a can @ - @ do budgeter , he told his wife , " Some chopped walnuts would help . "
killed in a bomb attack : he was the hero of Aleppo
he put his own life at risk to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Aleppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the Syrian people .
he risked everything to save other people 's lives .
now the 30 @ - @ year @ - @ old has been killed in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the " White Helmets , " a civil protection group which , according to Bild newspaper , had saved the lives of 60,000 people .
2,900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people from bombed @ - @ out houses and perform first @ - @ aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protection volunteer showing him during an 11 @ - @ hour operation to rescue an infant from the ruins of a house went viral in 2014 .
it made the Syrian a glowing figurehead amidst the horror of the war .
however , he never saw himself as a hero , saying , according to Bild : " for me , this is the real jihad . "
" if I were to die saving lives , I would think that God saw me as a martyr . "
shortly before Omar himself became a victim of an attack , he had spoken in a video about the recent bomb attacks on Syria .
helicopters had released four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district , one of which was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children were killed , and seven people have been left with breathing difficulties .
" we are now clearing away the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don ' t play with it , " quoted Bild as his last words before he died .
the fatal bomb dropped by the Assad regime was supposed to have been aimed at terrorists .
the Greenland shark : the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
it 's a rare sight .
Greenland sharks generally only come to the surface in winter .
after being examined on board the research ship " Sanna , " this shark was returned to the sea .
it was born in 1624 and has swum through the North Atlantic at 1 km / h right through to the present day .
Greenland sharks only give birth to young at the age of 150 .
Greenland sharks swim leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic , covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour .
the five @ - @ metre @ - @ long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km / h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal .
however , this slow pace of life seems to be the key to a long life .
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues wrote an article in " Science , " the specialist journal , about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old .
" it 's crazy , " says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock about this lifespan - which is a world record for a vertebrate .
it is true that evolutionary biologists had long thought that Greenland sharks had been around for a very long time .
they were simply lacking the proof .
it is hard to observe Greenland sharks , namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Svalbard .
they generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius .
as a result , researchers know little about how Greenland sharks live .
their slow speed was measured by researchers off Svalbard , who fitted six animals with a tracker .
however , these sharks still manage to catch prey : in one animal 's stomach , researchers found the remains of a seal ; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear .
it may be the case that they hunt down sleeping animals , or patrol on the ocean floor and look out for corpses that have sunk downwards from higher levels of water .
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks caught in the depths of the North Atlantic by fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off the coast of Greenland or Svalbard .
the smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long , while the largest measured 502 centimetres .
they use carbon @ - @ 14 dating on the shark 's lens core to determine the shark 's age .
this core of the eye 's lens comes into being even before the shark is born , and the proteins in it are not renewed subsequently .
the two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon @ - @ 14 in their lens cores .
consequently , they were likely born after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons experiments released large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
by contrast , the lens cores of third @ - @ smallest animal , at 220 centimetres long , contained less of a surplus of carbon @ - @ 14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012 , it must have already had its 50th birthday .
by contrast , all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon @ - @ 14 in their lens cores , which comes from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @ - @ 14 monitor gave a 493 @ - @ centimetre @ - @ long Greenland shark an age of 335 , while the record @ - @ holding shark , at 502 centimetres , was apparently 392 years old .
it was already known that female Greenland sharks first had offspring when they were more than four metres long .
now researchers have been able to map this length onto an age .
as one of the animals , 392 centimetres long , was likely on the threshold of sexual maturity , and had an age of 156 , it seems that Greenland sharks take at least 150 years to be able to reproduce .
this is also a world record for vertebrates .
it is not by chance that such Methuselahs predominantly live in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @ - @ year @ - @ old Greenland whale , in whose neck a 120 @ - @ year @ - @ old harpoon tip was lodged , was caught off Alaska .
as a result of low temperatures , the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible .
this means they mature later - and age slower .
the animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters .
this is because their volume increases much quicker than their surface area , through which the animal radiates heat .
this means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is much bigger than that lost per gram of an elephant .
another advantage is that they have fewer enemies .
" this means that a smaller animal has a more dangerous life , and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible , " explains Scheuerlein , an evolutionary biologist .
by contrast , a very large animal can invest its resources in having a longer life .
construction sites coming as a TwinPack
the commune 's council focused on construction @ - @ related topics in its most recent session .
the committee was pleased to hear mayor Robert Putz ' announcement that " we can finally begin to market the residential construction sites that have recently been marked out . "
after plot , parcelling and accessibility questions had been answered , and applications for measurements had been made , there was nothing standing in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas of " Straßlweg " and " Schönau @ - @ West " ( near Binderstraße - development section 1 ) to interested parties .
the communal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural , peaceful residential commune of Schönau will attract young families and older people alike .
as said , people prepared to build on these sites should apply in the town hall from now , and the communal council will probably discuss giving out the plots in its September meeting .
so that it would be able to answer questions on the movement of additional businesses , in connection with the creation of jobs , the communal council decided to amend the space usage plan first re @ - @ drawn in spring of this year .
consequently , the business area already marked out in Unterzeitlarn will be expanded to include a further two plots near state road 2112 .
Frankfurt will benefit from Brexit
the city on the river Main will soon have the best chance against the competition of Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London .
" it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote , " said Michael Voigtländer , Head of IW 's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area .
after the Brexit referendum it is unclear whether financial institutions will still be allowed to run European financial business from London .
registration in the UK is all that has been required to date for the " EU passport . "
this is generally used by large US banks .
several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs .
the " Frankfurt Main Finance " lobbying group expects to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years .
according to the IW , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) ' s headquarters , responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone , all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt , along with further important authorities , such as EIOPA , Europe 's insurance regulator , and ESRB , the risk board .
while Paris has the headquarters of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
" the proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can communicate directly with the authorities , " says IW 's Professor Voigtländer .
while Luxembourg is home to a large funds industry , like Dublin , its infrastructure lets it down .
thanks to its large airport , Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to .
in addition , the city 's easily available business properties are a win .
" in Paris it 's not all that easy to find vacant high @ - @ quality offices , " said Voigtländer .
rents for top @ - @ class business properties are 50 % higher on the banks of the Seine than on the banks of the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt can offer better quality of life than its competitors , thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure , and low crime levels .
in a table compiled by management consultants Mercer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxembourg 19th , Dublin 33rd and Paris 37 th .
and even if quality of life is a matter of preference : " thanks to its already strong position as a financial hub for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could be able to attract additional banks and investors , " IW concluded .
despite the Brexit vote , London will remain Europe 's financial capital , according to the economic researchers .
this is also to do with strength ratios : according to figures from regional bank Helaba , around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt .
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc , a U. S. district judge has ruled .
in June , Gilead was freed from paying up $ 200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead 's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni , after a U. S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices .
in a filing on Thursday , U. S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead , which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in Gilead 's drugs .
U. S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U. S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left , a spokesman for the group said on Friday .

Clintons earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 , paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent .
in 2015 , the Clintons made $ 1 million in charitable contributions , mostly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $ 5.3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department .
Clinton 's running mate , U. S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , along with his wife , Anne Holton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015 .
" Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , " Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement .
in stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is customary for U. S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
Trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
" your move , " Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter , linking to the Democratic nominee 's returns .
on Thursday , Trump 's special counsel , Michael Cohen , told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete .
Trump 's critics , including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his charitable contributions , his business dealings and various other ties , including with Russia .
Clinton has pounced on the issue , releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high @ - @ profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes .
on Thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan .
" he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , " she told the crowd .
politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case .
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal .
at a Clinton rally last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there , challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is " afraid " not of the tax @ - @ collection agency but of voters .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the Clintons , who now live in Chappaqua , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent .
the Clintons ' 2015 return showed that , unlike most Americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low @ - @ cost index mutual fund , and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $ 109,000 .

chilli @ - @ powder condoms , firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them .
the method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation , which hit upon the idea several years ago , with U. S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion , training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non @ - @ violent four @ - @ step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals .
previously many used spears to defend themselves .
Friday is World Elephant Day , which is dedicated to the protection of the animals .
" since we developed the ... toolkit , we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants , " Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement .
the first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn .
if it is not deterred , a so @ - @ called " chilli cloud " is thrown .
chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom , its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed .
when lit , the condom bursts open with a bang , spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air .
one whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way .
a last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air , producing a loud , bright explosion .
municipal council reaches unanimous decision : no new kiosk to be built on the St. Goarer bank of the Rhine
normally the people of St. Goarer are happy to accept investment from businesses - but retail in the core of the city is clearly capable of developing itself .
the municipal has now unanimously rejected the application to build a new retail kiosk on the bank of the river Rhine close to the Rhine balcony currently under construction .
" we are generally happy to welcome new businesses , but this kiosk does not fit in this exposed position on the bank of the Rhine , " explained Michael Hubrath on behalf of the CDU faction .
Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab " request " - RT News
a French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel 's dial code , with employee citing " requests " from Arabic customers .
Claude Lanzmann , an author of Holocaust documentary " Shoah , " vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ .
during his recent stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and eradicated ?
Lanzmann wrote .
instead , Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center .
seeking explanation , the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel 's reception .
the answer he got there , Lanzmann wrote " shocked him . "
the hotel 's clerk said that the measure was " a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski @ - @ Hotels . "
the reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker .
" the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel 's code to be deleted , " the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas @ - @ Handelsman called the case a " great shame , " Suddeutsche Zeitung reports .
we were appalled and shocked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disgrace .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , " the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply " caved in " to the alleged demands of Arabic customers .
" shame on you , " another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue .
the hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations , calling what happened an " oversight " and " apologizing " to Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reports .
" there was never a direct order " not to include Israel in the fast dial list , " Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .
police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans .
under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country 's senate voted for her impeachment .
trade between Russia & Iran surges 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year @ - @ on @ - @ year terms , according to Russia 's ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzhagaryan .
since international sanctions against Iran were lifted , there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , " Dzhagaryan said .
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million .
in particular , Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery , ground vehicles and weapons , " the ambassador said .
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year .
last year , the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas , mostly travel , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia .
it 's safe to say that last year 's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken , " he said .
at the same time , relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
" I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , " he said .
witnesses wanted : drinks cash @ - @ and @ - @ carry in Waldbröl raided
a robbery took place on Thursday evening in the drinks cash @ - @ and @ - @ carry of Rewe XXL on Walbröl 's Gerberstraße .
three people dressed in dark clothing and with their faces covered brandished a gun and demanded that staff at the cash @ - @ and @ - @ carry hand over cash . they made a run for it on foot , and then probably got into a silver VW Golf .
the police did not report how much money had been stolen .
between 1.6 and 1.7 m tall , the perpetrators were relatively short .
the drinks cash @ - @ and @ - @ carry can be accessed directly from the Rewe supermarket 's car park , and is tricky to observe .
after the robbery , the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße along Friedrich @ - @ Engelbert @ - @ Weg , and then fled , possibly towards the B 256 ( Schladern ring road ) in the silver car from the Schotterparkplatz opposite the entrance to the multi @ - @ storey car park .
anyone who saw anything around the time of the crime ( around 7.45 p.m. ) that is connected with the robbery should contact the police immediately .

Haigerloch : pilgrims at the gates of mercy
the ministrants from the chaplaincy of Eyachtal @ - @ Haigerloch St. Anna went on a four @ - @ day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg .
they covered four stages together .
the committee of upper ministrants for St. Anna had decided to prepare for and go on a pilgrimage lasting several days to bridge the gap to the next pilgrimage to Rome for all ministrants , likely to take place in two years ' time .
various pilgrimage sites were discussed , and a decision was finally made to go to the bishop 's city of Freiburg , where , to mark the holy year of mercy , this year the gates of mercy opened for this at Freiburg cathedral are a particular pilgrimage site .
16 children from Bittelbronn , Gruol , Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off .
on the previous evening , Father Storost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims ' cross and the pilgrims .
they took the train from Horb to the starting point of Villingen , where the Cathedral of Our Lady is found . they started their pilgrimage from the cathedral .
the individual day trips were framed by brief moments every morning and evening with various prayers , songs and written texts .
even when they were out and about , the children took breaks at wayside crosses , chapels or churches to sing a song from the pilgrims ' songbook they had put together themselves .
the rectory of each parish they reached was available for them to stay in overnight .
at each stage , Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for creating a delicious , nourishing dinner and breakfast .
the second day saw them head towards Gütenbach , via Furtwangen .
the next day , they set off on the section towards St. Peter , the most demanding section , seeing them climb around 500 metres in altitude in sweltering heat , and then descend again .
they earned the reward of barbecueing together by the swimming pond .
after the morning session on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive cloisters of St. Peter , they started off on the final stage to Freiburg .
the children gathered together in Freiburg Cathedral late in the afternoon , visibly relieved and happy , and passed through the gates of mercy .
a brief moment was taken to thank God .
the evening mass in the cathedral saw the children who had arrived at the pilgrimage site welcomed by Chaplain Markus Obert .
after the service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristry and the high altar .
the next day , there was time to look around the city , located in the region of Breisgau .
in the afternoon they took the train back to Horb .
at the end , all the participants agreed that the trip was characterised by spirituality and a strong sense of camaraderie .
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland 's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men 's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012 .
the Glaswegian 23 @ - @ year @ - @ old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit .
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds .
and they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March 's Track World Championships in London , despite Hoy having since retired .
the issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff .
they did so just in time as Hindes emerged .
hoy 's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill .
Skinner was the man Britain 's coaches stuck with , seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised .
Hindes , Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying , but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the duel for gold .
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap , but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and , in particular , Skinner to keep pace .
hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium .
the 23 @ - @ year @ - @ old Skinner , from Glasgow , said : " it 's a flattering comparison . "
I 'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there 's no better way to win it .
after triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy , Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain 's rivals .
there was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
Hindes said : " it felt like London , with all the GB flags in the stand . "
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we 've been losing out on so many world titles , so to win the Olympics again is just amazing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits .
with the form Kenny demonstrated , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy 's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games .
that would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who is also born on 23 March ( that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as Hoy 's .
Kenny next competes in the sprint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28 @ - @ year @ - @ old from Bolton said : " I 'm just enjoying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your mates .
it 's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest .
Hindes said : " if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a knighthood . "
it was the day 's only medal event , but there was further good news for Britain .
Sir Bradley Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four @ - @ man , four @ - @ kilometres team pursuit .
they finished in 3 : 51.943 .
the world record , set in winning gold at London 2012 , is 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and final ( 10.42 pm ) take place on today 's second day of action , where Wiggins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride , when officials summoned him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women 's event , which resumes and concludes tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time , clocking 4 : 13.260 .
team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals .
after truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London , expectations have been played down in the lead @ - @ up to Rio .
there have been dramas in the background , not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations , and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
however , on the evidence of the first night 's racing in the velodrome , it looks like GB 's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
Portland smelter 's future in doubt with axing of power contract
the future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant 's owners is to terminate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be axed .
the move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20 @ - @ year fixed subsidy expires in November .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa 's Portland plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional knock @ - @ on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria 's entire electricity output .
in 2014 , Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant .
Alcoa 's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
AGL , which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , with China 's CITIC and Japan 's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares .
" AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue , " it said .
AGL said the contracts are so @ - @ called ' hedging contracts ' which were due to take effect from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @ - @ month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
" as such , AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , " the power company said .
any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 187 million in " anticipation of a termination event . "
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts " does not affect Alcoa 's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter . "
the US company said it entered into a 20 @ - @ year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , AGL 's head of operations , Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts .
if both of those plants go from the market that 's a significant reduction in demand in the [ electricity ] market .
and as a generator that wouldn ' t be good for us , " he said .
not just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall 's on the cover of September 's Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of mother @ - @ manager Kris 's Kardashian @ - @ Jenner clan , is on the cover of US Vogue 's coveted September issue .
Kendall , who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan , Paris and New York fashion weeks , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
" in a room with a bunch of people I love , looking at this cover made me cry , " Kendall wrote .
the cover revelation was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians @ - @ esque ? ) , scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian @ - @ Jenner family ( bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn , and joined by everyone 's favourite showbiz uncle , Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest ) forgetting about their sister 's cover , only to end with the classic twist : they were all planning a surprise party .
it 's the cliche plot line of nearly every " birthday " episode of a children 's television show ( Seacrest delivers the line , " You thought we forgot about you ? , " with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8 am timeslot ) , but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow .
because , with a spot on Vogue 's September issue , we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian .
Kendall 's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue ( she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014 ) , but the magazine 's September cover is a league unto itself .
the September Issue is Vogue 's highest selling edition of the year .
with a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers ( fashionista counted 615 of last year 's 832 @ - @ page tome as advertising content ) .
the revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that , in the past two years , pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement .
previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , the cover has certainly featured more " celebrities who model " than " models who are celebrities . "
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013 , the year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
but , even on the off @ - @ chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the " breakout model " of her generation - falls into the former category , she is in pretty good company .
these celebrities are not relatives of famous people , or reality stars , or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video ( although Jenner is all of these things ) .
they are legitimately talented women , excelling in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on last year 's cover , has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade .
of course , not everyone is pleased about Jenner 's success .
with her reality television history , Jenner 's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught .
in June , original Victoria 's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid , calling them the " bitches of the moment . "
this sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner 's Vogue cover appearance .
but dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue .
she is a supermodel , in the purest sense of the word .
she 's walking for Marc Jacobs .
she 's selling you Estee Lauder foundation .
she , and all of her sisters , are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps .
she 's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford 's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine .
and , in her downtime , possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids , she 's on reality television .
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the nation 's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already @ - @ stretched operations .
in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
Community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are bracing for further cuts .
from June next year , those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
" Queensland 's community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , " he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crippling debts , families going through separation , workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they 're not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the Attorney @ - @ General , and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they 're faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it 's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities , and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work .
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
new York : Donald Trump 's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February .
the incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software trainer for the state campaign .
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising " this was not going to happen . "
the director , Earl Phillip , " produced a pistol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and drove the barrel into Vincent 's knee cap , " Bordini said in the complaint .
after complaining to local and regional campaign leadership , Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip , according to the filing .
" guns don ' t have to fire to inflict damage , " Bordini said in the complaint .
the suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the " Second Amendment people " -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges .
Trump 's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn ' t advocating violence .
Bordini 's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision , and from Phillip for assault , battery and infliction of emotional distress .
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn ' t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful .
WCCB , a local news affiliate in Charlotte , reported Phillip recently left the campaign .
a call left at his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , wasn ' t immediately returned .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign .
the case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc . , 16 @ - @ CS @ - @ 14300 , General Court of Justice , Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwerin : poll ahead of regional elections : SPD and CDU lose out
ahead of the elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses are looming for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU .
these are the findings of a representative poll carried out by INSA , a polling institute , on behalf of " Bild " newspaper .
while the red @ - @ black ruling coalition in the north might just be able to continue in office , this will not be possible in Berlin , according to the poll .
however , the SPD was the strongest party in both states , with good chances of putting forward the head of the government .
in Mecklenburg @ - @ Vorpommern , the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent to 24 percent in five years .
according to the poll , this puts the party only slightly above the CDU , who had 23 percent .
the Left and the AfD will fight over third place .
the Left had 19 percent ( previously 18.4 percent ) , and , with 19 percent , the AfD could be in the regional parliament for the first time .
despite small losses ( from 8.7 percent to 6 percent ) , the Greens will return to Schwerin 's regional parliament .
the NPD and the FPD , with 3 percent each , will not be represented in the regional parliament .
according to the poll , the SPD would only receive 23 percent in Berlin 's elections to the House of Representatives ( 2011 elections : 28.3 percent ) .
the CDU would only take 18 percent , after having taken 23.4 percent .
this would put them behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.6 percent ) , but ahead of the Left , with 15 percent ( previously 11.7 percent ) .
the AfD would be represented in the House for the first time , with 14 percent .
with 5 percent , the FPD could hope to return , but the Pirates , by contrast , would miss out - unlike in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communicator : the first smartphone
email and the Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communicator was brought to market 20 years ago .
its successors have now conquered the world - but its manufacturer is in the midst of a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , and harder to hold .
indeed , it was quite bulky .
the in @ - @ built storage originally held eight megabytes - enough today for around two high @ - @ resolution selfies .
now , an iPhone holds at least 16 gigabytes .
the " Nokia 9000 Communicator " was released for sale exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone .
the device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros , even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet .
however , 20 years ago , the Communicator sparked a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had presented the product a couple of months previously at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover , billing it as " the office you can fit in your pocket . "
the new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then : it could send and receive SMS messages and emails , and could even be contacted by fax .
you could even access websites via a HTML browser , even though it was painfully slow .
there was a calculator , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the phone could be folded open like a laptop .
this revealed a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was fairly high : 2700 deutschmarks , around 1400 euros .
in 2015 , the average sale price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros .
in August 1996 , nobody had any idea that the Communicator heralded the start of the smartphone era .
today , everything has changed .
smartphones are a success story - even if the same can not be said for Nokia .
the mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up .
today the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nokia .
for many people today , being online all day , no matter where you are , is simply a fact of life .
in 2015 , there were around two billion smartphone users around the world .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone make up 555 million of them .
global sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros .
this is in addition to the flourishing businesses of innumerable app providers and telecommunications firms .
an entire industry has now sprung up around smartphones .
the decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007 , when the Apple CEO at the time , Steve Jobs , announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communicator - and everything could be accessed easily via touchscreen .
Apple 's triumphant march began , and the iPhone is still the company 's most important product today .
Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry , who used to dominate the market , lost out .
they eventually disappeared , and Blackberry had to fight for its existence .
Apple , and Asian providers such as Samsung , now hold sway .
20 years after their invention , smartphones are a fact of life .
nowadays , every German looks at their phone an average of 88 times a day .
" we all need to learn to put our phones down from time to time , " said Janina Kugel , Siemens HR Director .
being permanently contactable has become a blessing and a curse .
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attraction of Heathrow , just as it was with London 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
the Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow .
for our local communities alone we 'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great .
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage .
the doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it .
like the Olympics , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211bn in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK .
we have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £ 11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from T5 - voted the world 's best airport terminal five years in a row , to T2 , built in the middle of the world 's busiest two runways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of .
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus , Facebook in " cat @ - @ and @ - @ mouse game " over ad blocking
for companies that make money from online advertising , attempts to circumvent ad @ - @ blocking software amount to a " cat @ - @ and @ - @ mouse game , " according to one of the companies that makes that software .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site , Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again .
on Tuesday , Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads .
but Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes .
in a blog post , Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that " this sort of back @ - @ and @ - @ forth battle between the open source ad @ - @ blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented , " and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon .
the fact that the world 's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry .
globally , roughly 200 million people use ad blockers , according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe ; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices , mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook 's advertising revenue .
the company is going after ad blockers on desktop however , because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook 's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram , a spokesperson said .
desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on Tuesday , Facebook said it would be updating its " ad preferences " tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock 's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non @ - @ advertising content on the site .
" this isn ' t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , " a Facebook spokesperson said in an e @ - @ mailed statement .
ad blockers are a blunt instrument , which is why we 've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people 's hands .
woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday .
a woman lay down in the dark on the road " in a desperate act " and was hit by several vehicles , Vaud police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a Swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lorry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a " logical " step in a situation like this , lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that 's what the prosecutor must determine , " said Hofstetter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists can not expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014 .
the 22 @ - @ year @ - @ old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a " completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , " the judge said .
anyone with information about Thursday 's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus ' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not Venus , with its hot , water @ - @ less surface and CO2 @ - @ chocked atmosphere , might have once hosted Earth @ - @ like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that Venus ' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin , Earth @ - @ like atmosphere and still spun slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of early Venus .
the planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer .
" in the GISS model 's simulation , Venus ' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time , " GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release .
this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating .
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth 's today .
the model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists .
though likely once habitable , Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light .
as its hydrogen escaped , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus , the Venus we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team 's decision @ - @ making process .
Colorado executive vice president / general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
" for the past three years , I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy , passion and determination , " the 50 @ - @ year @ - @ old Roy said in the statement .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and VP @ - @ hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team 's performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
Sakic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked Roy for his contributions to the team .
" Patrick informed me of his decision today , " Sakic said .
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league 's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013 @ - @ 14 .
he guided the club to 112 points and a first @ - @ place finish in the Central Division , but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
the Avalanche posted a 39 @ - @ 39 @ - @ 4 mark in 2015 @ - @ 16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild @ - @ card spot in the Western Conference .
a Hall of Fame goaltender , Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche .
North Sea oil workers resume talks , suspend strike
labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negotiators said .
strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
" wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute , " a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full @ - @ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
the company 's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
shell , for its part , has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega @ - @ merger with British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation .
the North Sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
" in the North Sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , " he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
the latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation .
" we hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star 's mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , " Luisa Rebull , a research scientist at Caltech 's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , said in a news release .
the Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light @ - @ years from Earth .
many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood , having been born roughly 125 million years ago .
they 're spinning as fast as they ever will .
at their peak spin rates , these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind .
as these winds travel across the stars ' magnetic fields , they enact a braking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures each star 's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots .
the latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull likens the stars to dancers , larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones .
" in the ' ballet ' of the Pleiades , we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars , " said Rebull .
because the Pleiades cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates .
" the Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions , younger and older , " said Rebull .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their ' dance shoes , ' so to speak .
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal .
a controversial baseball star steps down
Alex Rodriguez ' tears ran quicker than the US baseball star had run from base to base , in better days .
after his emotional announcement of retirement , the 41 @ - @ year @ - @ old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on 12 August , against the Tampa Bay Rays .
" I love this game and this team . "
" I 'm saying goodbye to both of them , " the 14 @ - @ time All Star Major League Baseball ( MLB ) player explained .
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees .
he signed a ten @ - @ year contract , which has brought him 27 million US dollars every year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will work as a consultant and a youth coach - on full pay .
Rodriguez paid this back in terms of playing performance long ago .
with 696 home runs , 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( " runs " ) , for the Seattle Mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 , the Yankees , he has reached rather a few milestones .
along with Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays , there are only two other baseball players who can boast similar key statistics .
however , the 41 @ - @ year @ - @ old can not be welcomed into the baseball Hall of Fame .
because no matter how successful Rodriguez - nicknamed " A @ - @ Rod " - was on the pitch , his behaviour off the pitch was just as controversial .
as far back as 2009 the superstar told ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the " biogenesis scandal . "
Rodriguez was the main suspect accused of having received performance enhancing drugs via an anti @ - @ ageing clinic in Florida over a period of years .
after a legal battle , the ban was reduced to 162 matches .
" the league might even have done me a favour in 2014 - I 'd played for 20 years without a break , " Rodriguez said , summing things up .
even his final days didn ' t go off without a bang .
while many baseball legends take to the great stage over their last few games , Rodriguez had to sit on the sidelines .
" my job isn ' t about a retirement tour . "
" my job is about trying to win every game , " stated Yankees coach Joe Girardi .
nevertheless , Rodriguez , who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who has been rumoured to have been linked to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson , had the support of the fans of Yankees ' arch rivals , Boston Red Sox .
" we want A @ - @ Rod , " the fans sang as they were defeated 4 : 9 by Rodriguez ' team .
2016 Olympics : Chen Xinyi , Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
busted : after a sample tested positive for doping , weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - the 2016 Olympic Games have been overshadowed by the first official cases of doping .
one now @ - @ banned athlete had almost won a medal .
the first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition .
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi , 3000 @ - @ meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil , and have been excluded . just before the start of the athletics competition , which has not escaped criticism , this news comes at a bad time .
the Sunday before , Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide , which is used to mask drugs .
the international sport tribunal CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time that she had been banned from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @ - @ year @ - @ old had taken fourth place in the 100m Butterfly final - missing out on a bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds .
Chen was supposed to have taken part in the 50m Freestyle heats on Friday .
Chen applied to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) for a hearing and to have her B sample opened .
the national association is taking the instance " very seriously , and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations , " quoted Xinhua from a press release : " we will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision . "
for the first time in history , the CAS , not the IOC , is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople who test positive .
also overnight in Rio , the news about Danekowa 's positive test leaked out , and the 33 @ - @ year @ - @ old went on the offensive herself .
" I had three tests , all of which were negative , and my fourth test was positive , " which was " an unbelievable shock , " she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT .
she said she was innocent and that " the only explanation could be food supplements , " the athlete explained .
according to the report , the banned substance involved was the blood doping chemical EPO .
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution , and according to BNT , a B sample also tested postive .
Bulgaria 's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up immediately to criticise the athlete .
" I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions , " he said : " we Bulgarians are under observation , so many have already been banned . "
almost all the weightlifters from the nation , which has been plagued by doping , were not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case of " Adrian Zielinski " was announced : the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier , just like his brother .
both deny taking it , but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg .
ahead of the athletes ' start , the case of Danekowa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team , with one exception , for systematic doping , and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Rio .
in swimming , China 's earlier offence had caused heated disputes between the athletes themselves .
Camille Lacourt , from France , spoke out harshly against Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang .
" sun Yang 's pee is purple . "
" when I look at the podium for the 200m Freestyle , I want to throw up , " Lacourt said on French radio .
in addition , Sun was at the middle of an argument with Mack Horton , from Australia .
" I have no time and no respect for drug cheats , " he said .
sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014 , but only had to sit out for a three @ - @ month ban .
data theft : this is how perfidiously hackers extort ransom money
programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - with success .
according to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America , the UK and Germany by Malwarebytes , the malware defence specialists , 40 percent of the companies surveyed had fallen victim to one , two , or several attacks involving extortion software in the past twelve months .
in Germany , around 20 percent of the companies had already been targeted by a Ransomware attack .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid up the ransom demanded by the perpetrators so that they were able to use their systems and data that had been affected by the attack .
according to Malwarebytes ' observations , it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful in that domain , the ransom money they can demand is significantly higher than it would be for private users .
" we are currently seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly , " explains Malwarebytes ' CEO , Marcin Kleczynski , in an interview with " Die Welt " newspaper .
in 2008 , most malware programmes were still focused on sending out adverts .
then perpetrators discovered extortion software .
private users were initially the target , but the shift to corporate attacks took place terrifyingly quickly over the past few months .
Ransomware follows a simple pattern : once activated on a user 's computer , it seeks out files that have not been edited for a long time , like Word , Excel or database files , as well as image and video archives .
the Ransomware encrypts these files , and deletes the originals for good .
finally , the software presents the extortioner 's demands .
the victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of " Bitcoins , " a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files .
but while it 's a personal photo database that 's at play for private users , it 's sensitive customer data or project databases needed for the continuation of projects that are the focus for companies .
as a result , the damage from a Ransomware hit is greater .
22 percent of German companies affected reported that they had suffered a fall in turnover due to Ransomware , 13 percent had to cease trading entirely , and in one instance , people 's lives were put at risk .
in Germany , several hospitals have already fallen victim to attacks , and their patients were placed under serious threat as a result of the loss of medical records .
" we always tell victims not to pay up : that simply exacerbates the problem , " explains Kleczynski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up get their files back .
faced with operations coming to a standstill , it is hard for managers to say no to the perpetrators ' demands .
then again , the hackers know that , and do all they can to build up a good reputation .
a recent study saw security researchers from F @ - @ Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners . they came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do try to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money .
they explain to their victims via chat how to pay using Bitcoin , set up freely @ - @ accessible support websites , or decrypt sample files for free .
and while private individuals are targeted for sums of a few hundred euros , companies sometimes have to bargain hard and pay out five @ - @ figure sums to get their files back decrypted .
faced with the potentially high and relatively risk @ - @ free profits from Ransomware extortion , hackers are becoming more and more professional , splitting up their work , explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos : " an individual can write a Ransomware program within about a week . "
however , it is more likely that three or four people will be involved .
the programmers then sell their malware to the actual extortioners in the form of a set of software building blocks .
malware kits to date , including the malware itself , advice and additional tools , have been sold for a one @ - @ off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
" the kits include an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be constructed , and the appearance and branding can be changed , " says Wisniewski .
the extortioners then look out additional hackers to distribute the freshly prepared software between victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you just log into an underground forum , buy the set from a criminal , and task someone else with installing the software on as many PCs as possible .
there 's a payment made for every computer infected .
" normally , criminals then task spammers with distribution , " explains Wisniewski .
now , many companies are aware of the risks of Ransomware , and they are protecting their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies ' IT specialists in Maywarebytes ' survey relied on using file back @ - @ ups and scanner software to beat Ransomware .
as a result , perpetrators are already trying out new strategies .
" if simply encrypting files isn ' t enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted , the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive files instead , such as customer lists , or price calculations , " explains Malwarebytes ' CEO , Marcin Kleczynski .
this means that the risk potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of file .
in the future , perpetrators will be able to focus themselves on brand @ - @ new targets within the internet of things .
at the Defcon hacker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermostat connected to the internet .
in the midst of winter , many victims would pay a ransom to have their blocked heating turned back on .
in the future , if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory instead of someone 's heating , Ransomware could also be a issue in Industry 4.0 .
something for every situation
Honda HR @ - @ V is practical and perfect for everyday use
Honda wants to cram everything into the small HR @ - @ V : a bit of an SUV , a bit of a coupé , bundled up with the versatility of a minivan .
it seems a bit too much , but the HR @ - @ V , built on the same new platform as the new Jazz , does indeed prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use .
although the HR @ - @ V , at just 1.60 m tall , seems small , passengers in the front and the back have got plenty of room , it 's not a squeeze at all .
the materials used in the interior are well crafted , and have a pleasant appearance - just the surface of the dashboard lets the side down .
the HR @ - @ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space .
there isn ' t just a boot of 453 l with the seats up , and 1026 l with the seats down ; there are the " magic seats " too .
this is rather less magical than it sounds : the seats in the back can be flipped up like cinema seats to reveal additional loading space , measuring 1.24 m from floor to ceiling .
the boot is easy to load , but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 2008 , which is a comparable model .
the 1.6 l diesel engine we tested , with 88 kW / 120 horsepower accelerates the HR @ - @ V powerfully , thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm across a wide range of speeds .
however , it could certainly do its work a bit more quietly .
everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km was pleasing .
there is an additional motor : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 horsepower .
all @ - @ wheel drive is not available .
its handling is balanced , a good compromise between speed and comfort .
the steering could be a bit more direct , however .
in the top @ - @ flight " Executive " version , which we tested , the fittings leave nothing to be desired .
the safety systems include city emergency braking assistant ( functions up to a speed of 32 ) , collision warning system , and the lane departure warning system .
the collision warning system is irritating occasionally : when parking , it sees lots of obstacles as " approaching objects . "
the high @ - @ beam assistant system is very reliable .
and the intelligent speed regulator reacts to traffic signage , and reduces the vehicle 's speed if necessary .
however , full connectivity is only available for the top @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ range model : 7 inch touchscreen , satnav , app integration , and more .
there are two USB ports and a HDMI port under the armrest , which makes them rather tricky to access .
it costs around 29,000 euros for a top @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ range diesel model , which is fair .
if you don ' t want to invest quite that much , the petrol model is available from 20,000 euros , and diesel from 23,000 euros .
the motors comply with euro 6 emissions standards .
with the HR @ - @ V , Honda is offering a diverse car that is perfect for everyday driving .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger boarding bridge
an airline will not be liable for a passenger 's fall on a passenger boarding bridge .
this is because liability only applies for risks typical for aviation travel , the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf argued ( Az . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the claimant had broken a kneecap in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened anywhere - it was one of the ordinary risks of life , pronounced the court .
the airline did not have to pay the man any compensation .
when do organisers pay if illness strikes ?
travellers who fall ill will only get their money back when they return home if there is no doubt that their illness was caused by something within their hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of visitors can be proved to have suffered the same symptoms .
in this case , a family were stricken with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey .
they spent almost all their holiday in their room .
the holidaymakers blamed a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant , which they believed to have polluted the seawater .
the family took the opinion that the holiday was unsatisfactory - and took the organiser to court .
the claimants had no luck in court .
it was true that the waste treatment plant was suffering from a fault .
but the organiser only found out about this just before the claimants departed .
until that date , the organiser had to assume that the seawater was acceptable .
according to the judgement , the organiser had not violated its information obligation .
in addition , no contamination was found in water samples .
when several hotel guests fall ill - possibly by infecting each other - the court views this as a general life risk .
only 38 of 691 guests fell ill .
de Maizière said that many people were worried about further attacks following the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July .
he said that the state must react to the threat of terrorism with prudence and resolve .
one thing is for sure : our country will not react to the perpetrators ' violence with hatred and division .
we will not give the terrorists this victory .
if perpetrators have to leave the country quicker , that will boost security and increase the general public 's approval of refugee politics .
de Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented before the federal elections in 2017 .
he also announced that security services would receive more staff , to the tune of " a mid @ - @ four figure sum over several years . "
advertising for terrorism must be punishable once again .
video surveillance is to be improved , and gun laws to be amended so that purchasing weapons online , in particular , is made more difficult .
doctors ' confidentiality obligations , recently the subject of much discussion , are to remain , according to De Maizière .
however , he wants to talk to doctors to find solutions to reduce the risk to the general public with regard to mental illness , he said .
the Minister felt that improved social care was important to counteract the radicalisation of refugees .
teachers must be better trained for dealing with traumatised individuals .
de Maizière is planning to employ undercover agents to hunt down criminals in particular areas of the Internet ( the Dark Web ) .
SPD Head Gabriel said that " the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further . "
he said it was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism .
" that was a slap in the face for agitators in the CDU / CSU , " said Gabriel on Friday to the newspapers of the Funke media group .
de Maizière had previously turned down calls from the coalition for a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
he views an overarching ban of full veils as problematic under the constitution .
you can ' t ban everything you 're opposed to , and I 'm opposed to the wearing of the burka .
we can talk about the law with regard to traffic , or for witnesses appearing in court .
head of the Greens , Simone Peter , accused the Minister of wanting to use new anti @ - @ terror packages to create an air of energy and ability to act .
head of the Left , Bernd Riexinger , said that " smooth talking and tightening up residency laws are not going to make the people in this country any more safe . "
better flow of traffic on the motorway slip road
traffic jams are a regular occurrence on the bypass - here 's a photo from November .
but that is about to change : the right @ - @ hand turning lane is to be extended .
this is good news for all drivers stuck in rush @ - @ hour traffic on the bypass every evening as they drive onto the motorway slip road ( A43 ) .
next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the State roadworks Office will extendthe right @ - @ hand turning lane in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit from Weseler Straße by 700 metres .
this means that drivers will be able to feed in directly from Hammer Straße .
the major advantage is that traffic will split earlier , improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 51 .
the CDU fraction in the Münster ( West ) district administration came up with the idea to lengthen the exit .
the traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5 pm and 7 pm .
on weekdays , the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes even goes over it .
this is caused by the bottleneck on the B51 , just before the exit onto Weseler Straße .
from here , there is only a single lane of traffic over the motorway bridge .
the second lane was removed a good eighteen months ago .
the reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lanes , particularly the weight of heavy goods vehicles .
the relevant authorities can not say how long this bottleneck , and the associated rush @ - @ hour traffic , will last .
it 's going to be a matter of years : officially , the bridge will remain in use until 2034 .
the district authorities deliberately chose the less busy period of the school holidays for the extension of the right @ - @ hand turning lane , because it will cause delays .
traffic will be diverted past the construction site in a single lane on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural programme for schools
the international class from the forest school has been to see " The Invisible House " at the theatre .
the " NIMA 's " association and Young Theatre are now planning a musical project .
the " NIMA 's " association enables young people from a migrant or refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the " International Class " at the Kinderhaus forest school saw a performance of the award @ - @ winning play " The Invisible House " at the Young Theatre in Münster .
within the framework of the " Intercultural Journey " set up by NIMA 's , 19 pupils aged between 11 and 15 saw the play in the small house .
the association 's objective is to encourage cultural integration of young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds , and since the start of the year , it has offered schools with welcome classes with the chance to attend cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class arrived in Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , among others , and spoke little German .
thanks to the choreography , scenic images and video animations they were able to follow the plot regardless , according to the press release from Münster 's Young Theatre .
NIMA 's , founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel , and the Young Theatre , will work on a musical theatre project together over the next season .
from October to December , young people aged between 14 and 20 with and without a migrant and refugee background will have the chance to attend professionally @ - @ led courses for singing , dancing , acting , and music .
there are also plans for acting and theatrical language training for children and families .
the " Intercultural Journey " project continues .
as a result of the increase in the number of refugees , the association is expecting that many classes will want to take part .
rain replaces shooting stars : there is hope that the weather will improve
for people hoping to spot shooting stars in south @ - @ west Germany on Thursday night , the weather put paid to their plans - but all is not lost .
the President of the Observatory of Welzheim , Hans @ - @ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning that the clouds and rain overnight meant that conditions were not ideal for observing the celestial show .
we are pinning our hopes on Friday night .
the weather is supposed to be good , so we 'll definitely see lots of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are the Perseids : some of the quickest shooting stars , travelling at 216000 kilometres an hour .
their name refers to the fact that they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus , which is visible in the north @ - @ east .
silent night : tips to fight sleep disorders
in the evening your mind won ' t stop whirring , you lie awake for hours each night , and by the time morning comes , sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off .
this is anything but relaxing .
if you suffer from these issues , you 're in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders , and more than ten percent find that they often or always wake up not feeling refreshed .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves ?
there are various forms of sleep disorders , and they can have many causes , emphasises Hans @ - @ Günter Weeß , President of the German Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine .
what people generally understand by sleep disorders is insomnia : a problem with falling asleep and sleeping through the night .
many people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagenknecht , Member of the Board of the German Association of General practicioners , who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
biological , psychological or behavioural factors can be to blame , along with medication .
a sleep disorder is often a reflection of another illness .
" waking up very early is common with depression , in particular , " says Weeß .
and it can be the case that several factors have an impact on each other .
if you have a slipped disk , for example , you might find it hard to lie down , wake up every couple of hours , and start to grumble about everyday problems and worries , suggests Weeß as an example .
that causes tension , and it is impossible to sleep .
when should you see your doctor about sleep disorders ?
if , over the course of a month , you sleep poorly for at least three nights a week , and find that this impacts you during the day , you should see a doctor , advises Weeß .
they can impact in various different ways : you could be exhausted , tired , poorly rested , suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert , be irritable , have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches .
to be able to treat a sleep disorder , it is important to work out what is causing it .
behaviour changes , cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - with traditional sleeping tablets only being used in exceptional circumstances and for a maximum of two weeks - are all options for treatment .
there are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany , emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze , Head of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin .
as a result , you should first turn to your GP if you 're suffering with a sleep disorder , recommends Weeß .
your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to a sleep lab , and what happens there ?
doctors recommend an examination in a sleep lab for patients whose snoring disrupts their breathing , for people who feel abnormally sleepy during the day , for sleepwalkers , or if the cause of a sleep disorder can not be pinpointed , explains Fietze .
you don ' t have to prepare for the examination at all .
you should spend the day normally .
" just - please don ' t take an afternoon nap , " says Fietze .
after being cabled up , you head to bed at your normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , you wear a nasal cannula , a belt across your chest and a sensor on your finger .
in addition , a camera mounted on the ceiling records the sleeper .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems they are experiencing ?
there are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a better night 's sleep .
Weeß lists them : going to bed and getting up a regular times , not staying in bed too long , not sleeping during the day , not watching television to get to sleep , avoiding alcohol , and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away , and that 's not helpful at all .
what the jungle camp has got to do with missing swimming medals
former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at the Olympics .
in December 2014 he got his first gold medal at the Short Course Swimming Championships in Doha , while setting his first world record .
now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has come forward on Facebook to defend his ex @ - @ teammates from criticism .
" in a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle gets 150,000 euros , nobody should wonder why medals aren ' t being won , " the 26 @ - @ year @ - @ old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page .
the remuneration system in swimming is poor , but doping tests , on the other hand , are very good , he says .
this means that we can not compete with countries who pay a lot and that don ' t pay as much attention to doping , or even encourage it .
" I 'm not saying that we should stop our tests , " he went on to explain .
if he wanted to make a comeback , Deibler would have to register with the National Anti @ - @ Doping Agency for Germany ( NADA ) nine months before he started .
this is exactly how it should be with countries .
" if you don ' t submit to WADA / FINA checks a particular amount of time before the World Championships / Olympics , then you shouldn ' t be able to take part , " the Hamburg resident stated , who now runs an ice @ - @ cream parlour .
airport : a gang of luggage thieves are arrested
professional thieves at Dusseldorf airport
plain clothes officers from Dusseldorf 's police force managed to arrest two women and two men , aged between 50 and 61 , on Thursday .
the suspects had worked as a group to steal several bags and items of luggage .
around 9.30 p.m. civil servants in Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to the police from previous thefts .
the two men and two women had committed multiple crimes since mid @ - @ July , and had committed the offences as a group , dividing up their work in a particularly professional way .
the specialists from the 34th police inspectorate were able to prove that the thieves , who had travelled to Germany to commit the crimes , had committed four crimes .
they had made more than 15,000 euros as a result .
old buildings , a couple of little linden trees , and a few cobblestones among them : at first glance , Berlin @ - @ Friedrichshain 's Rigaer Straße doesn ' t look as if it 's one of the streets that the police consider to be among the most dangerous in the city .
if you walk along the street from east to west , you come across playgrounds , a freshly painted kindergarten and a health @ - @ food shop .
someone has spraypainted " horrid ! " on the facade of a house .
opposite a Lidl , due to be pulled down soon , construction is already underway : by 2017 , a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed .
articles on this " trendy district , " as the property company responsible has dubbed Friedrichshain , have been illustrated with pictures of burning cars over the past few weeks .
the reason for this is house 94 : at first , it was occupied by squatters , then the inhabitants had rental contracts , but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events .
Berlin 's Senator of the Interior Henkel had called multiple times since the start of the year for the police to take a hard line against the project that has made the area a " no @ - @ go zone " for police and singled out 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence .
after the rooms on the ground floor , the Kadterschmiede , were cleared on 22 June by 300 police officers , the police patrolled the area for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three vans , closing parts of the street and preventing visitors from accessing house 94 .
during this period , builders renovated the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house .
on 13 July Berlin 's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and , one day later , police and builders left the site , to the cheers of supporters and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street seemed peaceful : parents were out walking with their children , people were sitting on their houses ' steps in the sunshine , other people were chatting in front of the off @ - @ licence .
near the house project there is a primary school and a kindergarten .
far @ - @ left violence is not what worries most residents the most : Kerstin Neugebauer , who has lived in the district since 1999 , and Jana * , who has brought three children up here , are mainly irritated by the police presence .
they share the inhabitants of the housing project 's fears of rising rents and gentrification .
it doesn ' t sound like a district that wants more police protection against left @ - @ wing vandalism .
the schisms that Berlin 's Senator for the Interior and the police believe to have opened up between the squatters in the house and their neighbours do not exist .
Friedrichshain , in the east of Berlin , was traditionally a working @ - @ class neighbourhood . even today , it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city .
squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district : in 1990 numerous houses in the then @ - @ GDR were full of squatters , including almost all of Mainzer Straßer , near Rigauer .
while those on Mainzerstraße were cleared out during a real street battle with a large police deployment , many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised , and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become more and more of a magnet for tourists and Berlin residents who come from all over the world : residents from GDR times and former squatters are now sharing their district with them .
this can be felt in the rents , which have climbed by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in Rigauer are seen as symbols of this development : this is clear from their broken windows or freshly painted facades splattered by paint bombs .
no other street has been mentioned so often this year in connection with " autonomous left @ - @ wing violence . "
one reason for not all neighbours seeing this as a problem could be that they are not directly affected by crime : according to statistics , almost all crimes such as bodily harm are directed against the police .
the majority of crimes are damage to property , which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties .
for Kerstin Neugebauer , who has been living in a block of flats next @ - @ door to controversial number 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
she is calm about acts of violence : the people at number 94 are her neighbours , they certainly had nothing to do with it .
even the notorious burning cars have not played a role in Rigaer for a long time .
the trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite : " here we help each other , live together along the street , and talk to each other more than elsewhere . "
Neugebauer chose to move to Rigauer Straße - and she chose to stay there .
this is also why it was so important to her that residents got their street back : back from the police , politicians and the media who suddenly started claiming how important the district was in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer , the street is still being taken away : by impersonal new developments in old empty sites , which drive out old residents .
" they are freehold flats , and most people here aren ' t interested in that - people here generally aren ' t so well @ - @ off , " she said .
" I absolutely can not condone violence and destruction . "
but what should you do when nobody listens to you ?
then everyone gets frustrated , including the police and residents .
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who have moved in and are irritated by paint bombs : the housing project and the left @ - @ wing scene are part of the district .
if you move here , you should be aware of that - just like someone who moves into an area full of pubs should know they can ' t really complain about the noise .

Urbach : Annika Deutscle is the new Commissioner for Refugees
Annika Deutschle is the contact person for integration and organisation .
she will also work on @ - @ site as a social worker .
Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach since July .
the social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger .
she views herself as a point @ - @ of @ - @ contact for all involved : refugees , people from the working group for refugees , administrators , authorities , and anyone else .
Regine Kunde from the working group said that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now available to work as a jack @ - @ of @ - @ all @ - @ trades to help anyone experiencing difficulties .
that 's what some people said when management posted the advert for the job - meaning it less in a mocking way , and more with reference to the number of tasks that were to be performed .
they were looking for a manager with people skills and communication skills , combined with years of experience in social work - a real jack @ - @ of @ - @ all @ - @ trades .
however , managerial work is not how she spends most of her time , Annika Deuschle says .
it is primarily about organisation , working on @ - @ site with people , even in the background , and networking , she says .
the 31 @ - @ year @ - @ old has been in post for around six weeks .
she has taken the 50 % job for a fixed term of three years .
it was high time , " Regine Kunde said , that Annika Deuschle offered support to voluntary and full @ - @ time workers .
there are major problems , minor problems , organisational problems , problems with people , comprehension problems .
new containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße
for a while , one major problem has been finding homes subsequently for refugees that have been given certified status .
communes themselves are responsible for subsequent accommodation .
they have to house the refugees in their own properties or in rented properties .
communes themselves have to bear the costs for constructing , renting or renovating this accommodation .
responsibility switches from district administration to communes and job centres .
the problem : properties are free , but not every landlord is prepared to let .
the search has been very difficult for a while .
de facto , the administration can not find any private homes .
according to Deuschle , being reliant on private homes has not worked .
this is why the commune 's homes need to be beefed up , as it is so neatly put .
consequently new containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße .
but homes alone will not do the trick .
perspective is the key word , and Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree on that score .
in addition to a fixed abode , internships , apprenticeships , school places , " one @ - @ euro " traineeship jobs and temporary jobs need to be found or set up for refugees and migrants .
" more jobs would be good , " reports Regine Kunde .
many people work in builder 's yards or help caretakers , or do voluntary work - and that provides motivation in a very orderly way , as Annika Deuschle reports .
she hopes that working for the community leads to a positive public perception .
this is not " employment therapy . "
being active doesn ' t just mean working .
the day needs a fixed structure , Deuschle and Kunde say .
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
consequently there is a need to provide sports , contact to locals , and , above all , language courses .
professional courses are rare .
there is where the administration and volunteers can get involved .
she says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in Germany .
the length of time that processes take is a problem .
they have to explain to refugees that it will take that long , and that the time can be filled productively - for example , with language courses .
if someone feels that they can ' t help anyone in Urbach , that they aren ' t allowed to work , and that they are useless , they 'll never integrate .
the clear majority are motivated .
but there are also problem cases , Kunde says honestly , " people for whom nothing works . " as a result , Deuschle and Kunde 's work will always be to motivate others .
all told , this is " a mammoth task . "
a tricky question : after recent events , are the two women worried about radicalisation , even in a small commune like Urbach ?
" no , " Regine Kunde said clearly , " which some people might call naive . " she could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining .
however , volunteers are already aware of this .
these issues are already discussed by the refugees .
they were afraid that the attackers would bring them into total disrepute .
" they want to show they have nothing to do with it , " Regine Kunde said .
many of them would like to stay in Urbach .
so full @ - @ time and volunteer staff have to keep an eye open for jobs in the town and across the region .
but they always have in the back of their mind that a new group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Urbach .
does Germany need a cap ?
politicians shy away from answering this question .
it is unfair to show them volunteers on site .
" in Urbach we 've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet , " said Annika Deuschle .
the situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refugees .
Regine Kunde also makes clear that the residents of Urbach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date .
currently they amount to around 100 people , predominantly young men .
but when people are in need , you 've got to help them - and both women agree on that .
the political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers to be found there .
Schorndorf : search for intruders made by helicopter
the police helicopter flew above various areas for about an hour - without success .
two unknown men broke into an apartment in an apartment building in Lindenweg on Friday morning at around 8.50 am .
the residents surprised the two men , who fled .
the two men were between 1.65 m and 1.70 m tall , probably wearing masks , both wearing blue jeans and black hooded tops .
they were heading towards the centre of town .
the police launched several strip patrols and a police helicopter to try and find them .
without success .
it may be the case that the unknown assailants were recognised near the apartment or during their escape .
Baden @ - @ Württemberg : police launch investigation after bikers attack a snack bar

Returning to the American ideal of Labor Rights as Human Rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to establish the organization of unions as civil liberties .
" Like unions die , middle-class jobs die , " Ellison , a democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus , said in Congress .
So I pride myself , together with the civil-rights kone John Lewis , in putting forward the Labor Law .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces .
The addition of national labor laws to create a way to discriminate against workers to organize a union representative to sue justice in a civil court - and to receive compensation or punitive funds - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis , and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link them back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - Wisconsin , Michigan , and other countries around the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize , expand , and uphold labor rights .
There was a time when millions of Americans remember it when it called democracy , freedom of speech , press freedom , and unification in a breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged Japan to pass a constitution designed to ensure that democracy replaced the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos .
Knowing that workers and their unions were gaining a role in creating a new Japan , they used a language explicitly acknowledging that " the rights of workers to unite and to negotiate and act together . "
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism replaced Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy .
Recognizing that workers would have to organize and speak up in the new nation , the Germans added a clause explicitly : " The right to establish associations to ensure and improve working and economic conditions for individuals and every profession or enterprise .
Agreements limiting this right , or aiming to reduce it , are zero and non-existent ; aimed at action to do so is illegal .
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission , drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted as a global agreement in 1948 , Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that " everyone has the right to establish or share trade unions to advance its interests . "
For generations , Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
When that country debated how to shape civil and democratic societies , Americans declared that the right to establish a union -- and that union should then be protected as equal partners with corporations and government agencies -- must be protected .
Indeed , with these rights under fire in America , it is wise to rediscover the American ideal , according to which working people have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society .
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago :
History is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the labor movement , not restricted , enhanced the nation ’ s strength .
By raising the living standards of millions of people , labor miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
Those who attack work forget these simple truths , but the history preserves them .
History recalls , and we should .
Formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and extending civil rights protection to protect against discrimination in the creation of labor representatives - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy .
Judges stop temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana might be forced to close down .
A US federal judge preemptively stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday , which lawyers say was likely to close all five of the government ’ s abortion clinics .
That measure , adopted by Bobby Jindal , Governor of Louisiana , was enacted in June and enacted on September 1 , would force doctors who carry out abortions to acquire a patient breakout at a hospital of 30 miles to acquire their practice .
But the judge ’ s decision means that doctors can continue legal writing for now while demanding such a right .
" The plaintiffs can continue to work on the rule of law as they seek these rights , " German Justice John Gradeelles wrote in his judgment .
Within a month , a hearing is set for the judge to make the law a more durable decision .
Advocates of abortion applauded the recent decision in a series of judgments against similar measures , saying that doctors gained so much time to gain hospital assignment rights .
" Today 's decision means that the women of Louisiana will avoid a vexing law that wants to deprive them of health and rights , " said Nancy Northup , President , President , and Chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which had sued them in the name of three of the state 's five clinics to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and also requested admission rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional .
A central law in Texas , which would have forced most of the clinics left the state to close , was stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Advocates of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists , as well as the American Medical Association , are consistent in demanding unnecessary restrictions on admission rights for doctors .
Opponents of abortion counter that the measures are intended to protect women ’ s health , even though some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics .
Only one doctor who conducts abortions in Louisiana has patient entry rights , shared the center for reproductive rights .
If all other state doctors are forced to stop writing , the doctor , fearing for his safety , would no longer conduct the operation , said the group .
In arguing against the verdict , state officials told Louisiana that they would not punish doctors for writing abortions , while their claims on patient entry would still be pending .
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put online video opportunities for her mother , who died in ovarian cancer in 2007 .
Women in rural Australia are at greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than they are in cities .
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1100 Australians who found ovarian cancer in 2005 , and found that only 25 % were alive five years after diagnosis .
The QIMR ’ s research director , Susan Jordan , said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of death was 20 % higher than in urban areas .
KLEINE STUDIE : New Drug Cancers could Slow LEggs and Eggs
Researchers studied women ’ s medical care for seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that a woman ’ s age in diagnosis , ovarian cancer , preconditions , and social and economic status also influenced survival opportunities .
For older women and those who had advanced cancer at the diagnostic juncture , the survival rate was the lowest .
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of death during the study was 20 % higher than in urban areas .
Although the study did not investigate why non-city women are more likely to die from ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suggests a belated diagnosis and lack of access to best treatment centers than possible factors .
" This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists , " she said .
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distance , it proposed as possible remedies for the service of frozen doctors to allow specialists to provide women with more dense housing , as well as treatment programs for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that , regardless of geographical status , the study yielded a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer , underscoring the need for better treatment and preventive strategies .
The study , funded by Rio Tinto Rito de Conquer Cancer , is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 , Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
Losing Households
The decline , together with a larger fall in homeowners under the age of 35 , could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year when today ’ s young consumers , according to a study by the HTA , report the Financial Times , reach the “ Commonwealth Group . ”
The report states that , on average , I spend 55 % of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden .
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas with no gardens , the popular process of halving guardians for parks , and the decline in garden size is more factors threatening the industry , with an estimated £ 5 billion per year in sale .
In a large area of London , where homeowners have fallen from 61 % to 43 % for more than a period of 6 years , the lowest outlays for garden products per household are reported .
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that pockets or small gardens do not mean that people can not get plants .
Guy Barter , Chief Guy Guard Adviser for the RHS , said , " Container gardeners , for example , are popular with rent growers because they can pick their plants when they move . "
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the " Golden Age " of Water Trade , owing to rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 's to the mid-1990 's .
He also predicted improved market conditions this year , owing to better weather , following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April of last year .
The protest movement in Pakistan , led by opposition leader Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri , continues .
In the capital , Islamabad , roughly 1,000 protesters have staged the PTV state television station .
Information minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed back from PTV buildings .
The station set up its operations for about 40 minutes , but is now sending back .
At the same time , some 3,000 protesters have tried to reach Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence .
Around a kilometer from this , they confronted sticks and stones with security forces .
The police used tear gas .
The demonstrators demanded Sharif ’ s resignation , but he rejects it .
Meanwhile , the country 's army is urging a political solution to the conflict " without time to waste and use force . "
After a meeting at Sunday 's headquarters , the military said : " The army remains committed to its role in ensuring state security . "
The military plays an important role in Pakistan , and has already been coupled more frequently .
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of having cheated last May ’ s parliamentary election .
The protests escalated on weekend , after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to move to Sharif ’ s residence .
Three people had been killed .
Turkey Calls US Diplomats for Spying Report
Turkey ’ s foreign ministry has hired the country ’ s most services-old US diplomat for statements of a report on American and British espionage in Turkey .
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US embassy businessman and Turkish officials had honored the report on Monday .
The German magazine The Intercept reported that the German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British national security agencies .
According to Turkish news agencies , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the report ’ s importance , saying that all major countries spying on each other .
A former report that Germany ’ s main intelligence agency , too , had targeted Ankara , produced far more serious responses from the Turkish government .
Warmongers : Local Leaders Do Consequence for Pendler
The local leader ’ s federal warfare on the moon night could also affect the movement of people to NRW .

German locomotive chief ( GDL ) , Sven Schmitte , was told in Düsdorf .
We expect substantial defaults .
There are no regional focus .
The main execution of the Warmongers is movement of goods .
The German Road in NRW announced that it would do whatever it takes to minimize the impact .
But the GDL did not say where it wants to strike , so it is hard to foresee the consequences in concrete ways .
The Chief of Police Lady of Corruption
On Friday , the prosecutors presented evidence to Mallorca ’ s prosecutor ’ s office of blackmail by police and civil servants in the city of Calvià .
The head of the Calvià police at the Mallorca Feriensel was arrested on Magaluf , after accusations of corruption by businessmen and barracks in the infamous drug-dding pot .
The chief commissioner , José Antonio Navarro , was detained in custody after corruption accusations against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena , the street where most Bars and Magaluf Navarro ’ s nightmare clubs .
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario , the prosecutors presented evidence to the State Prosecutor ’ s Office on Corruption Controls , Mallorca ’ s , on Friday for Blackmail by police and Calvià officials .
Two other local policemen have been arrested by Spain ’ s Guardia Civil , along with corruption charges , and are consulted with Navarro by a judge .
The Spanish national newspaper ABC reported that angry wizards said that the authorities ’ cronyism had serious implications for business .
" It 's no longer about making money , " said one of the businessmen to the court .
Let our livelihoods play out .
We have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made international headlines this summer , owing to a viral YouTube video video , in which an 18-year-old British tourist was filled with 24 men during a tour Fellatio .
Inceptors have since tried to stop alcoholic holidays ’ proper behavior in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic caveats .
The Playhouse Club , in which the Fellatio incident occurred , was forced to close down for a year , while Playhouse and the Kneipentu Organizer Carnage collectively pay a fine of € 5,000 ( $ 73,000 ) .
The tourist site of Magaluf , popular with young British hotels , is also well known for several accidents , including the " balance " trend , in which people jump from Balkon to balkon to tweet .
The first spring week with near and stormy weather conditions impairs flights from the Adelaide airport .
The FRUHING has provided South Australia with an interminable surprise , with fierce actors and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport .
On the evening to 21 , another five meters of rains fell to the city , after 6.6 meters ( feet ) that had already been lost on Sunday .
The latest precipitation was the result of a series of short , stormy spectators , including a board that began just before 20 p.m. , causing nearly four meters of rainfall to decline in about 10 minutes .
After early dose of spring last week , temperatures in the city fell to a high of just 15.8 ° C on Monday .
Life weather conditions have probably led to the belated landing of a virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide .
The plane should have landed soon after 19.30 , but was hit by a boomerwind – a sudden shift in wind speeds or construction across short distances – and had to start .
wind strikes reached about 50 kilometers on the ground on Adelaide Airport .
The airplane data showed that the plane had to go through a second runway and then hit about 20.40 .
The air delay resulted in the delaying of a few other flights , including a Dubai emigration and a Quantas flight from Sydney .
For Adelaide , this Tuesday ’ s highest temperature of 16 ° C is predicted , with possible actors .
Matthies means , first and foremost , the Great Network
Given the galvanizing technological advancement that threatens to turn our cozy home into high-tech centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles with an extremely familiar electronic listening .
As I write , I see the spiral cable connecting words to the phone , and I think Boah , how retro is that ?
But there is a consideration : if the cable were not , all the villages would soon fly out in the house , and that would be significantly more retro .
Indeed , is ecologic ( ecologic ) scramble ?
No , tip failures : electronic ) sector bought - outdated - the rule that today 's world is tomorrow 's electric bankruptcy .
And today , for example , who still has a ransom television television in the living room , who says only that he fundamentally rejects television .
Why these considerations ?
Because this week ’ s urging Ifa to work reminds us of our absolute incompetence on electronics issues .
The whim formerly dominated by washing machines and CD players does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are riddled with unfathomable expert plot before him : " Connected Home , Wearables , Health Care , and Urban Technology " promises the press station .
Yes , goes ?
What should be said to people who appear to be spreading such a quarter voluntarily ?
Indeed , for about 20 years or so , it has been mainly about how we should interact with our house .
That is what the Joghurt himself can imagine to tell us , in holiday , that it burns in the workroom .
And would it be not be wonderful if we left the climate-change office to our arrival soon ?
Yes , that requires climate change .
But a dream is certainly soon realized : we lift our watch , say , " sows ! " - and at home , the dustbin 's growers go free .
They are wrong .
Everything amounts to nothing less than revolution : " The boundaries between white and brown good , " vanish an industry savage , " one can tie the washing machine with a headscarf who sends steam guards to the weather report , and the data brigade shows how long the pizza in the baccom still needs , but that doesn ' t help because we stand in the show .
We also know from daily practice : if a new fashionable is really needed , the acku will be guaranteed empty .
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the telephone will survive the next function .
Israel ’ s Children Return to their Schools after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday , having spent the summer in airspace , while rockets and murderers struck their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war and remained closed to schools in Gaza as the territory recovered from the fighting .
The school start provided a sense of pleasure and expectations to southern Israel ’ s missile-defense blocs , but the signs of the fighting are fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod , remote staff from the " Pashosh " Guard , which was hit by a missile , broke down before the students from the wings and shale rooms .
" We have a bit of fear , but we are excited , " said Ronit Bart , a Kibbutz Saad inhabitant there , and a Englishman there .
Many children from our area desperately need a return to routine .
Her 11-year-old daughter , Shani Bart , said that it feels “ a bit comical ” to go back to school suddenly .
" These were difficult times , and we have not left the house at all , " she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near Gaza border to offer his support .
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week , thousands of border residents like Saad remained in their homes , or left home to move further away from Gaza to escape the fire of missiles and villages .
Many in the Middle East , a community near the border with Gaza , where a four-year boy was killed by a Palestinian orphan , are hesitant to return .
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not returned .
Their children were , for the time being , housed in other schools .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border with Gaza that is severely characterized by the Palestinian assault .
He appealed to children to learn a lot and said , " We will ensure that their knowledge buys you and offers you security . "
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire last Tuesday .
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting , but important problems remain unresolved , such as Hamas ’ demand for lifting the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopening Gaza ’ s air and seaports .
Israel calls for Hamas to disarm and transfer the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin this month in Egypt .
In the war , more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children , according to Palestinians and the UN estimates .
Israel denies this , and estimates that at least half of the ranks are fighters , but offered no concrete evidence of the information .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and villages during the fighting against Israeli cities , most in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools rebuilt in temporary shelters .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protected areas and continue the fighting , last week the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year .
" I hope that the school will be reopened soon , so that we can continue to learn , just as children in the world and Jewish children , " said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .
According to Sakharov ’ s Choice
Given the NPD ’ s loss of votes in Sakharov , CDU Federal Vice Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the current NPD no-take process in Germany ’ s constitutional court .
Berlin – According to the CDU Federal Vice Thomas Strobl , the ongoing no-take procedure against the NPD should be put to an end in the federal constitutional court .
" The NPD performs worse than the last time , " said Strobl , who is also the chief of staff in Baden-Württemberg .
This is a good development in the right direction , and a development that makes me better off the outcome of political fights against the NPD , not before the Constitutional Court .
The NPD failed in Sunday ’ s vote just barely on the five % threshold .
In 2003 , a first effort to ban the far right had failed , because the Constitutional Protection was also at the head of the National Informants .
In December 2013 , after long preparation , the Federal Council issued a new motion in career cards .
Germany ’ s government and parliament did not join .
Harburg : Take New Refugees
Refugees are now in tangle in New Square .
The Harburg Central Action of Refugees is bursting from all quarters .
Now the interior agency has dubbed three tents of the Red Cross .
District politicians were only briefly informed - they are unenthusiastic .
" These skin frenzy continues to inflame citizens , giving district politicians no way to participate constructively in the human shelter of refugees , " says Britta Governmann , the Green Leader at the Harburg District Assembly .
Their party claims that Harburg , the district administration , is currently providing unused houses for housing .
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents .
The onslaught of aid workers is due to overcrowding – and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough places in follow-up facilities .
As a result , many refugees remain longer than the regular three months .
Housing prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years , a widely observed index .
The RP Data Corelogic Hedonic Home Value Index in Australia ’ s capital rose 1.1 % in August , according to the RP ’ s Monday data .
As a result , the total increase in June , July , and August is 4.2 % , the largest in winter months since 2007 .
The annual price increase was 10.9 % , more than twice the increase in the 12 months ending in August 2013 , but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country .
RP data ’ s research director , Tim Lawless , said that Sydney and Melbourne are pushing for a two-tier market .
The RP data show that home prices in Sydney rose 16.1 % last year , but by 11.7 % in Melbourne .
The following markets are Adelaides , Brisbane , and Darwin , where prices rose by 5-6 % on average .
At the other end of the scale , Canberra , which was hit hard by cuts in government spending , and where prices rose by only 1.4 % over the year .
Mr Lawless continued to say that early start with the next few months would see an increase in real estate , which would place a " real test on the market . "
" If one looks at the persistently high rate of auction prices , generally rapid sales , and persistently low interest rates , home prices are likely to rise further over the next three months , " he said .
In a statement to the New Press , he contradicts statements from the CEO Peer Medau and attaches to him a " field owner . "
The style of higher education is not this , says the message .
For example , Medau 's family had already been " informed in mid-June about the university 's request . "
The statement that the plans became known only in July is definitely wrong , ” he said .
At the same time , he points out that plans are not " precautionary or even decision-making , " but there are " preferences . "
Likewise , the construction of the mild road to the shutdown needed to travel is less dramatic than the Medal fear .
On a nine-meter street , it was not and is not .
Today , it ’ s 5.50 feet , which is a meters wider than before , ” explains imitation .
The argument by Medaul operators that their own cost-free and college fields will be used only by university students in the future does not want to let idolatry flourish .
Making up is not at all , because , like other public arenas , this has become intelligent .
Remememembering the Citizens
According to the Child Cup Bergtze , which is located on the mountain and whose doorstep would lead to the passage of park , the university president is said to be " not impaired . "
Instead , he insists that " it is not only about the child crisis-river , but also about inhabitants of the Friedmanite Square Road and the 800 students in neighboring real schools .
So the issue is much more than one of the special interests of Mr. Medau , " he says .
Whether criticism of child cries ' child 's parents ' council , expanding the street , " one of the few natural floodgates of Coburgs is " justified , " the reader himself can decide . "
Beginning in October , people-delivery , along with the state building agency Bamberg , wants to inform the city dreams of the higher education by 2020 , " and to address the importance of new development . "
Peer Medau had informed parents of the child crippy about the university curriculum last week .
Thus , the arrival of the new parking card is not intended to lead the Campus and the Friedmans St. Road , but rather the Medau-mountain .
This would require a two-pronged street on around a kilometer .
According to Medaus ’ s extrapolations , traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would increase ten-fold .
Speaking about 2,000 vehicles a day is the same .
The city has so far not wanted to speak out .
Glorf Returns from the Cell National Gallup
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team .
The 31-year-old state religious SG Flensburg-Handett led to health problems for this decision .
The decision has not fallen easily ; it has traveled over several months .
It is time for me to listen to my body 's signals and end my career in the national team , " the world champion of 2007 told his Facebook side .
It thus goes on to play a record of 167 countries , and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement .
Because the much-hyped retrospecter for the Flensburg Champions ’ League winner wants to go to death for several years to come , he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson .
With Iceland 's announcement on Tuesday of its cadres for the Games of Nations against Switzerland , Gland-sponsored a " long and good conversation .
His ideas and approaches have as enthusiastic as they will enthusiasm my longtime competitors and my successors .
But , for my club , I also want to be available for the next few years , which will require longer regeneration , which does not allow for the current double burden .
The left had even feared its career donation after finished infection in 2012 .
Because of Achilles ’ problems , he had been treated with a cortidal injection caused by tamenities from the German town of tobacco ( DHB ) .
Emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor that ended with a comparison .
Twelve years of professional and national team careers are not without impunity .
I have some health buildings that I can no longer ignore .
After the three infection-related soccers that were short in 2012 , I never properly grasped my blood pressure .
Add to this some other blurred complaints .
As early as the year , I have observed that while I manage my head , my body can not deceive , " Glandorf told the magazine " Handball Time " in the interview .
Only in absolute emergencies would he stand ready for comeback .
" When everyone rides , I am always ready to talk , " the family father told the specialty magazine .
But I can count on one hand the years in which I still have mobile phones .
I must also say that , after my long hospital stay in 2012 , I have also become quite humiliating about my health .
After my career , I want to go , at least for a while .
Besides the 2007 WM-title and the gain of the Champions League in 2014 , he delivered the EHF Pokal in 2008 ( HSG North Horn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) .
In 2012 , he also secured with Flensburg the European Apokal of the Pocalf ’ s victors .
Germany ’ s Economy contracted by 0.2 % in the spring .
The crises around the world have held back the German economy in the second quarter .
GDP fell by 0.2 % from April to late June 2014 .
This divided the Statiist Federal Office , confirming preliminary calculations .
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
Foreign trade , too , slowed the economy .
Thanks to the strong annual performance , the first half of the year will be a 0.8 % GDP plus the second half of 2013 .
Horstmar was the starting point , and the goal of the " Munisterland Mooists , " who first ran through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday .
The Burgmannese town of Horstmar witnessed an invasion of Dutch " hairdressers " on Sunday .
NTFU , the largest sports group in the Netherlands , staged the so-called " Munisterlande Mooists . "
This is the biggest cyclist paradise in the Netherlands , through the coin country .
More than 1,000 participants need the Munisterland to register Jos Huerne .
The tour was offered in various journals .
We are from the heroes , and we are driven overnight to participate in this roundcoaster .
We want to learn the coin , even this way , " and we would like to see the coin drivers across the road through the circles , borks , and coesfeld .
Following the melting of the Bolshevik Brotherhood club Sta .
Catharina relied on a small " road to peace " through the city , where the launch came .
Further , the route written for three different categories led to cheating over the rubble mountain to the Coesfeld , and back to Horstmar through Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
On routes of 95 kilometers , with 175 soaring meters , 120 kilometers at 1475 , and 145 kilometers at 1775 , the cyclists showed their good terms .
They were then transported to Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
The main organizer , Jo ’ s Huerne and mayor , Heinz Loil-fing , was delighted by the success of this sports Event .
We are satisfied , and it was a beautiful experience for everyone involved .
The organization went without problems , and there were no negative incidents , " Heinz Loil-fing draws a positive conclusion of that event .
Unfortunately , less than so many participants who had hoped that the age of the event would be bad weather forecasting and tomorrow .
" We see again in 2015 , hopefully , beautiful weather on August 30 or another weekend , " yet the cyclists promised to return to the Munisters and reinvent themselves .
Konstantin Wecker ’ s Strangely honest Memoirires
In fact , it is more philosophical than biography , which has brought Konstantin Wecker , Lestmaker , Pazifist , police activist , ex-detainee , to 287 papers in " monks and warriors . "
Rather than chronically , more thought laws for thought laws , the coin born on June 1 , 1947 , brought down his memoirs , every chapter with an apt letter .
And he is ruthlessly honest : from onania as a high school guest to shale theft and drug use , he does not expose a human weakness .
Likewise , to show how he has learned to be tolerant in dealing with his fellow human beings .
Smart space also occupies abstract but even more important terms : love , soul , ego , now in his place , spirituality - all of which he seeks to get on the ground , in very philosophical and very personal ways .
And he also explains his pacifism , his social critique , his political commitment - and how he has shaped not only music ( the opera leader has become a sovereign and rock musician ) , but also his prison stay .
The latter has brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk " produced by subtraction , " he says , " by " abandoning everything necessary . "
There are short anecdotes between all the high-minded views : beatings in a GIs local , for example , or a random drive , in which he took a tree head-on .
There , too , he is ruthlessly honest .
Lenny Henry – My father never took me into the arms .
Never said , " I love you . "
Henry was one of seven children of Jamaian immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry 19 was Henry 19 , worked in a factory and had limited relations .
Henry promotes a comedy " Rudy ' s Rare Records , partly based on imaginary conversation with his father and a series of radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap , with vivid melodies .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited " many " therapies after his mother 's death , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was hard to know him .
You never saw his face , he heard , “ Hour up with the crash .
Let your sister retire .
Moving !
I want to look at cricket .
My older brothers , Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up as I was a child - took to his knees and talked about things like the form of the Bierglases or the beauty of a cricket strike .
I never had such a conversation with him .
For much of my life , he was this serious kind in the corner that read the newspaper .
Henry recently opened a gunshootings in Dudley , and , though conditions are better than in his father ’ s era , he gained a glimpse at how life for him had been .
It is now a bit brighter , but they are dark , smoking , deep stygical labyrina , with flames and smoke and smoke .
My father once simply went to the wall , and then he could be told how to sing , because he could wash the guns .
When I was running there , it became clear to me that he had done so for years to bring food to the table , and that my respect for him was growing .
Yet Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love .
My father never impoverished me , he said , " I love you . "
Only when my mother went bad at the end of her life did we start saying , " I love you , I love you , " I love you . "
By his own daughter , with Dawn French , he was able to share the love he had missing as a child .
Can you protest with the " I love you " ?
But I am too poor !
Papa , I am 22 !
Dawn French .
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
It is still pleased with French , with whom he was married 25 years .
Dawn is a good person .
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends ?
She is a great mother .
Henry ’ s own mother was a diabetics .
This contributed to their death .
So when I became very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , " she must be radical .
So I got through that rigor , and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is strong .
No one likes to eat carots .
Henron ’ s career transition may be reflected in his elegant , short-cut bargain .
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello , he has been captured by the theater .
The comedy of the misconception followed , and then Fences of August Wilson .
This is a different experience from the sits and comedy that filled out his business life .
He began only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
A DTY uncovered him by imitating people and writing to New Faces about him .
His television career began in the mid-1970 's . " I was the only black imitator / comedian on television for a fairly long time . "
He learned in the profession .
I had to learn not only from the public ’ s eyes , but also from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient wize-tale machine , whereas I was a star through television , which was really difficult .
Lenny 1975 for New Faces
Since his manager had the right to chicken at Black and White Minstrel Show , a mild entertainment program in which people “ fold black , ” Henry his comedy cited more than five years .
My family was very unpleasant .
I would somehow wish that it had never happened , but I do not regret that I had .
It was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this " long-time low-cost , low-cost pillar of British television " was also a " grotesque parody of black people . "
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture , Henry was working in the 1980 ’ s on an alternative comedy circle .
The first line of Lenny Henry Show was conducted in 1984 , and in the 1990 ’ s , he was known , among other things , as the Comedyserial Chief of Cow Gareth Blacklock .
Advertising , documentary films , television , and movie roles shaped his next decade , but , after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv , he thought , " What you will do next , Len because it feels as if you can only the center or trick a little . "
Then came a Radio 4 documentary series entitled What ’ s So Great About ... ?
The first consequence was Shakespeare .
On Shakespeare , I was routinely allergic .
I had never really learned about him in school , and kept him largely in the domain of the middle class , whites in structured fhoses , and a coal-fired pot .
So I was deeply afraid of this .
Everyone who interviewed the show , Peter Hall , meeting Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judi Dench , said , " Thought to test it .
Make no bad thing if you don ’ t know what from you .
Nimm a few words , and then you understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry published 20 lines of Othellos ’ s last speech on the documentary film , and he was enthusiastic .
I felt that I could do that .
It was almost as if someone had finally turned my head right .
" That ’ s why it ’ s a serious thing , they don ’ t think , and then make you a text , a little more legitimate .
The samples were brutal , and I read that piece months before we did it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect an automobile accident , and that simply did not happen .
Soon , he entered the comedy of the misconception .
Suddenly , I was in the national theater , and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought that " Oh , you 'll change you . "
There was a technical mistake , and Henry felt instinctively that he had to keep the audience .
" One little vote told me , " You must now bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer . "
Instead , the friend ’ s head announced that the idea would continue once the problem was solved .
I went from the scene to something I said , " Oh , God was thank . "
I am not responsible for this .
I can leave anyone else to that .
" You play in a piece of theater , so your role remains . "
Henry Fences on Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , and it is strengthening .
That , too , was fine , so it is like a great sign of gods I say " that is your destiny here . "
He says this , of course , with a DONNERNDA vote .
So I stay there .
I love it .
I love being in a test room .
But Henry still heads a comedian - our conversation is riddled with humorous outbreaks , while imitating people time and again .
I chose not to make standard comedy , because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room of strangers is somehow dangerous .
Seeking that , it feeds on a wall .
I do live in Apollo when I wish to do so , but , overall , I do not have it as much as before .
I wonder if he will ever again make a standard comedytour .
The fun I have in a region with a director who helps shape a start , middle , and an end to a journey - I don ' t think I ever want to give up .
So is this his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I like to be an actor .
It fun .
One always tells a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
People love stories .
Hui rebels Block Yemens ’ City
In the conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government , the Houthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital , Sanaa .
Huthi supporters would have staffed central streets in Sanaa on Monday , a spokesman to the Huthi Party of Ansar Allah .
Parliamentary access has also been blocked .
Yemeni media report a traffic jam in the capital .
According to the online edition of the newspaper " Yemen Post , " Huthik al-Huthi , " had called for action on Sunday Day .
Huthi , according to the tables , threatened to escalate further should his demands not be met .
The Shia Houthis is fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government .
The Huthi people have been sieging Yemen ’ s capital , for almost two weeks .
Roughly 30,000 rebels have built camps on the great sea lanes of Sanaa .
In the surrounding country , bloody battles with the Yemeni army continue to occur .
Kenya registers civil servants to curb " ghost " employees .
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to expel " ghost " workers from government pay lists .
Workers who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , were they given a government ’ s share .
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive compensation after leaving the public service .
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013 .
A review earlier this year found that at least $ 1 million ( $ 700,000 ) per month was lost to " mental-employee " payments and other abusive financial practices .
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts after a person died or leaves public services , Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC in Nairobi .
All officials must now appear at identity centers over the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registration are collected have been shared in a government ’ s news .
Everyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be slashed from the payroll list continued to share it .
" This process will go a long way toward rationalizing the civil service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and adjusting the salary list on both levels of government -- eliminating " clerics , " said Anne Waiguru , the Ministry of Cabinet Secretary for Decentralization and Planning .
The client consultant Helge Achenbach scandal is first negotiated in court on November 11 .
Five heirs to Berthold Albrecht , the son of Aldi ’ s founder , Theo Albrecht , call for € 19.4 million in a civilian trial on the Düsdorkovsky village court of 19.4 million ( $ 19.4 million ) in damages of robach and two of his companies in bankruptcy proceedings .
That divided a court Speaker on Monday .
The pot says that roofs have cheated when buying art plants and eggs , and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher purchasing prices than actually paid .
As a result , the agreed provision was higher .
Eightex times , the euro bought value for € 121 million ( $ 121 million ) a year .
Children Need Roots and Rivers
He was in school for 44 years , 23 of which were a school ladder .
As a result , Manfred judges know many well-known peers and protectors from their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his desire to see the people in students .
The snow is the most famous mountain of the giant mountain .
Manfred judges loves paintings with the motive behind their homeland .
Judges were born in Trautenau / North Heights in 1930 , now Trutnov .
He was already interested , after four years , in teaching .
A year later , the Sudeten Germans were dispossessed .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave its house .
After a few months in one camp , it went to Bayans in 1946 - the Güterwagon .
So it swallowed judges into the supreme Senkendorf .
Teachers were educated in Bamberg .
As a result , Manfred judges had to walk sixteen kilometers per week at the next railway station , travel to Bamberg , go to school for three kilometers of squeeters of people across the city , and go back increasingly behind .
After two months , Manfred Judges arrived in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a bedroom , along with up to 15 fellow students in a bedroom .
In 1951 , he made the first state extinction , and after three years in 1954 .
Because supreme francs did not have free teachers for him , he went to the Bavarians and went to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954 .
The " council room " was its first " service home " in the lower house of schools .
In 1958 , he entered a three-room home next to school in the rebuilding house of teachers .
That house bought Manfred Judges in 1980 , after the Kollbach School was dissolved in 1968 .
Until then , there were three classes and five classes in the school association of Petershauses .
From 1968 to 69 , the year of schooling in 1968-69 these peers were summarized in today ’ s Rathau .
When the Indersdorf School Federation Federation was established , only local primary schools remained .
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , then-recruitor Georg Sigl changed to Karlesfeld and Manfred Judges became his successor .
But peer shauts grew , enabling the children and teachers to get today ’ s construction from September 1982 onwards , which was expanded in 1997 , according to judges ’ retirement .
Manfred judges praise then-Mayor Ludwig Götz ’ s intricate generosity , which added advertisements and expanded in 1997 , even though this was not accessible under the rules of schooling .
" Mayor Götz was very guilty , " Judges grateful .
Throughout his career , Manfred judges have never forgotten a government official who responded to a referendum on the Law and Justice : " You must never forget love , " with Manfred judges setting out what he had heard as a young teacher .
" You have to tell the children two things : roots and wings , " says the 84-year-old today .
And he learned that " it can not do it forever . " Whether he means only his students or his own six children is not entirely clear .
In any case , Judge ’ s actions were sometimes unconventional .
When students beat , they did not get a fine job , nor were they donated to their offspring .
At the expense of the community , judges had created two pairs of box-dealing , pitting the two opponents against each other , even if there were a railroad .
For the sake of the school , judges as a recruitor cultivated a good relationship with the mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
After he retired , he moved the loose judge to run for the community as at least the last CSU list in 1996 .
But judges were elected to sixth place and joined by the CSU .
Three days from 180 kilometers
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicyclists are hijacking in Bad Salzhausen ’ s Kurpark and the interim halt .
This is not unique in their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots .
But , on Friday , the sheer number of burdens seemed to be felt : the 700 respondents of the hr4-Radtour , plus a pause in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free heaven in the Scottish Alteburgpark .
Under the motto , " wheels and celebrates on newfound paths between Nidda and Child , " the participants met on Donbas Day in Bad Vilbel and lived up to a concert by Van Baker .
On Friday , it became serious : the radar took the first levees to attack 60 kilometers of flying town to Bad Salzhausen , and further after Scots .
In Bad Salzhausen , mayors of Hans-Peter Seum , who was with bicycle in Bad Vilble and the head of the self-run Bad Salzhausen , Petra swing village , were welcomed .
To rejuvenate bodies and minds , all good things had been prepared : the countrymen from Ranstadt and Rome Mocktown had packaged 85 bells , coercion , streetry , and cage seeds that miraculously faded the infamous races .
" Such cake can only make farmers " laud a participant from tube chess , while denouncing another pie .
At the beaches of the song Nidda tournunich , cold freezes could be made .
" Duo Bravo " retained visitors with known melodies from surgery and musical , and won enthusiastic applause .
The park ’ s beautiful ambition was exciting .
One man , moreover , was a headscarf from his partner : “ That he deserved , after all , he has restored already strained bicycle chains . ”
Meanwhile , the mayor and operator were still working : they were interviewed at the well before the drinking house of reporters Rainer Janke , and used the opportunity to recruit Bad Salzhausen in radio .
Similarly , since Tobias ’ s first woman to death in 2004 , he had plenty to do with local technology .
His pickup truck , in which he communicated with his staff and the police ’ s 15-member motorcycle coffers , wrote Facebook petitions , and made reporters a check , also needed a check .
" The bulk of the participant comes from the Rhein-Main area , " he told , " but " he also went out of yellow or fetus , dumping , and even many cities in Western farms .
Participation is a bit about the overutilization capacity at its disposal .
In category I , hotels attend hotels , in category II .
From the Kurdistan , the races looked good when , after a half hours , they appeared again : " Chad ! "
" It was nice in Bad Salzhausen ! " They turned away .
After arriving in Scots , the group was allowed to retreat briefly .
But on the evening , the Idyllian Alteburgpark races were called for .
Under the control of the Scottish Society of Tourism and City marketing ( GTS ) , the park had received a beautiful maintenance , and it had naturally prepared leaks , such as wildfires , with well-cooled white .
Mayor Susanne Schaab , GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld , and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner Sachs in his role as CEO of the ADAC ’ s Hessen-Things welcomed visitors .
The three were visibly pleased with the " many Scots operation . "
DJ Tobias then released the tanks .
The opportunity to thrive under free heaven was eagerly used despite sports on the bicycle .
Among the customers , increasingly , citizens who were as much tainted by the good mood as by the large rabble-drivers .
On the second day , the cyclists ' stations of Birstein , Guardian , and Bad Orb - including a confederation with the trench forest - were on the agenda .
Yesterday , after 180 kilometers of radar , athletes rearrived in Bad Vilbel .
Deprived Turkish Policemen for " Conspiracy " against the government
Overall 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the despair of the " conspiracy against the government , " local media agencies are reporting .
The police authorities offered no immediate commentary .
Among the arrested , 14 senior police officers , Hürriyet Daily News , are among them .
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations into government workers , including four government ministers last December .
In July , a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for supposedly establishing an organized criminal association and tapping up phone numbers .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ( who was then Prime Minister ) described her as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Gullen against him and other figures in power positions .
Not All Children in Ukraine Return to School
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened up after the summer vacations on Monday ( 1 September ) .
This day is traditionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk sent his daughter to school .
He told journalists that not all schools had reopened , but he was determined to defend the country for future generations :
September ’ s celebrations were not held in every school .
The sky is not peaceful throughout Ukraine .
We must fight for a peaceful sky .
Ukraine as a whole , a huge joint Ukrainian People ’ s Front , must fight for a peaceful heaven .
Aleksan Pastukhow , who attends Yazenjuk ’ s daughter at school in Slawjansk , spoke to Russian .
We hope that peace is finally restored , and that the children will receive an education that will benefit them further in life .
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children wearing depressed shirts , keeping ballon in charge , and blustering their teachers .
With Rona Fairhead , the BBC may have found the great director it needs .
It arrives with a proud banking flu , media management , and the Tory Party ’ s inner circle .
And it has its own frontline experience .
Her career began with the global management consultancy company Bain and Co. , which transformed her into Morgan Stanley , Bombadians , ICI , and the media world of Pearson .
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the parent ’ s chief executive , Pearson , went to a younger male colleague .
Their invention was supposedly almost $ 1 million .
Their political ranking , too , is solid .
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne , the former chairman of the BP when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall : it became the cabinet ’ s adviser .
Her husband is a former tory of Council member .
As early as May , I described the chairman ’ s job as a poisoned goose .
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
Trust works in two directions : the first guardian of the BBC ’ s own managerial hierarchy , but also outward as the voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong .
This creates an almost untenable duopoly , which demands full reform .
But which new chairman would risk taking the lead , reaching everything , and gaining apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while perhaps taking himself out of his job .
It is a difficult task .
As if that were not enough , many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrink – overtaking power , money , and status .
As competition approaches , and new technologies threaten old , convenient collateral , the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC carries special risks .
For the modest amount of $ 145.50 per year , the British public certainly buys in the world ’ s largest media company .
The BBC tells a good story : it says that it reaches 96 % of households , at a cost of just 40 pence a day .
And the BBC seems to be rising upward on the popularity scale : 53 % now support it , compared to 31 % a decade ago .
The sea-and utilization habits for the BBC have changed : I get news headlines nowadays on my cell phone , and later see squandered programs on my player .
But it remains a very loved and respectable institution .
She needs a formidable chairman - I hope she has found him .
Perry out of Texas says that degrading tissue was not authorized .
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a corrosive remark on Sunday about the democratic township prosecutor , who is at the heart of a criminal accusation against him for abuse of authority .
The tissue was later deleted and replaced by another by Perron ’ s user account , the previous step .
A tissue of mine was just dispatched from my account , which was not authorized by me .
“ I don ’ t approve the tissue and have wiped it out , ” he said in the later news .
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
Although the Tweets of Perre ’ s office were targeted , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
In the former Tweet , an unfavorable picture was recorded by Travis County , a township prosecutor , Rosemary Lehmberg , who was convicted of driving the tax in April 2013 .
Perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to resign , potentially leading to indictment of Perry , who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 , before a Grand Jury hijacked this month .
The tissue ’ s text is , “ I don ’ t always drive drunk with the three permissible alcohol levels ... but if I do , I sue Governor Perry when he breaks up . ”
I am the most dismal democracy in Texas .
Lehmberg ’ s office was not charged with directing the Grand Jury investigation into Perry .
It was led by Michael McCrum , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , selected by a Republican judge .
Perry pleads innocent and called the prosecution a political trick .
His highly classified team of legal counsel requested that the prosecution be dismissed in the case , arguing that the law to which the longest-serving governor is used in Texas ’ s history is unmistakably law .
Perry halted $ 7.5 million of government funds to the state 's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign .
The veto produced public complaints by a left-wing Watchdog-group .
Perron ’ s official user account is often updated – and sometimes famous .
After reclaiming as fifth in the Iowa presidential election meetings in 2012 , Perry responded to speculation that he would end by claiming a tweet of photographs near a lake , " South Carolina , we will come ! "
Berkeley Redefines Housing a " Normal "
One of London 's most prominent construction contractors pointed out that housing in the southeastern English had returned to normal levels .
Houses in the capital were hot , and the subject of huge price increases , prompting the Bank of England to place limits on mortgage lending in June , owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble .
Tony Pidgley , the founder and chairman of the high-class construction Berkeley , said on Monday : " Since the onset of the current financial years , the market has returned to normal levels of transactions since the peak of 2013 , " adding that this is a " stable hands-making environment . "
The housing market in London was well positioned during the economic downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
According to the Cabinet ’ s information , urban prices rose by 18.5 % last year alone , far more than the average rise in England and Wales .
Average sale prices for Berkeleys private , low-cost , and student offers rose by roughly one-fifth last year , and by the end of April by $ 423,000 .
But a stronger pound has made real estate ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some have also been shielded by introducing new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible " villa tax " before next May 's general election .
London real-estate broker Foxton warned last week that the mortgage market report for April , which established stronger credit provision , would also lead to slower market growth in real-estate sales and prices in the second half of this year .
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also suggests that the housing market is cooling down .
Hamptions International , another real-estate agency , corrected its prediction for the rise in housing prices in London to 3 % in 2015 , on the basis of an already weakening housing cycle .
The volume of transaction in the most expensive areas of London , such as Chelsea , Mayfair , and Kensington , according to WA Ellis , has now fallen by a quarter per year .
Nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a boon , as the maturing amounts for futures sales are more than $ 2.2 billion .
Mr. Pidgley added : " Demand for the right , well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and futures sales remained stable as a result . "
In June , the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes by the end of April – nearly one-third more than pre-crisis highs in 2007 .
The annual pretax result rose by 40 % annually , to £ 280 million , the sales rate of 18 % , to £ 1.6 billion .
In a paper presented at the company ’ s annual meeting on Monday , Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley this year were expected to equal today ’ s market expectations .
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pretax result to be 450 million .
Berkeley shares stood at $ 23.96 on afternoon in London trade .
The Internet ’ s Nacktphotos of Jennifer Lawrence
Yennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85 th Ottoman award .
Nacktphotos of the Oslo Prize laureate Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a " master list " of images of more than 100 starlets .
One representative of the star " The Tribute of Panem " confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real , indicting the hackers for " glaring violation of privacy . "
The authorities have been notified , and will prosecute all those who continue the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence .
The photographs , originally on the Foto sharing side of 4chan , were allegedly created by a gap in Apple 's online storage system , and the purported " Masterlists " of the hackvictims include the names of dozens of female stars , including Rihanna , Kim Kardashian , Mary Elizabeth , and Mary Kate Olsen .
It is not certain how many images are real , even though “ Star of Cott Pilgrim versus the rest of the world ” has also condemned Twitter .
" To those of you who look at photos taken up by my husband and I years ago in the private environment of our house , I hope you are getting you right with you , " wrote Winstead on Twitter .
Victoria Justice of the Nickondeo " iCarly " and " Victorious , " however , denied that the photographs were images of her or her " tweets " by me are GEFLSHT .
Make no mistake about the beginning . * Working game intends to mean HIV .
At late Sunday , Buzzfeed reported that a spokesman at Popular Ariana Grande was the honesty of the purported photos of her .
Exclusive exits from Howard Jacobson 's much-lauded new novel about love and letter " J . "
They crumbled , as best described it , slowly unraveling themselves as a card to be standing in the rains .
Occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , too demanding , intense , distancing , and perhaps scratch .
And then he threw his hands in .
He knew crazy .
He was stubborn , as in Igel , yes .
The last victim of this permanence was a just-beginning affair that had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual , and might even have brought him some satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomon ’ s was a tremendous beauty , with countless hair and a flourishing heart from a village on the glory that was even more remote and smoother than parrots .
She had come south with an older companion who considered Kevern her aunt , inheriting a land in a humid but paradic valley called Paradise Valley .
No one had lived in the house for several years .
The pieces were empty , the trees were still spinning , nakes had left their tracks on all stripes , and believed that they were all things , and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coffers .
It was like the house of a child ’ s bedroom , both threatening and attractive , a garden full of secrets .
The author 's portrait : Howard Jacobson , whose novel " J " stands on the Longlist for the booker in 2014 .
The Shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevern had sat with Ailinn ’ s sticking to the broken lover chairs at high levels and enjoyed an unusually wary spring Day . Both had injected herself into the service console that reassured the country with reassuring music and scant news when the sight of its crested Bollessov father remembered him in a recent blackmail .
Their feet is too big .
Given their own aggressiveness , Song ’ s of this kind were no longer played on the console .
Not prohibited - nothing was so prohibited - simply not played .
It has been successful , as the word obsolescent .
The popular taste was what layoffs and regulations never had , and how people voted for the waves of Vom-Tell-millionaire memoirs , cookie books , and love mansions , they chose the ballots in music .
In the euphoria of the day , Kevern began to play an imaginary clavier and found great feet in a gro-comical serenade of Ailinns .
Ailinn did not understand this .
" This was a famous song by a jazzonist named Fats Wall , " he told her , and sent two fingers automatically to his lists .
His father had always done so to stop the BoJ before getting out of his mouth .
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , he was told .
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers above your lists , it costs you a penny .
It had not been a very amorphous game back then , and it was not very happy now .
He knew what he expected of , that was all .
It had to explain what Jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard that story yet .
Jazz was not played , though not directly prohibited , .
Improvisation was no longer fashionable .
It was room for a single " if " in life .
People wanted to be quite sure at the start of a meloder , where it would end .
So , too , reason .
Its unpredictability made people nervous .
And Yazz was musically repressed in mind .
Though he had become 10 years old without hearing Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about the half-secret collection of his father ’ s old covert .
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fat ’ s was black .
At their age , she probably could not recall a time when pop singers were not black .
Again , there were no laws or coercion .
A constant society meant that every element of this society grateful to the principle of group gratification -- grateful as that disappeared from fate .
People with African-Caribbean origins were suited by temperament and body building for entertainment and sports , and they sang and burned .
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent , and charged with ensuring that no family remained without functioning phone .
What was left of the Polish community was calibrated ; what was left of the Greeks shattered .
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant , whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly when WAS GESCHEHEHAR , WENN GES GESCHEHEHEHENVAR happened – fearing that the flames would feed them as next – had been opened up to face fires , facing widespread extortion .
Everyone after his skills .
Having listened only to Balladen , Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words her had just issued could ever be spared .
Music was a expression of love .
" This is not really offensive , " Kevern said .
Except , perhaps , for people too big to feel .
My father never insulated someone , but he loved that song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the containment of the huge coherent leaves .
Ailinn still did not understand .
Why should your father have loved that way ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , but he hesitated to put two fingers to the lips in her present .
They already thought that he was strange .
" He looked a great thing , " he said instead .
She blighted her head indefinitely and locked in Keep ’ s view .
All over the world , there was no more to see than its razor-thin black hair .
There was nothing that he would have seen otherwise .
" If you say it , " they mean without conviction .
But this does not explain why I first .
She seemed genuinely concerned .
Are my feet too big ?
He saw again .
My feet is not so direct .
Perhaps your wretched , a little small ...
And do you say you hate me because my cleavages are too fat ?
Did you hate ?
Of course , I don ’ t hate you .
That is just the stupid song .
He could have said , " I love you , " but it was too soon for that .
" You don ' t know what you like , " he tried instead .
I am a bit perverse .
That sounded wrong .
It was supposed to be funny .
When he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble because , like his father , he did not have the reassuring charm you needed to tame the cruelty in jokes .
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel as well .
Perhaps he wanted to be , Kevern .
Despite his benign eyes .
Ailinn Solomon ’ s was rounded and dropped out of her love , threw the consoles , and shot the wine they had drowned .
Black flowers , so drunk was no excuse for him .
She seemed too tremble in her excitement , as Palmwedel did in the storm .
" And your pocket head is precisely why I feel too perverse to be drawn , " she said ...
Except that I am not .
She did him tirelessly , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that she felt when she opposed him .
Do they think he would defeat them ?
She had not told him of life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same .
The same vast and enviable ocean broke down there as there was on the shores .
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and more beloved to DEM GAS GHEHEHAR than their ancestors had been smugglers and cruisers , moved from Kneipe to Kneipe to Kneipe , always ready to take sides against a woman who refused or lost .
Dickhead ?
This would have shown you a fat fist if she did not fit up !
She was the most widely used word for erotic attraction between men and women , an antidote to Congressional robbery camps , and then beat it .
To be sure , this was an unnecessary refinement , as the butcher himself was an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomon ’ s body gave him a sign of going along .
He rose out of love as an old man .
She felt lasting as well , but the vigilance of his mourning surprised her .
That was not the end of the world .
Little did they know .
They saw him as doing away with something he had conjured , as if by a room in the upper floor , a man complained about by what he heralded .
Adam left the garden , she thought .
She felt a sudden pain for him , and for men in general , though some had raised their hands against them .
One man turned away from her , embarrassed his back , beaten , beaten , without combat spirit - why was this a glimpse that she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single time she had seen so before the day ?
When she was alone again , Ailinn Solomon looked back on her feet .
Several years before the recently tongued events , Esme Nussbaum , a smart and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher for Ofnow , the non-legislative oversight agency for public sentiment , was working on a brief lecture on continued violence at low - and middle-level levels in which reducing , if not eliminating , was most likely to be invested in the eradication , in the violence , and violence .
" Much has already been done , and much more has yet to be done , " she wrote , " to assuage the innate aggressiveness of a people who fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the country 's remote corners and valleys , where the sweet of human friendship has historically been viewed , despite the high-rise of churches between the chickens .
But some characteristics turn out to be irreconcilable .
The higher the Kirchtom , it seems , the lower the passion it continues to inspire .
The population wears itself in the villages of sentimental ballots , shudders of stories of overweening trouble , and claims to believe in virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the former raw firmly keep rural communities , as well as our urban fabric , but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and veiled contention at home , at the streets , and even on the playing fields .
" They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , " said their mentor when he read the whole report .
I propose you read fewer Roma .
Esme Nussbaum slashed her head .
I must also ask : are you atheist ?
" I don ' t think that I don ' t have to say , " Esme Nussbaum answered .
Are you Lesbian ?
Esme , again , has invoked its right to privacy and denial .
Feministin ?
Again , silence .
" I don ' t ask this , " said Luther Rabinowitz , after all , " because I was against atheism , readers , or feminism .
This is a risk-free job here .
We serve a risk-free society .
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity that are inherently acceptable and commendable can occasionally distort outcomes as you have imagined .
They obviously have prejudices against the Church , and those things you call " disproportionate " and " red " may as well be interpreted by others as reflecting force and vitality .
If WAS GESCHEHEHENT IST were to be rolled around , WENN GES GHEHEHENT , as if it had happened , it would mean taking the country its essential life force .
Esme Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz spoke .
Behind his head , an LED writer in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow gave to the country over the last quarter-century or more .
Look at their neighbor , evaluate your partner , listen to Balladen , take to music , use your phone , speak , you say , you agree , apologize .
Speaking is better than silence , the word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
" I understand absolutely what you want , " Esme Nussbaum responded with calm voice when she was sure that her boss ended , " and I say nothing but that we are not as effective as we imagine ourselves .
My concern is that without warning , we may find ourselves rediscovering how we repeat the mistakes that led to DEM WAS GESCHEHENT , WENN GESCHEHENT , in the first place .
This time , however , it is not the other that we leave out our anger and distrust .
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with his hands .
To suggest an impasse patient .
" They go too far , " he said , " if you call it " mistakes " that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
They go too far to say that they have left out their " anger " and " distrust " of " others .
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of " us " and " others " in understanding the past , such as protecting the present .
There was no " us " and there was no " other . "
It was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
" Of those who , if we are honest about ourselves , " he dared to go , " no part of society can claim to behave well .
I don ’ t like anyone .
Whether bad or good , what happened has happened .
That was then .
There is no need to be said - since we agree .
And , just as no need to be blamed , no guilt must be extinguished if such an account were appropriate , and if there were a way to eradicate it .
But what is good for the past unless we learn from it -
The past serves to forget them .
If I can say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid fall together .
" I will consider their report , " he said and dismissed it .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , she was overwhelmed by a motorcycle driver who , as the passports described , was driven onto the footsteps in a kind of " brutal rage . "
Accidents exist .
Lesothou ’ s military member says that no coup is planned ; Prime Minister remains in South Africa .
Military officials in Lesotho staged a coup to overthrow the government , saying that they were taking action against police accused of arming political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country , suggesting that the country ’ s army had overrun its tenure and occupied government buildings in the capital , Maseru .
The prime minister brought his family to adjacent South Africa after reporting of assassination threats .
Military speaker Major Ntlele said that there is no de facto coup , but that the military responded to the threat of " political fanatics " that the police faced to arm .
“ What happened tomorrow was that the Defense Forces Staff of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements within the police actually wanted to armed some of the political , partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc on harm , ” he said to Voice of America .
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that military action had made the impression of overthrow .
" Although no one has claimed to have torn the government by force , all the reports are that the Defense Forces of Lesotho have shown signs of a coup , " he said .
Speaker of the military of Lesotho said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating into their barracks , and that things were calm in the capital .
Meanwhile , Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is in charge during Thabanes ’ s absence .
Thabane said that he believed that he was targeted for trying to fight corruption in the country .
There has been great tension in Lesotho since June , after Thabane held parliamentary meetings on the basis of conflicts in his unity government .
He said that his actions did not undermine the government , despite loud accusations .
Output in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The rise in output in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in 13 months , an observed study .
The final market purchasing manager index of manufacturing ( PMI ) fell to 50.7 in August , after a level of 51.8 in July .
An admission more than 50 is an expansion .
New contracts have receded , and factories have seen declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures arrive before the European Central Bank ’ s meeting on Donbas .
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with the eurozone ’ s slow recovery , as well as with the threat of deflation at only 0.3 % inflation .
There are speculation that ECB head Mario Draghi might report more this week whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone , commensurate with those undertaken by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis .
" Although slow growth is better than no growth at all , the stalled effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers have become clearer , " said Robson , a senior economist at Markit .
For Germany , Russia ’ s largest trading partner in the EU , the factory PMI fell to its lowest level in 11 months , at 51.4 .
Meanwhile , the bloc ’ s second-largest economy , France , the PMI , fell to 46.9 .
France remains a sorry story , as does Italy ’ s decline from solid expansion to stagnation .
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial simplism no longer reach Germany , Spain , and the Netherlands are not reassuring , too , " said Mr. Dobson .
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fires of analysts who expect more monetary or fiscal stimulus .
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , the highest level since late 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight , said , " The best that can be said for the purchasing index of eurozone manufacturing in August is that the sector will continue to grow thereafter . "
He added that , “ producers in the eurozone obviously find life quite difficult at this point , as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine – widen uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
Clearly , these increased uncertainties have affected the economy , especially and consumer confidence , and are likely to delay or even fall short , especially large returns .
He said that it would be " increasingly " likely that the ECB will eventually have to initiate a kind of QE , " though we suspect that it will be limited . "
Ten years have passed since the horrific school siege that it still afflicts its children today .
Ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were held hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in South Russia .
More than 330 people , more than half of them , were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world .
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom .
Just a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan School , which killed 334 people , including 186 children , the heroic survivors of the past night warned against a new type of apocalypse in Ukraine .
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1 , 2004 , the start of a new school , that seemed like the beast of evil .
The tragedy united West and East in revulsion , and then , surprisingly , turned into action and hope in the midst of the worst hardship .
Ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , though the memory of this terrorist hell will forever pursue it .
Their Hope ?
That the war that now afflicts Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is ending .
The girl , photographed to try to climb back into the shocked schoolbox
She was photographed and famous by the Russian startup photographer Dimitri Beliakov only in her underlaunders , when she tried to climb back into the shocked school athletes after a mine exploded .
Aida searched for her mother , Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both were deemed dead , but they survived .
“ One woman told me that I was going to burn for my life , but I couldn ' t , " said Aida .
My legs were blurred .
I stood up and went back to seek my mother .
One soldier put her in security .
After a series of operations , she considered herself fully secret , but yesterday : " Three months ago , pain returned .
I fear that I must be again operating .
Some shambles are still in my knees .
Their aim is to become a dentist child in order to help people how she was helped by doctors .
" This tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me up , " she says amply .
" This happened to me , and you can not change that .
Once a year , I am always in the sports thrall to remember those who stayed there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
The pain is too great .
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva were killed there .
We played together when we were small , dreaming of going to school together .
" I don ' t want to marry until I finish my university and start my career .
I think of a family later .
She says that the siege will always be part of it , though the memory becomes somewhat weaker every year .
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors , and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere .
When I see online the photo of me as I go back to school , I think that for the first time , many people see it , understand our disaster , and help that this is not happening again .
The boy who fled the bullet believes that his mother was dead .
It was his first school day ( Russians go to school for seven years ) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother , Tamara .
As a victor , he said , " Mama told me that I should thank me if there was an explosion and hold its hand . "
After an explosion , he thought it would die .
She said to him : " run . "
It fled , full fear that it could be dead , and saw an inviting small child on the way , took sides in hand , fleeing through a bullet .
His father , Vladimir Putin , who got his son out of his arms , said , “ Damir told me that his mother died .
He said , " I couldn ' t save them . "
In reality , Tamara was stumbled out and saddled with hospital embargoes , in turn assuming that her son had died .
After reuniting , she said , " I dare with pleasure .
I could not believe .
He burned and impoverished me .
Damir was later flown to London ( from the now-dissolved News of the World ) to get the title of a Barnardo ' s Children ' Champion ' by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife , Cherie .
" This horror haunts you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering , " he said yesterday .
But I can say that it is becoming blurred in my memory .
I still know that I swept away all my toy stars immediately thereafter .
But now I can play computer games with gun scenes , and that is not a problem for me .
" I am not afraid to go into the sports thals , but I don ' t think about myself .
I remember these children with whom I played in the court , and which I failed to get out .
We never say that they have been killed or dead .
We say that they have remained in the sports thrall .
I remember my trip to London , especially the Games Shew , where I could select everything I wanted and travel to an open car .
But now he is frightened for places like Ukraine , where wars cause the kinds of misfortune he and his friends suffered .
This horror haunts you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering it .
" It is so sorry for all those suffering from the Greys , " said Damir , who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week .
I wish to help that way .
One day I want to go to the police , hoping that they will take me to school school next year .
His mother , Tamara , 48 , said : “ 37 children from our neighborhood were killed , can you imagine it ?
I recall the terrible post-siege silence , there were simply no children who could call and run around , and that silence lasted many months .
She vividly recalls her trip to London with Damir .
The people of London joked when I told our history .
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support .
She was a cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her that 10 years have passed , but I still remember her and her husband ’ s meeting in London , and how the Damir and me helped me .
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschch , calling her all local Russian restaurants .
I recall playing with waves in a restaurant , shot with his water pistles at them , running away and playing with him .
And that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us .
She said , “ I always think that the world has not gotten better over those 10 years .
War in Ukraine is now going on , and people die every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and still killed .
These are just as children as we are .
I think that for many of the war it is part of the news they hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else .
I just know what these people feel , the entire horror .
And I can not stop feeling that way .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
Damir became large and is a very gentle and calm boy ; he is not aggressive or angry at all .
He , for example , does not seek revenge ; he is not overwhelmed by past bodies .
I do not like to recall him , but he has six close friends from the class , and they occasionally enter the sports thrall and ruin .
When he was smaller , he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes looked out on the sofa that turns face away from us indefinitely .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he continued all of his weapons and other military tools , and that is now 17 , larger than I look , brilliant , intelligent , and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again .
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my feet , I saw hell around me , with surrounding body components .
I was absolutely sure that my small boy in that hell could not possibly survive .
" I remember calling him " Damir , travel , " but I was so sure he didn ' t listen .
But he listened and went away .
So life , unlike that of many , continues for us .
Georgia Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the Greuel of Beslan .
To console : Georgia ’ s Beslan-surviving Lyin , with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004 , looks right to Georgia today .
His blood-soaked face was fearful when he burned for his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classrooms .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beslan barbarism .
His mother , Fatima 54 , a physician , deposed him for his first school day , before rushing to bring her elderly son , Vladimir to university .
" I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , " she recalls , " my small boy there for three terrible days .
Not only was there a family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
Only my Georgian was able to survive .
The closer that date comes , the harder it is to think and talk about .
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it was long ago , I think yesterday it had happened , some scenes of those days have followed me immersed .
No one will ever forget that I am talking to you .
Importantly , the image of Georgia ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack , and was blurred as a statue ( the right ) .
I remember that Georgian wanted to go to school this day , saying that he wants to impoverish his teacher .
I knew only that he was alive when I watched him on television .
And now there is even that smattering Georgian statue in San Marino .
Georgia does not like to see the picture , and it is hidden at home in the bookstore .
I understand this , but I also think that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image .
“ It is important that Georgian people can never do again .
" I doubt that we ever know the truth .
People repeatedly examine such tragedies , never knowing the truth .
Now they are investigating the downing of the boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever learn what it caused ?
This world is becoming a terrible one .
" I can not understand how this is possible , because when you ask people , no one wants a war , so how does it ?
Ten years are not such pain at all .
We need dozens of years to forget it a little .
It has attacked my health , and I still feel it .
For about three or four years , I had some nightmares about siege , but then it did better .
I returned to school later in 2004 , and were afraid every day .
I thought of my friends and classrooms who had been killed .
That is why I am always in the sports thrall when September 1 approaches .
I want to take my old girlfriend ’ s tribute .
It is hard for me to go into the sports thals , but I have to do so .
I do not feel victimized ; that story is now part of my past .
I won ’ t forget , but I don ’ t sympathize .
My life goes on .
I completed school this year and visited a medical school in Vladikavkaz .
I will be a heart surgeon .
My first election was an education in the army .
I wanted to be a soldier , but my health did not allow it .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that won ’ t happen .
Georgia ’ s Faniyev , 20
The boy who survived , despite being trapped in the feet of a murderous terrorist .
One miracle : Georgia ’ s Faniyev was trapped in the siege of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
During the siege , he was trapped in the sports thrall and sat next to the bomb , which was firmly on the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It is really surprising that he was not killed .
" We feel it had been yesterday , " says Georgia , who , as a intelligence officer , wanted the FSB , could not do so because of its health damage from the siege .
It is still with me that it is not what I have left behind me .
I am older , and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that is wrong .
" I worked with psychologists in 2006 , and in fact felt a bit better after that , but I can not forget it .
And I would like to forget .
In 2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I returned to the sports all .
I lost awareness .
I will never return to the ground , and don ’ t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture .
Surviving : Georgia ’ s Faniyev today , with a photo of himself in the hospital following the siege on the laptop .
My pain is enormous , and I encounter it with me every day .
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it , and they never asked me about it .
Physically , I do well .
I should be cautious about my wounded knees , but I can do well now .
But , because of my health , I could not study the FSB intelligence college in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have my documents , including those of medical doctors , and they have responded that it is not possible .
My second passion was the animals , so I went to the veteran medical institute .
I have had two years behind me .
He learns the treatment of all animals " from cats to cows . "
He said , “ I knew I would never tell my children about my experience .
Children should know nothing about this , and they should not , of course , suffer .
His mother , Marina , 42 , said : “ That pain never leaves me .
He is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
I will commemorate the celebrations .
I know that Georgia will not backfire .
He must be much more severe for him , because he was and I was not there .
I waited home and could not help .
I am God so grateful that he has been returned to me . Here in Beslan , all of them are recorded .
It remains in us .
Georgia is now an adult , but that horror remains within him .
It is hard to accept this when something so unfair strikes .
He is a boy , he likes sports , but he can not participate for his knees .
He has been operated several times , he can run , but can not exercise .
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50 % , but you can never overcome it entirely and forget .
This terrible experience will always haunt us .
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege , and that only amplifies my pain .
I have lost many people I knew well , and whom I was expensive .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could make me , but that my heart wept around the gods .
I know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who never married again .
It is difficult to accept that life will continue , even if you don ’ t want it .
I will never forget how my heart came to me when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people fighting for ?
Why are they killing each other ?
The war is now very close to our country , and I almost can not believe it .
We used to be a friendly country , how can we be fighting ?
People and children suffer , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine , and many are still killed .
If only we could attack and postpone all of these rebels , as far as possible .
Aljona Tskaev , 10
The baby , so mature by a specialist squad , was secured .
In short , Aljona Tskaev , a Russian special squad , is being put to safety ( left ) .
She is now ten ( right ) and does not recall the cruelties at all .
The world held its breath in 2004 , when the baby Aljona was lifted to the poor of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan .
The terrorists left them , but they held their 30-year-old mother , the 10-year-old sister Kristina , and their brother Makhar in school sporthals .
Machar , then three years old , escaped , but Aljona ’ s mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
Her father , Ruslan , has since remarried her new wife , Swetlana , has a small girl , named him after his lost daughter , Kristina .
Aljona , now ten years old , does not recall the siege , and has grown into a smart and happy girl , say neighbors .
" They are now a great fortunate family , Aljona , and Makhar are both great children , " says a close friend .
Ruslan is a phantastic father , and wants to avoid all the memories raised with the tenth anniversary .
They will understand why .

4 Tigs for Better Water Water Places and Videos
There is a selection of devices if you want to make photos or videos underwater .
The cheapest option is a water-density Point-and-Shoot , such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action Cam like GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both of which have about $ 300 .
I have included these photos in a family firm with several cameras , all available at less than $ 350 .
Regardless of equipment , there are some rules for the best outcomes .
Take control of your equipment twice .
Even if you have a water-density camera , you understand that the battery ceiling and other roofs are finished .
Imagine your camera on the photos or videos you want to take in .
Some cameras and Camcorder have scenes and revenue monkeys to optimize the duration time for the Danish underwater conditions .
Before stepping in , consider the depth of your equipment capable of functioning .
Some cameras are permitted only up to 5 foot , others to 50 or 60 foot .
Searching for conventional and water-density models in our shopping leader and evaluations for digital cameras .
Make multiples -- because many will not fall .
Point-Shoot cameras usually do not have an LCD to complicate images .
Even if you have a LCD , it is difficult to watch this under water , and the right exposure is a lucky one .
So let ’ s make many of the stories .
If your camera has a travel mode to make a series of not-so-modified concepts , use it .
Let ’ s close the surface .
The light becomes dramatically worse as you move away from the surface .
So , if you can keep your surface dense , if you make it into a pool , a lake , or sea .
This can also bring more color into your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
Consider the objects .
That is a good council to land , too , but it is all the more important because of poor lights under water .
It is especially important when you work with an Action Cam : these devices often have a firm Christmas cellinse , which means that you must have your objects more densely if they are to fill the entire accounting drain .
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character is altered , even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS .
As a consultative practitioner , he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony and the agony of treatment .
Among his patients , he recalls , his wife was a MIM employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that doctors were important to diagnoses and diseases , while persecution is mostly pretty different : pain .
One day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose guiding path began .
" I didn ' t feel , " he wrote in May of this year .
I found it difficult to pump up .
As he struggled with the flupe-like symptoms , he noted that he made Juliet impatient for his wife .
" I want everything right now rather than later , " he named .
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt unusual , without reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to undertake a X-ray investigation of his brother .
Just two weeks ago , he had been scratching in the French nightmare .
The result of X-rays examination was made .
He suffered from Mesotheliom , an incurable cancer who was afflicted by the breast , that is , by assaulting the lies .
As with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
For example , while some smokers have died from lung cancer , not all lung cancer sooner smokers have been smokers .
But Mesotheliom is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger is an asbediment - contacts with the fiber , once considered a " silver " drug , but now a deadly one .
For most of us , Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore how easily .
Asbest , after all , is a product of the past .
The most dangerous asset type has not been used in Britain since the 1960 ’ s , when industry volunteered to stop using it .
Even where it was still used , only people in certain industries worked directly with the stuff - plumbers , construction workers , the teeth , and advertising workers .
Today , as an industrial powerhouse from another time , it hardly seems worrisome .
But this complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , is now experiencing the climax of a mesthelioma epidemic .
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world .
With 2,500 deaths per year , this disease kills twice as many as one in traffic accidents .
Since 1980 , Mesotheliomtoxins and projected future deaths in the UK have been growing .
The reason why we have now seen the deadly effects , though asbestos have been illegal for years ( all asbestos have been banned in 1999 ) is that a pesotheliom has developed only after decades .
And the Mesotheliom scourge is not confined to former construction workers .
Asbest was , and often still , in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn , and the shops we buy .
As a result , Mesotheliom knows no class sick , financial boundaries , professions , or age .
The privileged bases , from elegant shopping houses in London to private schools , are no room for protection .
Parliament buildings are assailed .
Even in the hospitals where we are to be healthy , this lethal carcinogens began .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
Nor was he a plumber .
Indeed , he found it hard to imagine where he might have come to contact with asbestos .
Then he discovered it .
" There is a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Guy ' s Hospital , where I was educated for six years . "
All - students , nurses , doctors , and pilgrims - use the tunnels .
How many of my age members will suffer from the same disease ?
Unfortunately , he could answer that question at least in part .
" Of the four doctors trained at the Guy ' Hospital and illuminated by Mesotheliom over the past five years , " he wrote in 2010 in a letter , " I am the last to live . "
How many of us become sick ?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom at age 48 .
When he died this year on February 17 , he was 55 .
This was an unusually long period of survival .
Fifty percent of all Mesothelic diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis .
The disease always ends fatal .
So we can only repeat Lawson 's question : " How many of us will become sick ? "
Britain ’ s leading expert on Mesotheliom , professor Julian Peto , assumes that if the asbestol epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to grind to a halt , it will have lost 90,000 of the disease .
Most do not yet know that they will die that way .

A brief look at the files of the courts , to which those involved often turn for compensation requirements , shows how far the scourge of the mesothelic boom is already common .
In June of this year , for example , Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negatively exposed to asbestos .
For nine years , she worked for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations – one of the flagshipstors in Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began operating at M & S .
Now she has two children in the twenties .
" Before that , " she says , " I had never heard of Mesotheliom , I didn ' t know even much about asbestos .
I would never have thought that this would affect me .
There are few who know much about asbestos .
The fact is that the term asbestos does not include a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name derives from the word " assignature , " a description of the façade structure that makes it resilient and flexible .
Three of the six were used in construction .
Chrysovalence , also known as white asbestos , is now by far the most commonly fed in buildings .
It was used for deforestation squads , pedestrians , raw corps , boilers isolation , even for brakes in cars .
It is less lethal than other forms of assistants , yet the EU and the WTO still view it as a " high risk of health " with possible death .
But more dangerous is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestoth ( Crokydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that " there are clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for unique high mesotheliomrates . "
A Marks & Spencer staff staff was exposed to Alamy at the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street , London .
Janice Allen may not have seen herothelioma victims , but Julian Peto ’ s work suggests that her history is by no means unusual .
He has presented a study of those affected who show that " a substantial proportion of mesotheliome was probably caused by environmental asbestos without a well-known replacement , either by work or at home . "
Much of this contacts is based on the " normal use and aging " of our buildings .
It looks as if no one can expect to be safe .
A report by Goddard Consulting , who studied the Westminster palace , shows how people at the heart of government might have been unconsciously exposed to the attack .
In 2009 , Goddard reported that services and pipes were contaminated with asbestos that could be injured by something as harmless as " strong air movements . "
MPs are often accused of addressing their own interests , but here it looks as if the opposite is true .
While the Diet of Parliamentary Labor has insisted that the West minster palace has received a " clean health , " it is now undeniable that £ 1 billion needs to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament , modernize electric installations , and remove the asbestos , and that , after the 2015 general election , legislators will probably meet in the nearby QE2 headquarters rather than in the West Bank .
The Gore report also pointed out that " the presence of asbestos was not treated according to respective regulations . "
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life .
All you can do now is wait .
One person who has never been able to accurately dominate contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
Like Andrew Lawson , the 50-year bott suggests that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
" I worked in a hospital where assistants were chosen positively , " he says , " but I can not prove it in my case .
It is so difficult to recall every place you worked and the data .
What he remembers is the day in early December 2009 , when he received a kind of fever .
He was 45 , and it was just a late operation .
Suddenly , I had shaken jokes .
It came suddenly .
I felt terrible .
I believed that no longer could make the journey home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain stemmed from the fraud skin surrounding his lies .
But , like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a pesotheliom .
He did not go to work a month .
Admired doctors made X-rays of his brother , and have used Pleurakathesis to take out lungs and test them in the laboratory .
But his complaints remained undiagnosed .
His health slowly improved , and returned to his job .
From time to time , however , symptoms returned , often after exercise and heavy breathing atoms .
In 2011 , a patient with similar symptoms entered his practice , and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom .
Now , too , it did not associate Abbott with his own case .
After all , his patient was a few decades old and had worked directly with asbestos .
The link was clear .
Abbots worsened again in September 2011 , and his home doctor brought his CTscan and X-rays to an expert group .
In December 2011 , just two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time , a camera-equipped sun was introduced to the heights between the river and the crust .
I am an optimist .
For the most part , I just keep saying , " he says .
Frankly , I had not worried so many .
But chess , my wife , was concerned .
The result of the biopsy was a week between Christmas and New Year : " It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom . "
Graham Abbott : Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly , Abbott Termine with Macmillan-nurses , one of whom recommended taking a lawyer .
Only now did it grasp the magnitude of the epidemic .
" It turned out that asbestos were very widespread , especially in large public buildings where honor was often isolated with asbestos , " he says .
People exposed to the asbestos of these buildings are now sick .
So Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous piece of assisted isolation in hospitals was below the earth , so patients were unlikely to be exposed to the stuff .
But many staff who walked into pedestrians from one building to another ( such as Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canintines ( as Graham Abbott often did ) were almost likely to get into contact with the toxic substances .
It turns out that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been life-saving to patients , but life-threatening to physicians acting .
He remains away today .
Students dropped their broadcasters on assistants .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos was often used in offices , stores , libraries , and city thals , owing to its fabulous isolating and collecting characteristics .
Schools , too .
Indeed , many people have probably had the first class assault contact .
Throughout the country , in thousands of chemical rounds , students have turned their broadcasts onto assistants .
The issue of asbestos is now often raised on Web sites in schools .
Meanwhile , as innocent subjects in our homes , such as soccer boats and shop butchers , have contained standard asbestos .
" It is an industrial poison contained in much of our real estate , " Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy 's Hospital , observed .
In one case , the only contacts that affects a woman was the demolition of a garrison shot in the 1970 ’ s .
So , just how you shoot your garden shoots .
The impact of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
" It takes time to process , " Graham Abbott says .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I noted that I could not focus on what I was doing .
I was in practice two weeks .
Then I knew I went and had to take care of myself .
Well , I will not see another Christmas fixture .
The greatest difficulty was to change the outlook from a doctor to patient ’ s .
Like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information with which he had to cope .
" It was very hard to admit everything , " he says .
" I asked my doctor " how long do I have ? "
And it gave me about 12 months .
I remember thinking , " Na yes , I will not see any further Christmas fixes .
That was `` then . ' '
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious , because it is our life-support mechanism – the breathing itself – that causes fatal cancer .
Most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos .
Asbestos consists of small fires .
If the asbestos are bundled , and the fires are inliterated , they can be found in the breast falling skin over the lines .
Asbeliers irritate the fall and can trigger cell mutations .
" The problem arises with the indignant nad-shaped asbestores , " as Professor Tom Treasury professor Tom , a heart Thorax doctor who changed to the Guy 's Hospital in 2001 .
Ironically , the very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now a leading center in treating Mesotheliom .
Treasury securities knew Lawson and treated a few others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their hospital training .
Once the asbediments reach the lung tissue , they say , " they are marginalized from the respiratory process of where the skin is .
From the outset , it is invasive .
The usual options for other cancers do not work well in Mesotheliom .
The effectiveness of an operation , for example , is hotly contentious .
Some say that it is worth trying .
Treasury bonds say no .
" You can not cut the breast fell out , " he says .
They do not get around the knife .
Meanwhile , the cancer " does not speak of chemotherapy as well as " showing " the impact , " but not cured .
" Sometimes there are long-term survivors , " says treasuries .
But , in the end , they all die .
Fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott is still fighting .
Having contacted Mesotheliom , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had become a one-man support and advisory office four years after diagnosing him .
" Hallo , Cancer Centre , " he spoke contemptuously of calls .
" He was very positive , " says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier , and was still very active .
Initially , Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would take four months to extend his life by just one month .
" I was desperate , " he says .
I wanted to abandon .
Lawson , however , " managed to make things look more positive in a somewhat more positive light . "
Following the advice of several doctors , Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lazdunski , a heart Thorax specialist on Guy .
" We had an advantage by not having to be expelled , I called on it , and got a date " to Graham . "
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for treatment to be approved .
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to perceive the best treatments available .
But when these treatments inevitably fail , many people are worried about another financial concern – about the future of families that they leave behind .
So they turn to courts in the hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson countered Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LP .
" It has been known since 1898 that asbestos are extremely dangerous to health , " Morgan says .
But what changed in the 1960 ’ s was that it recognized that a very small burden was also a health risk .
And here , companies ’ negligence began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy ' Hospital eventually put their case in place , but it was not what Morgan calls a " full-fledged compensation , " because Lawson could not prove absolutely certain that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestol on the Guy .
After examining his death , however , a Guy spokesperson acknowledged that " the assistants in the affected area were removed in the 1990 's . "
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How to Get Asbestol
Indeed , it is a huge problem for Mesothelioma ’ s illnesses seeking compensation to ascribe to a firm ’ s deadly asbestores or a job – usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance accounts can be lost .
And those who oppose claims know that time is time for them , but certainly not for the plaintiffs .
In response this year , there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliomen to sue compensation , even if her former employers are no longer present .
The law created a $ 350 million insurer-industry fund for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 , with contacts but can not sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court could have said about $ 120,000 in a normal compensation process .
Some 300 successful programs are expected per year .
Andrew Morgan , like so many Mesotheliomi people , thinks that £ 350 million was a " very good job " of the insurance industry .
" This is a deal of insurers for insurers , " he says , " and suggests that this figure is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not gone beyond it , and that Mesotheliomi illnesses could find companies and sue them normally .
Mike Penning , then Labor and pension minister , also admitted that the law was " imperfect . "
But both pensions and Morgan admitted that , given seven deaths every day , rapid action was needed .
" People suffer so much now , " said Penning during the second Mesotheliomi hearing last December .
At that point , Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lazdunski for 19 months .
After its first deliberations , long-term Lazdunski recommended an operation that , unlike Tom treasure , would have a positive impact .
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy that allows long-term Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 % for five years .
Abbott felt stronger .
" This is , of course , the most important , " says abbott .
Patients see this repeatedly .
There is something that leaves you on .
If you are complacent , you will be worse off very quickly .
Graham Abbott was subservient to the operation in March 2012 .
By late August , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles to emerge .
Subsidies showed no sign of the disease .
Then I had a Scan in March 2014 .
There were several cancers of my breast .
I just became 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
That is life-ending .
Again , Abbott was subject to six chemotherapy cycles .
Now , no trace of tumors is visible .
But the process is physically and mentally demanding .
They need to think about practical things - about money when I am not , for example , or about my wife how boilers are working .
If you get bad news , you will be negative .
They must look forward .
As father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
" This is hard for parents , " he says .
It is hard to know what to say , and how much .
When I was first diagnosed , I said that I had a disease with which I would not become old .
They responded differently .
Tamsin is very healthy and unruly .
She told her friends , and we soon received very many calls .
Ellie was more restrained .
It did not say much .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must endure .
But such talks are not about hope , not hope , for Mesothelioma ’ s disease .
The disease ( as it finally does for Stephen Jay Gould ) brings grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , " Mesotheliom is not life-threatening .
Breakthroughs in Asbestol Disease
Asbeliers used to reinforce cooking crews and for greater heat warfare .
Plinius of the elderly describes asbestos .
A tissue has been developed that is not burning .
I saw service shops in cameras .
The use of modern commercial asbestos is beginning in Italy , where it is used to produce paper ( including money ) and stuff .
Major asset mines are opened in Canada and South Africa , and soon after in America , Italy , and Russia .
It is the ideal resilience of the steam engines and turbines of the industrial revolution .
Global asset production is rising to more than 30,000 tons per year .
Statisticians from Prudential identify a premature death rate for those who work with asbestos , which then do not receive life insurance .
Nellie Kershav dies in Rochdal .
Dr. William Cooke says that assistants in the lungs " are the main cause of death without any reasonable doubt . "
That is the first such case .
Kershaws ’ employers , Turner Bros Asbestos , do not take on liability .
There is no substitute for harm .
During World War II , ships , one of the most deadly facilities , are being built with asbestos .
Free industry Determination of Blue Asbestos
A Court of Appeals confirms the United Kingdom ’ s first successful human-damage operation for contact with asbestos .
Global asset production is rising to more than 4,213,000 tons per year .
Britain imports 139,000 tons .
A UK health and security executive commits all firms working with asbestos to licensing .
Import and use of blue and brown asbestos are legally banned in Britain .
Any use of asbestos is banned in Britain .
The Mesotheliomi Act is passed in Britain .
A € 350 million compensation program is announced .
Asbestos are banned in more than 50 countries , but white asbestos continue to be used as low-cost construction materials in many countries around the world .
Global output is around 2 million tons per year .
China refuses Hong Kong ’ s right to choose government ; demonstrators retaliate
On Sunday , despite increasing calls for democratic reform , China ’ s parliament voted against nominating candidates for the 2017 election by Hong Kong ’ s electorate .
This is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong ’ s business district , while activists initiated planning and mobilizing it in a matter of hours after the declaration .
The ruling by the People ’ s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to dismiss all non-compliant candidates .
" This is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , " said legal expert Emily Lau , Chairman of the Democratic Party .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
Hong Kong residents were lied .
And it is clear that we are witnessing an authoritarian regime .
In defending the Chinese decision , Li Fei , deputy general of the Standing Committee of the National People ’ s Congress , said that authorizing public nominations in Hong Kong ’ s elections would be “ chaotic . ”
Since 1997 , when the United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese , Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants choose the government ’ s presidency from 2017 onwards .
China ’ s leaders presented Sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because there is a direct suffrage for Hong Kong ’ s citizens , but the decision also makes clear that China ’ s leaders will continue to control the process through a tightly controlled nomination committee .
Moreover , a new clause is to allow only candidates " with love of the country and love of Hong Kong . "
The decision follows a summer of Hong Kong ’ s largest and most publicized protests in several years .
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central Love and Peace Movement , whose organizers threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing permits a genuine universal suffrage .
On Sunday ’ s day morning , hundreds of Occupy Central followers gathered in front of Hong Kong ’ s ruling headquarters within hours of the declaration .
In the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned for protest waves in the coming weeks .
But they did not come close to this , apparently to avoiding problems with the authorities .
In a online policy , the organizers said that the movement " considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort , a move that should occur only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice is made .
It is easy to say that all opportunities for dialogue have been exploited today , and that occupation of the central district will take place definitively .
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days to announce Beijing , and security measures , including police and barricades , were strengthened on Sunday before the government buildings .
The unrest is fueled by the sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
The movement of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services .
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong ’ s values , such as democracy and free speech , are crumbling under growing pressure from Beijing .
Some criticized the Occupy Central demonstrations , which jeopardized business activity - Hong Kong 's lifeline .
" The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage , depending on how many of them are involved and how long they endure , " said legal expert Rebedev Ip , who has long criticized the movement .
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong will run out of control .
This impression is bad for investment .
China ’ s state-controlled media also recently reported as subversive agents controlled by Western powers by Hong Kong ’ s pro-democracy activists .
This summer 's activists organized an informal referendum on the electoral rights of 780,000 people - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong 's voters .
In July , tens of thousands participated in one of the region ’ s largest democratic demonstrations .
The tradition of graduation in the US is now transferred to universities , where Freshmen are offered performances with private aircraft .
We look forward to responding to this demand and to Britain ’ s first luxurious travel service for students today .
To achieve an especially impressive university entrance , the company also offers transport routes , such as private aircraft , Rolls-Royce Phantom , Aston Martes , or McLar P1 .
Mr Stewart also said that the service had a security saving .
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to pocket their professions in a dangerously overblown car through the country .
Together with our new VIF options , we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach university with a minimum level of effort and maximum luxury .
One corporate speaker said that no new accounting was yet available , because the service had just been introduced , but added that " students would write the service in the next few weeks . "
The company also said that , despite tuition fees of $ 9,000 per year , it expected a market for that offer .
Today ’ s students are very different in their expectations and claims from students 10 , 20 , 30 , or 40 years ago – it is more important than ever that , and VIF can make that seem great .
The National Student Union , however , criticized the service as being removed .
Megan Dunn , the US vice president for higher education , said , " This offer seems totally separate from the lives of the majority of students .
Many students who begin to study this month face a crisis in living costs , as available financial support in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep up with soaring bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can think of spending thousands of pounds on something like the advent of student homes .
Feminists Criticism Race and Police Behind Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Moon .
The participants raised their hands and sang " hands high , not shooting , " while waiting before the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , on the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown , the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez , observed a shift in the online white feminists .
After their experience , white feminist commentators place gender before race in addressing reproductive law and income inequality .
But , while tensions across the Middle East rose and received heed throughout the country , Perez saw white women ’ s answers turn to 100 % .
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the pupils of August 9 , the personal essays of titles like “ Ferguson came from a white woman , ” and " feminism is not just about suppressing women " relatively late .
But that meant an important shift for Perez .
" I don ' t believe that feminism finds many people who are white and have to speak privileges in such classic ways , " she said .
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents .
It is characteristic of the crisis that we find , and because the situation in Ferguson is so rampant that they must express it .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University , Ferguson exposed problems that are subjected to black American women every day but not seen as " women 's themes " in cultural space .
" I can publish something amusement on Facebook about me and my partner , " Mitchell said .
When I trumpet about how color in her own country is under siege , the silence is deafening .
" How can women be sure to speak publicly about a relationship , but not about public security ? " she asked .
There is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems for black women like Mitchell , who have studied race , gender , and sexuality in US history .
For them , black women have not had the luxury of cleaning up the issues ; they live in the combined reality every day .
While white women now connect the themes of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles , Angela Hattery , a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University , says that their predecessors did the opposite .
" From 1865 to 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were dynasted , and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , " said Hattery .
White women have had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchmord .
For Hattery , the split between white and black women came at the point where white fighters analyzed women ’ s electoral law like Susan , Anthony , in the late 19th century , and found that fighting the right to vote could succeed only for one group : women or black .
" They made the decision to lobby for women 's electoral system , " Hattery said , " the right to vote for blacks later .
When you recall such things , you know with force why non-white women do not trust white women .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women won the vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
Almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , Mitchell says .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played " fingers " with the problems with which black women have struggled for generations .
" Wouldn ' t it be tolerable if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms are as serious as they are about the right to start a child ? " Mitchell asked ?
Second generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to recipient resources are now trying to understand what that means .
Gloria Stein , a prominent white feminist activist , went to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown , publishing an article by Rebecca Carroll , the Guardian columnistin , demanding more protests from white Americans on racism .
" I hope that women who have one other , but another , reason to understand a inherent danger to the body -- and opinions about race that are markedly different in public polls -- will lead the changes , " wrote Stein .
Although stones stand for more intersectional feminism , addressing racial and gender issues , some of their comments on the racial issue in America are amazed .
Christina Sommers , a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of " Who Stole Feminism ? " told The People that young men in the United States , especially young color men , are " far more vulnerable than their sisters , " but " Steinem 's remarks on Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism .
There are now hundreds of specific programs for girls and young women , but almost none for boys .
But when the White House recently launched a small program , My Brother ’ s Keeper , to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men , there were angry reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Stein .
The relationship between police and the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the mainstream feminism ’ s foremost .
This year , after the US border police seized nearly 63,000 inadvertently on the country 's western border , the immigration reform issue has resurfaced - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , co-chairman of We Belong Together , an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform , said that , for a reconsideration of the issue as a significant issue , she must publish only the stories of immigrant women women .
" They speak for themselves , " Mercado said .
When the vast majority of labor visas go to male immigrants , the women they accompany are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
" These stories resonate in the women 's organizations , " she said .
" Pig House " in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house sold became remote from real-estate brokers when it became clear that it had become comfortable in the living room .
The released house has a bedroom , is on a private street in Ipswich , and is offered for $ 120,000 .
Among the details was a demolition of the house 's living room - including a pig that had built his head on a sofa .
Housing maker Connells said that the pig was the owner ’ s house .
" The photographer was mistakenly published , " however , and has now been said a corporate spokesperson .
In Exposé of the House , Connell described the former assembly as a " unique family with a bedroom . "
Although the broker has removed the picture from the Web site , it seems to be even advertising material .
Housing sales became interested in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .
The SW-City of Harvard is home to a new millionaire after lotty profits .
This month , a Harvard Lotary Gambler
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth , with a happy winner who receives almost $ 1.1 million from lottery on Saturday .
A newspaper kiosk in Harvard for the second time in five years dragged the hackpot to join the first vision , after $ 1 million in November 2009 .
The happy winner , however , has yet to report .
The shopkeeper Steve Forward has said that he is making a profit for talk in the small city of Perth in the southwest of the city .
The city talks about nothing , and everyone is rather uplifted .
We thought that such a profit could occur .
Eight WA winners gained in the first vision last month , a fair degree for players in the state for a few weeks .
Last week , a Canning Vale player of Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August , after a couple from Belmont had won the $ 7.5 million mega-gain just weeks earlier .
The victors ’ few had been playing for twenty years , saying that the profit allows them to travel globally and buy a new house .
Harvard millionaire is the 59th winner of this year ’ s first vision in the WA , with a total of nearly $ 85 million .
Leonies called into the Gladiatora Space
Not only did the Gladiatorians find themselves in a state of necessity at the first Rhine Rome Day in the leisure park .
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract yesterday far more than 1,000 visitors who braved the rainboxers and the warm cold and were unenthusiastic by the historical spectacle .
There were a colorful array of accounts , performances , games , exhibition gaps , and information about the Roman era and its importance to the Rhineland .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighting force of the Gladiatorum School , which used every rain pause to demonstrate its robust combat customer with soft-sand .
Gladiatorous " Leonders " turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentor , sending his men into the ring of the heroic second-round struggle in different Gladiatorum bombings .
First , the " provocators " were on the line of legality and short-score , as well as on leftist leagues and those on the right .
The " Essedarii , " with breast chicken , short selling and wording , as well as iron gladiatorenhelm , federal and custom protection .
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the " retiarius , " which arrived at the worker 's web , dack , and slouch against the " Secutor " and , after a recent fight , broke the burner .
Since the heavy-handed metallic scoundrels , the scoundrels , and the worm flown through the arena that fear and gangs could be scratched around the health of the gladiators .
But the impotent " Summa Rudi , " the muscular referee , " had an ever-attentive eye .
" We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman Council of Rome enforceable , " explained Lorence Euskirchen , Chairman of the " Federal Speaker Rome Canal , " the intention beneath the spectacle .
After two years of preparatory time , the leisure park became , for a day , an " Oppidum Romanum , " a Roman city , as Vice Chamber Claus Wehage of his ruin noted .
After all , the Romans have not only fought war and conquest in our region , but also the Roman culture and many structures that we still admire today .
Outsiders were also vocal on holiday , such as " aquädukt-marmor " of the 11 meters high and 1,400 feet long Römer 's bridge , which once stood at the hill .
Frontline society once and now confronted water and energy supplies , and CEO Petra Friends knew , " We are still reaping benefits from the knowledge of then . "
This also confirms diplomat engineering Ralph Heiler of the " Engineering Twin " of Rhine , which produced measurements tools for the Romans , such as Chobat , Groma , or Dioptra .
The Blankenheim Rövillas presented scales and models of the extinctions in 1894 , as well as brick stones from the original mortgage , the wastewater fertilization that once heated the Roman river villas .

In 2011 , the office of memorial males at Rheinland had buried the remnants of a Roman villas in the commercial park Nord in Rheinband .
They have found magnifications of an economic building with a Darre for drinking grain and painting .
The edifice probably had become a villa Rustica , a agricultural commodity , explained the archaologist Dr. Jennifer Morpher .
A series of bases out of these expressions presented them in a fiber-vitrine , including a large plate , several flash vessels , and parts of a mature half-chain .
The viilla probably existed from the first until the fourth century after Christ , until the incursion of the Germanys in the Roman Rhineland , is suspected of killing .
Children also studied the Roman windmills game similar to today ’ s refrigerator pipes , or they wrote their names with metal flashpoints .
At the rubble ’ s rank thermal , the children were allowed to flee mosaics , bag glass mosaic at the level of the glass museum , and scratch a bladder of sun at the level of the natural crum , and bomb a heavy wheat feed in stone for a bowl or a mob .
With two cold blood-soaked originally retrofitted rice boxes , visitors overcame the leisure park , and overcame the impressive state of urban high school , representing the results of their " Rome Project week . "
With a wheel week on September 13-21 , the Joint Day will also be brought to the Rhineland year 2014 , intended to mark the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 .
Together with the home and history clubs , the leaflet of Wandering clubs , the partnership association , and the Laish-Games are also offered in mathematics , a lecture , cooking , and school-cut-cutter leadership , and remembering whispers in the Roman past .
For example , a Roman legislator is told by his work on the greedy lease , that plants are a living monument from the Roman season , and that offered a ludicrous hour of international accommodation between a group of laughters " Germana " and tangled Romans .

Ebola : The Epidemic Burdens West Africa ’ s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
Markets are orphaned , and international companies are at a distance .
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealt a severe blow to West Africa ’ s economy .
Harvest eradicates on fields that rely mines and the markets orphaned - the virus has made it difficult for the region to grow .
Some international companies , too , are already at a distance .
" The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , " the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
The hardest Trouble for Liberia
" It is an utter disaster ; we lose a lot , " says Alhaji Bamogo , who sells clothes in Liberia 's second-largest market in Monrovia Kleisure .
The market depends on who wants to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola .
Liberia is hardest hit by the virus , with more than 600 people killed by fever alone .
Recently , health authorities announced that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country .
The virus also spread in Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Nigeria .
In total , more than 1,500 people died , and thousands more were accumulated .
Foreign Companies Run Workers
Throughout the resource-rich countries , firms operate .
Foreign companies such as Arcelor Mittal , a steel company , are withdrawing employees , and several international airlines are no longer hurting regions .
Domestic traders and farmers , too , are responding : few merchants leave their homelands to occupy afterwards .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , quarantine issues , including export cocoa and coffee stoves .
Farmers dare not leave home for the harvest of crops .
Food Confronts
" People will travel less and less , " Phillipe De Vreyer says Paris experts on West Africa 's economy .
For example , the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables preferably stays home .
The population is thus feeling the impact of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is running out .
In markets , the supply of staple foods like rice is disappearing .
At the same time , the region , heavily dependent on international firms , is at risk of images – with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international firms will essentially shun the area for a long time , says Filipink Hugon of France ’ s Think Tank Iris .
The key is how far and how long the virus will spread .
" It is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Liberia , " Hugon warns .
The disease also strains states ’ strained budgets .
The disease also strained states ’ already-stretched national budgets .
The rating agency Moody 's fears that its budget will be heavily strained by high health-care spending and the deteriorating economy .
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the affected countries ’ health systems of $ 60 million ( $ 45 million ) .
The impact is apparent even in Nigeria , where so far few Ebola cases have been diagnosed .
To be sure , the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected .
But many people elsewhere remain afraid of contagion at home .
Reservations in hotels are also falling sharply .

Bulgaria ’ s Jailers Protesting nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest before the justice ministry in the capital , Sofia .
In the peaceful demonstration , they reiterated their calls for a restoration of their old working conditions , which were recently changed .
Higher salaries are also on a scorecard to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov .
Officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month , calling for a return to the former 24-hour classes .
Despite the prison workers ’ union meeting with representatives of the Justice Department , no agreement was reached , the national Bulgarian Ratio ( BNR ) registered .
The negotiations take time , the Director-General told Rosen Zhelyazkov to conduct punitive measures .
Protest by prison workers is likely to be supported by members of the interior ministry ’ s union of staff workers .
Ukraine ’ s Army abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine , pro-Russian fighters remain on the rise .
Today , Ukraine ’ s army , Monday , has abandoned the airport of the rebel Hansk , reportedly participating in Russian tank battalions as well .
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn personnel consequences from his army ’ s heavy defeat in the struggle against the separatists , and had announced changes in the top army leadership without detail .
Prorussia Separatists Sleet Airplane

NATO Won ’ t Want to Convert Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis in Eastern Europe .
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO abided by the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997 .
The head of NATO , however , accused Russia of " a sharp break " from the agreement .
" Today , we must face reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner , " he says .
Dodocuments and statements from Russia 's side highlight " that they view us as opponents . "
A Stronger NATO presence
Race Muslims have also announced that they want to strengthen NATO ’ s presence in Eastern Europe .
A " Readiness Action Plan " at the NATO summit in Wales would ensure that , " as long as necessary , Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday .
Kiev and Moscow agree on New Gas Talks

Finally , EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had been brokered between the two sides .
Ukraine had warned that Russia could interrupt gas supplies for Europe as well .
Europe gets about one-third of its gas from Russian sources , much of which goes through Ukraine .
Merkel speaks of power : Take “ Full Sense ”
Now the German Chancellor is committed to doing so clearly .
But it is not a free pass for all the complex details .
The CDU ’ s persistent concerns against the PKMD have become increasingly acute .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , after persistent opposition from her CDU , has spoken of a term of power as the introduction of a Pew Mase .
" To put it bluntly , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come , " the Party ’ s chairman said on Monday after the CDU ’ s top meetings in Berlin .
But Merkel did not , for the time being , commit himself to a detailed model .
" Determined parameters " are called in the Black Red Government Program .
federal transport minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) has made a " proposal , and it is now working on . "
The NRW CDU , however , insists on its No to watch all streets .
Merkel has emphasized that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) has been constructive in advocating legislation .
Beyond the issue , he has spoken with Dobrindt about other ways to stimulate more private capital to invest in infrastructure , including broadband .
" There is nothing great about it . " Schäuble had made a " mirror " report uncommissioned on Sunday , his house audits its own concept to pay windfall profits for highway investors after the 2017 election .
Horst Seehofer , the head of the CSU , has warned against developing Mautconcepts against the leading minister .
CDU Federal Armin Laschet reiterated his objections .
" The Coalition Treaty never expected to support all the town and federal streets , " said North Rhine-Westphalic CDU chairman .
As a result , it is an important signal that sea combatants have now announced that they will speak again about the issue .
Opposition to the plans comes from the CDS federations of Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland Pfalz .
Concerns are that watching small borders with neighboring states will be a backdrop .
Sea courts had demanded coalition loyalty for the tongues of the CDU .
The left sees plans as failing in the face of the Union dispute .
" The Murdoch Mill is dead , " Party Chairman Bernd Riexinger said of the " New Osnabakers newspaper " ( Monday ) .
" The minister fails , " and Dobrindt wants to introduce a veto duty on all German roads to start in 2016 .
But , according to the Coalition Treaty , domestic automakers must not be added to the burden .
Thus , through the CFR tax they are supposed to receive a full balance for watching .
But , according to EU law , the model should not be allowed to disadvantage foreign drivers for nationality .
Genetic Disorder Out
One British says that she thought was dying for many years as a result of misdiagnosis .
Karin Rodger lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease .
Indeed , it suffered from the Charcot-Marot disease ( CMT ) , a group of inherited disruptions that damage nerves outside the brain and background .
Charity CMT UK has said that misdiagnoses are a common problem with people with CMT , because so little is known about the disease .
About 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are likely to suffer from CMT , which can lead to motor disorders such as muscular weakness , insecure ticking , and rubble .
Evil feelings or pain also suffer , and the disease is incurable and progressive , implying that the symptoms are getting worse over time .
When Rodger was 13 , she believed that she was suffering from Friedman ’ s ataxy ( FA ) – a disease with a very poor chance of survival .
Rodger thought she would sit in the roles before she would die 18 and die before her 30th birthday .
The mother of two , who is now 51 , said : " As a child , I knew I couldn ' t do the same thing as the other .
I fell steadily , and everything lasted longer with me .
I have never been able to walk with the other children , or to scateboat , often because of my way of going and running in school .
Rodger said that , at age 13 , she saw her medical act as her doctor left the room and reading her FA , after several operations to relieve her Achilles and horror her feet of her feet .
" I felt guilty because I had been curious , so I didn ' t say that , but I went home , searched for the library 's disease , and wrote to FA society , " she said .
When I got the answer , I was shocked and terribly panicked .
I thought that with 18 , I would die with 25 , and then lose all my skills slowly .
I did it alone with me , and I planned my own funeral .
She said when she became 17 , she became clear that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined , and asked her doctor .
He simply stood up , and said , " My love , I don ' t think you 't , otherwise you are already in the roles . "
I believe you are something much less life-threatening .
After some genetic tests , their CMT was found .
" When he told me what CMT was , I felt that I was a bystander , " she said .
Charity CMT UK launched a CMT-Awarenage month to highlight the disease .
For example , since the closure of the former troop standard , D. Berni Diether has been working as a firebuyer .
Nearly ten years have not shot at the former troop stage in coins .
Nevertheless , every month , imunition that kills is occurring at the heart of the biosphere area of pregnant Alb .
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they must be broken down on the ground .
A deafening gallery resonates with the dividends at the heart of the biosphere area .
In December 2004 , the last sharp shot at the troop department was covered up after 110 years of military operation in late 2005 .
Since then , the 6500 hectares have been the centerpiece of the biosphere area of pregnant Alb , opened up to 13 paths for whites and cyclists .
Washington Business Managers ’ Tax Burdens Grows Economic Recovery
Recovery means more customers , more sales , and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
Government and local fiscal modest domestic companies rose slightly last year , while economic recovery accelerated , a newly published study last week , and firms in Washington were no exception .
District , Maryland , and Virginia companies together paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local authorities in 2013 , up 3.8 % from 2012 revenues of $ 26.6 billion .
The government and local corporate tax burden rose by 4.3 % last year , to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 % a year earlier , and it was the third year after several years of decline in the 2009 and 2010 .
Government taxes rose more than local taxes , by 4.3 % , according to the study conducted by the service-sector Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation , a tax group .
Business taxes account for more than half of the district ’ s tax revenue , 56 % , while 36 % of Maryland ’ s revenue comes from companies .
Virginia receives the lowest tax revenue from companies , at 28 % .
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate real-estate values , say , researchers , resulting in a 3.7 % increase in real-estate taxes this year , with growth rates of less than 1 % , after the three consecutive years .
While much of these profits have come from large states like California , New York , and Texas , the process seems to be true in Washington as well .
District , Maryland , and Virginia companies together paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 – a 4.2 % increase over the course of a year .
But the apparent rebound in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenue , as real-estate taxes amount to nearly one-fifth of companies ’ modest tax revenues .
Virginia and D. C. companies pay almost half of their government and local taxes through real-estate taxes .
" This is what happens in Maryland : much of the real estate , especially in the tax area by D. C. , is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations , " said Douglas Lindholm , the head of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland is thus forced to rely much more on , say , income taxes to provide the same services that other states provide .
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be expected solely of the rebound in the housing market .
Corporate income , according to the data , also seems to be recovering .
Companies in the region reported income taxes by state organizations of $ 2.3 billion , up from $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland collected $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest in the region .
While the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies does not rise evenly in all three places .
The District ’ s rate of increase was 4.3 % the national average , while Maryland ’ s growth was much higher , 4.9 % .
Only Virginia reported a subpar tax base of 4.1 % .
Virginia , at 6 % in all three branches , has by far the lowest corporate-income tax rate ( all three have fixed corporate tax rates ) .
Maryland ’ s corporate tax rate is 8.25 % and relatively high 9.975 % in the district .
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia requires lower government and local corporate taxes and overall a better tax climate than Maryland .
The district was not studied in the study .
Despite the benefits , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year , from 6.9 % to 6 % , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 % next year .
If the government continues to achieve its income targets next year , the law could reduce the government ’ s corporate-income tax to 3 % by 2017 .
Meanwhile , the small business in Washington seems to be doing better , and thus pay more government and local taxes , the latest study argued .
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen -- a transitional structure according to which most small companies are organized -- grew by 20 % in the district , Maryland , and Virginia last year , to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole .
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in general entitlement tax revenue for the government and local governments by 6.2 % over the first three quarters of 2014 , compared to the same period of last year .
Nevertheless , Washington could lag behind if the federal government ’ s spending cuts affect the region ’ s labor market .
Partnerships : German Bite for Guangzhou
Hopens and Malz – a popular combination , too , in China .
Germany ’ s beer has an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt ’ s partner city in China now wants bravery , and is also hoping for an air direct connection between the two cities .
Germany ’ s Bier , a friend of Frankfurt ’ s partner city of Guangzhou , is China ’ s urgent desire .
" We would be pleased if German bravery were to settle in our town , " said Vice Party Secretary of China 's Metropolis of South China , Li Yiwei , to visit the SPD delegation in his city this week .
Over and over again , the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party has resigned as part of the talks on this 12-millionth metropolis concern .
Lanzhou , who is also called Kanton in Germany , was one of China ’ s richest cities .
So people also had the purchasing power to afford German beers .
Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer Gümbel , who led the German political delegation , told the host that he would listen to Germany as a possible partner for the project .
" It doesn ' t take much for beer : good water , grain , and pleasure , " he added in lunch with the Party 's headquarters in Guangzhou .
Mr. Li , who flattered the host , was already mourning for his life .
In response , Guangzhou 's official met with Schäfer-Gümbel , but with a red wine used to serve food .
The Chinese Tsingtao brand is based on German Braukuni .
Ttasingo beer is breasted after Germany ’ s purity bid .
More Business Excise
A second desire by China ’ s hosts would be a airline direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , Vize-Party leader Li said .
The Lufthansa had earlier offered the run , but eliminated it for economic reasons in 2012 .
" It would be worthwhile , " became convinced by local politicians .
" Business travel between our two cities continues to grow . "
Right now , travelers would have to take the way around Changsha in Hunan province , Li sued .
Guangdong province administration , whose capital , Guangzhou , is also hoping for the airline connection .
provincial Vice Governor Chen Yunxian emphasized this desire when talking to the Social Democrats .
" This is a very good idea , " said Schäfer Gümbel , the Chinese deputy minister , Li Jinjun , an intimate Kenyan , nodded in agreement .
Trading Partnership
Guangzhou ’ s vice leader hopes that he will visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year .
Li Yiwei was already at the Main , but not yet in that function .
He came to power only this year , after his predecessor was ousted on corruption charges .
Wan Qinglian , the local leader , also had to go .
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the Party and the administration , enforced with harshness by leader Xi Jinping .
The new leader , Li Yiwei , had worked for an American company before his party careers , which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party .
Before taking office in Guangzhou , he was a top official in Fujian , where the highway VW was built .
Frankfurt has officially done more than a dozen urban partnerships .
The connection with the 9,000 kilometers away from Guangzhou is one of those used by both sides with a student exchange .
Last year , the 25-year bidding of the Chinese-German relationship was celebrated .
The South China Metropolis of Pearl are almost as obsessed with economic power as they are .
Next year , it planned to achieve a GDP of € 250 billion , Li reported .
Joan Rivers \ u0027s Family
Joan Rivers has been unaware of her hospital in New York City three days ago , but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her disease .
" Thank your continuing love and support , " Melissa Rivers said in a split today .
We are all depressing the thumbs .
Her mother was supplied to the mount Sinai hospital by sources on Donnerday after an emergency for cardiac shutdowns in a clinic of Upper East Side , Yorville Endoscopy .
Doctors deliberately keep them segregated and scrutinize them until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs that continues to be described as " serious . "
The reaction came from many sides , including an overwhelming online export of Donald Trump , Montel Williams , and Kelly Ripa .
Environmental Football and Rising Wage
Environmental standards will be stricter in automobiles and dust builders who trade today .
Like refrigerators and washing machines , new storage builders get a label on which the buyer can see key data like the device ’ s energy efficiency .
New cars are found in the pollutants ' " euro 6 " classes .
There is also more money for the rubric growers : receiving a federal minimum wage of $ 10.25 .
Amazon buys $ 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday : the online retailer and video producer , and a host of other things , is buying the “ video distribution service ” Twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected to take over Twitch , but because YouTube was widely assumed to buy the company .
Three months ago , Twitch ’ s sale to Google ’ s video service seemed like a billion things done , and cooperation seemed natural .
Twitch , founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was a general seminary – a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for players seeking to publish their hostages in games , " YouTube for Life Games , " an insiders said .
The Twitter interfaces .
And " let ' play , " a video genre in which beautiers give games ( usually older ) a respite of secretive theater , is already popular with YouTube .
It is just that YouTube is often mentioned if Twitch is to be described , so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch has been lured up something , a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube failed , because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon was .
All we know now is that Emmet Shear , President of Twitch , says , " We chose Amazon , believing in our community , sharing our values and long-term visions , and helping us get there faster . "
Another secret , honestly , is Twitch ’ s incredible success .
Snobs like me who declare that they are sports rather than watching find it difficult to understand the attraction that assumes that others should watch the games rather than take charge of themselves .
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 p.m. , one thing , tomorrow , as she is easily shot by President Evil , and another to watch a spinner walk at his head 20 times in Call of Duty .
All of these games may now be watching .
Another problem is that many of today ’ s most popular games are ego games , so without their own control over the perspective , admission can be a really good recipe for headache .
I admit that the fast-track trajectories in which our electronic age ’ s Roger Bannisters complete record matches are entertainable .
But , until gamble or human cyberspace is there , its Twitter channel is probably not so much interesting .
But what skeptics like me know ?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month , and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic jams .
And how , exactly , does Amazon want to make money from it ?
It is hard to imagine Twitch being integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed .
But Twitch has something that every corporation wants : thousands of young men who are promoted as advertisers .
As Twitch 's President Shear said , " Amazon and Twitch " both believe in the future of Gaming , " and the medium shows no sign of contraction , not even swallow .
On the hill at the Burggard Basin , much was unanimous on Sunday .
The concept of parenting was correct .
Despite the strong rainforest commission on Saturday , an estimated 1,200 music fans entered the Open-Airfan Fest in the burqa .
At times , the provision had to be stopped .
" This was furious , " said Ron Sem , one of the organizers .
Salzwel light and fun .
Two Spanish words have named Maxim Sakharoi and Ron Sem .
For the Salzwegian Air is said to broadcast brightness the day and the evening through Shows .
Well , no , and fun comes from alone anyway .
This became apparent early on Sunday , when the first visitors visited Air .
The organizers promised one plague for all generations .
And they have .
Around the burgeese supply levels , Salzwegians , as well as guests , were approaching and struggling around the world .
They followed the first live occurrence , caught foot in the pact , enjoyed cool drinks - short : relaxation of pure and pleasure .
And that is convenient for generations .
While one blanket on ceiling on the extremely ticket white sand was on the fire , others blasted on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek , the desert grew on the hill , which was a great magnet for the smaller guests .
But , in child mines , volunteers literally had all their hands to do fully in the sense of the word , to get rid of the urge and to dump imaginative creations into the small faces .
The bigger used the Kickertian , or participated in a skatebod workshop designed by Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel .
Until the big rains came .
Shortly before 17.30 , he boasted on visitors , especially families , searching for wheat and dry .
But the attractiveness of the mainland did not diminish this .
" There were more people than expected , " said Ron Sem , who spoke of " success on the whole line . "
That is why the big party will not resist a repeat next year .
Although content and size must still be worked , Sem made clear about the referendum on Sunday in a first-ever balance sheet .
He said , physically , that the entrance had to be stopped in the interim .
Obviously , the security firm had been buried with too little force .
As a result , some who had already paid defaulted on the hole .
The resonance was very good .
In a first cautious estimate , the Salzwegian co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors gazing in the burqa .
The problems were tone technology .
The Salzwegian Hip-Hap bloc 's `` Nanny Rox ' ' broke their appearance in disarray .
The engineers were unable to create a semi-reasonable soil .
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built , because tents could not be brought to Salzwel for a rice panel .
" Next year , they will be here , " says the organizers .
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than accomplished by visitors .
And so it is bad .
But they have made some mistakes that will be made for the first time , but that will have to be eliminated at the second edition .
The social-networking Facebook , too , has to engage in criticism .
" Sorry , but € 12 , just expect more , " says Melanie Meier on the events side .
" You , unfortunately , have a bit taken over , " Ele Zimmermann says the same place .
Others do not see the initial problems quite so narrowly .
I find it very good that some are not only stupid , but also really try to get things done .
Well , " writes Stephanie Jenne as an amula .
Now , a year remains for the speaker to abandon these criticisms .
New Radom in Berena
This is not expected to happen .
Instead , the ready part of the construction is to be used in the marketplace construction .
The action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the space surveillance rash TIRA is established , the dustbin , known as Radom , is being renovated altogether .
The new cyclist will be slightly smaller than the old one , with a measurable 47.5 feet .
But size remains the world record .
The final step toward completing the new custom is to exchange it .
The upper quarter of the old hill is separated and decoupled with a crash .
Afterwards , the last quarter of the new custom is raised .
To the extent that the weather is involved , the action should take place earlier this week .
The Ice Bucket-Challenge Cale Contracts
Isabelle Roberts from Britain was shot so much when her ice-old water was torn over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face .
The Ice Bucket-Challenge was painfully misguided .
One woman was hospitalized after ridding her down at the Ice Bucket-Challenge so much that she blew her up shale .
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cleared so much when her ice-old water was torn over her head that she injured her face structure .
" Water was so cold that I wrote , and , while I did , my cattle remained simple , " she said to The Mirror .
Ice water is being shaken over the 20-year-olds .
Iabelle Robert ’ s Seconds Before the accident
I wanted to shut down my mouth , but that was not , the cattle was hidden , and then I understood that something was wrong .
My mother and my sister saw it , and almost went on the hook before laugh , but I had to take refuge .
Britain ’ s 20-year-old people were put into the hospital to replenish shale after participating in the viral trend in the Tuesday .
The clip was reduced to Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter .
Do the Burgers soon go back to the cradle ?
Finally , there has been time and again between Burgesh ’ s two wives .
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation .
The late Richard Dimbath , a former chairman of Burgfriend ’ s Burg , led the project in Guédelon , France , as a model for the restoration of the would-be wives .
A year ago , there was no good climate between the Burgers and the Burgfriend 's wounds .
So far , the perspectives have seemed very different on how to deal with the history of the women ’ s Burg and possibly rebuilding .
Now the two camps are moving on each other : talks about collective action should soon be held .
That confirms Torsten Sjöberg ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burgfriend ) on our newspaper ’ s demand .
" I called Mr. Piffl , and suggested that we could once put ourselves together , " says Sjöberg .
In his view , all members of both clubs could move in the future .
That is how quick successes are seen .
Whereas the Burgfriend surrounding the suddenly late Richard Dimbath has until recently envisioned rebuilding the mountain forest , the burgers around Sjöberg are at the forefront of " developing and mining " the money .
Herbert Piffl , who remains Chairman of the Burgfriend , has said that he was pleased .
Since Dimbathi ’ s death , he has hosted the Burgfriend .
A new chairman is to be found in a member assembly in mid-September .
Currently , the clue is roughly 40 members , according to the 74-year-old .
" After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath , we first renounced the uniformity of respect . " This " thought " was needed to consider how it could continue . "
According to Piffl , the new chairman is to go to the Burgesh talks .
Until then , the Burgfriend may also present a current image of sentiment within her grouping .
Today , Piffl says , is not a candidate for the presidency .
" But I am confident that somebody will find it , " he does not want to run for his own apartment in Bad Toil .
The new chairman should be a would-be wife .
The twelve wishes " to continue working with the project . "
The different views on reconstruction are likely to persist soon in Piffl ’ s view .
He rewards Dimbath as a " missionary " who always believed in rebuilding the Burg .
Two similar , advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airliner .
They are a tourist magnet , through high popular participation and voluntary aid workers from around the world .
Piffl : " I , too , was skeptical at the beginning .
But , over time , I have increasingly come to believe that it makes sense to push the project forward , " creating a " single trait " for the flood city .
There is nothing else .
Moreover , Piffl believes , through EU grants , visitors , and potential sponsors .
" The idea of reconstruction does not personally want to overthrow me , " he hopes that the burgue may be moving on that point .
Their goal of first documenting history is " important and good . "
After that , look forward .
Smart Paths to Uni-Teachers
Since the cost to universal textbooks for many students is more than $ 1,000 a year , the fast-secondary student Matroeder became more clever .
He invented a guiding system for books from students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay the sell-off .
" My mathematics book typically costs $ 180 , but I received $ 10 for a semester and a Chick-movie A kek , " said Schroeder , who visited the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
He spent $ 120 .
College production involved , which , on average , spends more than $ 1,200 per year on textbooks and student materials , but that students have different cost-effective options .
Online shops and creative approaches like roeders are increasingly the solution for students .
Gaining textbooks becomes more popular , so students can use a book for a long time , often at a much lower price than buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university journals , has said that the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011 .
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of college books had meddled over the past spring , as Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said .
According to the National Association of College Stores , less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus accountants .
Here is one of the best deals .
Buying Online
Some new books will cost only one-third of the price online for which they are in campus boats .
The ninth " Calculus " vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards , and Robert Hostler cost nearly $ 290 , but can be used for $ 239.99 for the specialized textbook trader Chegg.com .
Buy Up
If one of the notes of other or normal utilities is not another , used books are a good option .
" Calculus " is needed at Chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
Matt Casaday , 25 final students at Brigham Young University , says that he spent on Amazon.com 42 Cents on a spent issue of " Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business Business Business . "
The book was sold for $ 48 .
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey , the head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls , have recommended students to ask their professors whether past spending is permissible .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to seminal work .
In such cases , older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest spending .
Except for Chegg and Amazon , Half.com von eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books .
Miewed
The memoir of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well , think about giving them back , and don ’ t want to keep the books going after the course is completed .
They can save more than 80 % of the cost of a newly bought book .
A student could , for example , rent " Calculus " for about $ 20 in the duration of a semester .
You learn about the provisions of the business with which you rent , including the criminal fees that might fall for writing notes , underwriting , or utilities .
If you don ’ t give back the book , the fine fees may even exceed the price of a new book .
E-Books
E-Books , too , are an option , rather than traditional textbooks .
Sometimes these books are de facto mietry , providing an electronic license for a certain period of big brokers like Amazon ’ s com , Chegg , and Barnes & le Inccus .
At Chegg , you can rent " Calculus " for about $ 61 for 6 months .
Bracey says that literary students often find the best offers , because many classics can be downloaded free nowadays , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
In any case , I look around .
Joe Gault , 29 who is about to visit the Pepperdine Law School , recommends the ISBN number for pricing books , because one can be so sure to find the right textbook .
And , according to Gault , before an online bribery , the book should be assessed .
That lesson arose on the hard way .
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time , and finally paid the full price in college accountants .
Why “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” did not become a barracks
" The Expendables 3 " of Sylvester Stallone played less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while " Sin City : A Dame to Kill " played only $ 12 million of his budget of $ 70 million .
The Cameron diaz film " Sex Tape " played only $ 14.6 million " on the opening week , while infant films like " dragon counts " also disappoints on revenue .
An article by the telecom critic Robbie Collin indicates that children ’ s movies may be the reason for lack of quality in the films themselves .
Collin called 2014 " the worst year " for child movies to date , describing " dragon numbers easily " as " functional " subjects .
For films for a slightly older group , however , it seems that the quality of the film is not necessarily the problem .
In July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic Assessment for every summer ’ s film film film , which was shown to be at least 2,000 embarrasses between America ’ s Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 , and this year ’ s July .
The results are based on the opinions of movie owners and film critics , and indicate that this year ’ s film mits are equal to that of the past year .
Some commentators argue that development stems from changing seed habits and growing popularity among web-distribution services like cyber flux .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney ’ s forthcoming Jungle film , told the Dutch Web site of Hollywood reporters : “ I think times are changing . ”
We must accept this , not try to follow the past .
In contrast to Hollywood manufacturing casualties , netflix recently received $ 1.2 billion in sales , nearly twice the rate of sales last year , up from $ 837 million .
Last summer , the director Steven Gberg criticized the film studies for focusing too much on comics filmmaking and predicting a " meltdown " of Hollywood .
In light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core .
Other film industry representatives are more optimistic , owing to potential carriers , including Avengers : Age of Ultron , Minions , and Jurassic World , to be expected to occur in the summer of 2015 .
The X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in casualties as " cyclical , " telling Hollywood reporters , " that next summer will be the largest summer in the movie Caucasus , and no one will worry more about business . "
This was a step in the right direction a few years ago , when the two Tibetan district classes were eliminated for punishing the Ligen-sharing mechanism .
Now the German Tibetan Association has launched an additional 3 federal league .
As a result , those who have not risen have abated .
For example , although Göttingen ’ s most classified team , Torpedo , has avoided the descent , it is playing only fifth class in the coming season .
Fourth classes remain Torpedo ’ s ladies , despite their grandiose diarrhea into the regional league .
The young and girls of Torpedo died in the subjects league , as did the SC ’ s boys .
The SGC Lengers and the Torpedo Reserve are entering the new Federation League , where the countryside is no longer a gueup club .
In the name of the name , the TTV Geismar plays in the crime league , the torpedo branches in the countryside .
What looks like a better circus layer is now the new district site south .
Here are TSV ’ s oceans , VFB liquebots , Torpedo III , Geismar , Einbeck , Hammenstedt , Bovender SV , pleasure holidays , the FC , and the TC .
The township league plays as a regional representative of the Dransfeld and the SC Weende , in the TTC ’ s district classes , Red White , the Bovender SV II , and the TTV Geismar II team , and III . The district soleague of the layer of the layer , at least , begins in a downturn .
Gone , TTC , and TTV Geismar II are involved with the games .
In the township league , Torpedo III and Sshadow Mountain / wolves went up .
The Nine teams
The SC is sending its girls into the small district league .
Nor is the SCW districts - where Torpedo II is still underway - complete .
In a circular clause , Geismar , Tuspo Weende , and the SV come to the season .
In the first season of the newly established Regional Association , the two guöttinger Kreiges began with every nine teams .
In the West Staffle , the Red Force II , Bovender SV III , Laubach II , Torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , the SC ’ s Dransfelons II , Mielenhausen , and SG Lengers II are II .
In the East Staffle , among other things , switches / wolves , Nikolausberg , and land-shauts play .
The Damen-Kreisk is made up of Sshadow hausen / Wöllmarshausen II , billboards , shirts , nauts II , Tuspo Weende , and the SGC Rhume .
This is still better than Osterode , a circle with no dam teams at all at the circuit level .
Conspicuously , none of the six killers will be able to achieve some strength , with the innovative and transformative leader having to contemplate .
NATO Summit : First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On weekend , there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport .
On Saturday , hundreds of people gathered at the center of Newport as an anti-NATO march .
On Sunday , about 150 people gathered in Cardiff before the city ’ s ethals to hold a so-called counter-summit .
Stephen Fairclough followed developments on the weekend , speaking to those who traveled to Belgium from Bridgedly .
Blue Mountain Teenagers
ZEI ’ s youthful bugs were secured with the soap window , having been trapped over the Blue Mountain ’ s night in the NSW .
DAS ’ s 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man crashed into her tour shortly after Sunday ’ s Day Day Day in Govett ’ s Leap .
Worried relatives called the police at around 20 p.m. , when they did not return home .
An addictive rupture of local police and rescue agencies broke up , and the couple was found at around 23 p.m. near the Bridal Veil .
The girl had been wounded by knees , and the man had overthrew and beat his head .
Bailouts stayed with the couple overnight , and they were flown tomorrow on Monday .
They were provided to Blue Mountain ’ s Hospital in a stable state with a hospital car .
escalating Anti-Government Protests in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 protesters were forced out of the PTV building , Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said .
After a half-hour , the station resumed radiation after more than half an hour .
PTV ’ s director , Athar Farooq , said that the protestors with spoilers had damaged rumors in the edition .
Kill or injured were not reported .
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the prime minister they accuse of fraud .
The police said that , around a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence , they had witnessed another assault on Monday of roughly 3,000 protesters with security forces .
After hospital testimony , a policeman was injured .
At least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured on weekend , as demonstrators tried to sweep into Sharif ’ s residence .
They are demanding that the prime minister step down .
The powerful military , on Sunday ’ s evening , called for a political solution to the conflict “ without time to waste and use force . ”
" The army remains committed to its role in ensuring state security . "
The escalating violence has fueled concerns about military intervention , which in the past has already been more common .
The protests led by opposition leader Imran Khan and Prime Minister Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the Independence Day on August 14 .
Sharif rejects resignation .
Khan and Qadri called on their followers to stay on Sunday .
" We will not retire without forcing Sharif to resign , " Khan said .
Qadri made a similar statement .
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May by cheating .
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
An interim government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
More than 40 thousand security forces are deployed to protect the government ’ s districts .
The protesters had initially shut down peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on the weekend to reach out to Sharif ’ s residence .
Shews villages ranked three tobacco rooms after the second season victory .
With 2 : 0 above Green , Rapid finished a bitter week on Sunday .
" Victory is very liberalizing , " said Trainer Zoran Barisic , whose team reached a jendbox with the European League in Donbas Day .
" The success story was uncanningly important , " confirmed Captain and Torprotector Steffen Hofmann , who finished third with Green white .
Schram trauma brings Rapid to victory on Road , with the second season victory , the right response to disappointment with Helsinki , and goes to the country ’ s pause with a success experience .
" We wanted to take a positive response , " said Foreign Defenders Thomas Schrammel , who , with his malign leader from the Sixteenth Check , put the scene on a victory .
“ I thought I hau had all the frustration of Donbas Day and sneered him among the Latvians , ” said the 26-year-old .
That was true of Ried when the last stroke on November 13 , 2010 , hit in a federal league article .
Thus , the first championship provider in Rapid-Dress will be him in special memory .
" That is something special for me , I 'm out of the Rapid offspring , " said the fraud .
Mario Pavelic ’ s short-term Becken-Blessur , retrofitting from the left to the right defensive side , made his case very good there , too .
He has had enough experience that he can exercise that position .
He deserved the goal that he has already made some assists this year , " praised Barisic .
Gallup also provided the flank with the 2 : 0 Hofmann , after well an hour that eventually brought the decision .
For before that , guests could have ascribed as well .
" Thanks to God , we have had some luck today , " he also observed , in the last few weeks , to the encounter of performance and results : " The results have not been valid , but the player has always been good compared to last year . "
Barisic even found it " better in many games than it is now " against " the strongest team in this season at that stage . "
The first trip since July 26 showed that , despite the setbacks , the team ’ s structure was intact : “ Today , my team has shown that it is character . ”
For him , not least , pleasure : " That we have finally been playing back to zero . "
Much work during the game of countries is also the fact that Brian Behrendt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar , and Michael Schimpelsberger have several cases to complain , and Srdjan Grahoc , Stefan Stangl , and Philipp Schobesberger have made victory even more valuable .
" Don ' t forget this , " Barisic , who has lost over the past three days with Behrt and Pavelic players , " exhorted " the most stable of late . "
The country gamble must thus be used to " shine wounds and put a little in the physical field , " Barisic said , who has five U21 selection workers in his ranks .
One who is most likely to come from recess is Hofmann .
He is torn apart for the team , about pain .
At this very moment , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , " a controlled barisic .
Hofmann not only provided Rapid ’ s game before he switched to the 68 minute ; he not only got the structure , but also reached the second goal .
For the 30th anniversary who completed his 35th federal game , it was the first meeting in the game since November 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 above the Admira ) .
Hofmann : " Don ' t believe that everything is good now , " we have certainly had some luck , but at some point luck must come back to us .
Now it 's high time , " Hofmann said .
But he pretended to work too hard : " You can not always see this as black and white .
We have not played as badly in recent weeks as was portrayed .
But we must not believe that everything is good now .
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
It is a very young team that I can now help .
" Hofmann said in certain phases . "
Grand Coach Michael Baur had little to blame for his team .
He regretted the countervailing " from the category of magic , " as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute that referees misappropriately recognized .
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough in some phases .
Because we have had too little conclusions .
Interior defenders , Maximilian Karner , saw a similar point : " It started badly , but then we found ourselves purely , and even made a goal .
By and large , more would have been in the process .
Under this wolf is Ruh
We showed a powerful tribe at our admission to the summer series " my piece of good fortune " last Friday .
Several of these cottage giants still exist in the countryside , with educated specimens above the " scourges " of street bridge .
A bumpy football route leads to the roughly 600-year-old marriage .
There is no point in double bases , baseline buildings , and bases .
A brick beneath the building freeze , a kilometer north of the street after Christmas , is standing .
Vital looks like a natural memorial , stretching beyond the other trees of the environment , and reminiscent of an American mammalian tree on a scale more than eight feet .
A small buddha on a farm suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But , despite intensive research , there was only hints of name origin .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the extra beef Archiv , and asked the elderly , from underground conflagration , to discover what it has to do with the scourge .
The result of his research was the rather sober explanation for the name .
So , until about 80 years ago , brick herders are said to have driven their animals from underground bridge to the painstakes who had been liberated by stones .
On the cotton ’ s foot , the animal cohorts exhausted by the rise are reported .
Now the field has regained its relevance , because on the Vienna , the brick fields actually resurface .
Moreover , the field has been declared a core biosphere reserve zone , with Schneider continuing to find out .
But there should be caution in the concrete concrete of the crowd gatherings , because the sun ’ s warm base is also a popular residence for Crusaders .
A migratory journey leads from underground bridge to the tree , but it is hidden .
Further paths have been outlined , rising in the direction of high polio , inviting widespread migration .
What ’ s Water ?
But one water searching for our next task is unlikely to find much .
Grassroots mirror already gives a good sense of construction , but in the countryside we have some of the historic constructs to which the building confederation could fit .
Where is our " piece of good fortune " ?
My Breath of Happiness
As with earlier Main Post series in recent years , prices this year must be restored if they have the right solution .
Those who wish to photographer themselves can also join .
Under the e-mail address this new town , @ mainpost.de , you can end the solution , and you , too , can end the “ piece of good fortune , ” in this lens .

According to weeks of tumult , Italy ’ s prime minister and acting EU foreign policy leader , Matteo Renzi , enforced the nomination last week of his EU Special Summit of Secretary of State Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy , and will succeed the British Catherine Ashton .
Renzi , like the government ’ s nearby daily newspaper La Repubblica , regards the appointment of Mogherini , who is also in the governing team as a favorite , as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU .
He also expects a boost to his " reform package " in Italy .
Last but not least , Renzi hopes to quiet the leftist base that he has defied , because Mogherini will be assigned , albeit more moderately , to it .
Poland , Donald Tusk , the Conservative Representative of Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Council ’ s president , nominated Donald Tusk , declared Rome ’ s dominant position to make political balance .
For the EU ’ s chief diplomacy is simultaneously a deputy of the Commission President Juncker .
The EU Parliament ’ s outgoing approval is considered safe .
Otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41year-old leader of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) a " important " acceptance " of Italy 's role in the EU .
La Repubblica 's widespread optimism that the Mogherini , who has been living in leading party offices for nearly two decades , has been able to grow up to " huge challenges " for her ambitions .
The native wheat is married , and has two daughters .
Their party careers began the completed political scientist Margherita ’ s Youth Organization in 1996 , at the time Democratici di Sinistra ( leftist Democrats ) , which coalesced with the Catholic centrist Margherita party today ’ s Social Democratic PD .
In 1999 , Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth ( European Jewish Socialists ) .
With the election in 2001 in the Left Democrats ’ Party Council , she entered high party politics , working in foreign policy , which soon became head of the left .
It has traditionally focused on Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East , known by studies of NATO ’ s use in Afghanistan in which Italy is involved in a contingent of forces , cultivated contacts with Europe ’ s social democrats and with US Democrats .
Since 2008 , it has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies in which it is an expert on defense and international affairs .
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014 , he advised Mogherini as his secretary of state .
If the PD has a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which contributed more than 40 % of the party ’ s vote in May ’ s EU elections , it has , as PD shows , participated in Federica Mogherini .
Attempts in Brussels that the EU ’ s new foreign ministers have too little diplomatic experience , lacking substance , are converted to the PD .
In Brussels , especially Poland and the Baltic members , thirty-realistic accente Mogherini is being persecuted into the crisis in Ukraine and discredited as a " rubber-friendly course . "
It supports the pipeline South Stream , run by Russia ’ s gas company , to be transported directly to southern Europe via Ukraine ’ s bypassing of Russian gas , which also serves Italy ’ s energy security .
After Renzi took office as EU President in July , Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit .
Photographs showing them at Shake-hands with Putin were indignant in Brussels , just as they invited the Kremlin ’ s chief of economic summits for October to a Milan .
Total nine young people began their training at embryonic Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday .
This is an azubi that has already completed a different education in the company .
In four schools , the new employees will work in the future : electronics ( three training ) , Mechatronics ( two ) , toolbox mechanics ( two ) , and procedural mechanics ( two ) .
All avenues come from the countryside : Tobias ’ s Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach , Stefan Brickl , and Florian residuals from Smidgades , John Beer of Neunbourg , and Colonel Domaier from Colonel Villaim , Daniel Sorgenfree , and Sebastian from Ponzi , as well as from Tedinand Ferdand in Streunboz .
The new training programs had previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools , respectively .
From Wednesday to Friday , the educators of all millennia , as well as teaming instructors , travel to high assembly , where , among other things , full immigration and rehabilitation on the Indian program are on the agenda .
The company counts 435 workers in Germany and 950 worldwide .
The number of instructors is spread across all millennia .
The Socialists in France were to " keep quiet and put France in order , " said the most important ally of Francois Hollande .
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show " their love " for the controversial Socialist president , whose cabinet reformation was met with disapproval by the large majority of French .
The president deserves all the respect , deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
" It is our duty to stay side with him , " he said on great applause .
As an appealing gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government will not challenge the controversial 35-hour week in France , despite strong calls to relax the rule of Emmanuel Macrons , the new economy minister .
On Saturday , Mr. Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show themselves " united " with the government .
But Christiane Taubira , the justice minister , dispatched sand into the wheels of a rogue Socialist MP and criticized the Socialist Party for taking “ faith in its future . ”
Marine Le Pen , the far-right National Front leader , mocked the Socialists ’ constant infighting , and said that she could not imagine the new Valls government continuing for more than a few months .
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes , but neither is Prince Manuel Valls , who is forced to form a new government unless the old one summer survived .
" Nor will the new ones survive the autumn or winter , " said Fräulein Le Pen to supporters .
She reiterated her party ’ s call for parliamentary dissolution , and said she was confident that she would emerge victorious in early elections , and be willing to lead to government .
France ’ s ruling party was defeated in the municipal elections in March , and the right-wing National Front was leading in May ’ s EU elections .
A poll in the Sonday Journal du DiSome found that 76 % of French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande ’ s 2017 .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po University , warned that if the new Socialist government does not want to improve the economy and restore records , the French would quickly lose patience .
" There is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel fast that things are changing , " he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could worsen further .

pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the vote .
A peer loyalty group nearby the Chinese flag .
The National People ’ s Congress ’ s permanent committee adopted a Framework on Sunday , allowing only two or three candidates to take the lead in Hong Kong in 2017 .
All candidates must first gain the majority support of a nominating committee , which is likely to be staffed with pediatric members .
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote , leading pro-democracy activists to maintain their threat and , with " Occupy Central " protests , silence Hong Kong 's financial square .
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong ; and China ’ s leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
Following the release in June of a Beijing White Paper depicting China ’ s hegemony over Hong Kong , pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the process of voting to the Special Administration , with hundreds of thousands marching in the city ’ s business districts and organizing a session there .
Li ’ s survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and China ’ s obligation office in Hong Kong .
Throughout the day , Deputy Chair of the State Council of the Legal Commission , Zhang Rongshun , and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Affairs and Macaus of the State Council , Feng Wei , should be consulted .
Student activists announced that they would gather at the afternoon before the office of Hong Kong 's top leadership .
Britain had no democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong .
Putin calls for Kiev to accept " State Talks " with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the country 's separatists in the east and engage in direct negotiations on " statehood " in the breakaway region .
His spokesman , Dimitri Peskov , later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the Russian-speaking region of eastern Ukraine ’ s separatists would become part of Russia , but that his status with Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests .
Putin ’ s call to the Kyiv government for negotiations fits with pro-Russian insurgents , however , seems to fit the strategy he has pursued since the riots began five months ago : help separatists take territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow Novorossiya de facto independence to become an alliance with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with the state television channel , Putin denounced Ukraine ’ s military campaign to re-conquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Crimea in Ukraine on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the acquired area the " Novorossiya " or " neo-Russia , " a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who are " trapped in their illusions " during Ukraine 's campaign for elections on the 26 th century , and while government groups hope to attack civilian communities in separatist-held areas .
" We need to start early talks not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there , " he said .
Peskov said that Putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy , which Kiev has been debating for months to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights are at risk .
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories , Peskov said .
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov said , " because the conflict is not between Russia and Ukraine , but about internal conflict in Ukraine . "
To clarify the Kremlin 's " misreading " of Putin 's remarks underscored Russia 's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea , where the majority of the two million ethnic Russians are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians , and pre-conflict polls showed a wide majority for remaining in Ukraine .
The autonomy expressed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give Ukraine ’ s regional governments full authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively giving the Kremlin control over an area that links Russia ’ s territory to Crimea .
The Black Sea Peninsula , annexed five months ago , is the savior for most of Russia ’ s navy and a major trading port and historical coastal region .
The regions between Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines , factories , and gunships that make important components for the Russian military .
In his June 7 inauguration speech , Ukrainian law , Petro Poroshenko , proposed – after a new election – amendments to the constitution granting the areas greater control over their finances and language status .
But his conception of autonomy seems in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels accused of arming and overseeing Moscow .
Putin ’ s last call for Kyiv to negotiate eyebrows with the separatist leaders came after another campaign by the rebels last week , after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine through the previously peaceful region along the ASoviet Sea .
Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasowsk , who , according to Ukrainian security officials ’ fears , is the first step in a campaign to acquire the strategic coastal region through Crimea .
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have been used to consolidate Mariupol , a steel industrial port of 500,000 people who lies between Novoasowsk and the meager access to the Crimea Peninsula .
At a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday , Poroshenko urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
" We are on the verge of a point where there is no return , " Poroshenko warned .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine ’ s territory .
The EU summit did not take concrete action , requiring further sanctions against Russia to take effect in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajjsk , after two Russian tanks tons and 1,000 troops roiled into the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists , Colonel Andrij Lysenko , Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security Council , and Defense Council ( NTC ) reporters in Kyiv on Saturday .
Lysenko distributed on Sunday , probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by Russia ’ s Ilowajsk incursion , for 10 Russian parachutes captured in Ukrainian territory on Sunday .
Naktfotoskscandal surrounding Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not heed his anger at hackers , who probably stolen naked images from Hollywood for his prayers , Gabi Grecko , and who is who stolen from Hollywood .
The city is exciting after a series of clear photographs of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hackingscandal surrounding online celebrities .
The hackers responsible for this may have 60 nackbootos by Lawrence Star , " the Tribute of Panem , " including superstars , the Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne , the rank of Rihanna , Ariana Grande , and Lea Michelle , and the actress of Kirsten Dunst .
Among the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer , Emily Browning , Yvonne Strahovsky , and Melbourne Grecko , private photos were reportedly also published on an iloud void .
The list is 101 .
Edelo , who bowed to Grecko last month , told Confidential , said , " It 's wrong . "
All private letters and images should remain private .
One shame is that private information can be stolen and passed on to others .
Grecko , now in New York , reportedly told a news website that the taste is " shameful , " and that those involved felt " injured . "
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer , with her former friend , Scott Speedman , including two images of her above without a pool .
Palin 's filmworks include " love is invincible " with Liam Hemsworth .
Palmer , Chuck-Star Strahovsky , and the actress Browning of Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on hated images .
As one representative of Lawrence said to TMZ , " It is a lofty violation of privacy . "
Gambler Seth Rogen denounced the hacker in his tweet : “ To trump images of a cell phone is nothing short of selling chickens . ”
In purely legal terms , more stolen images should not be tolerated .
Yesterday , Radler , Joggers , and others were yesterday at the Great Feldberg , supporting the forgiveness of " Cancer Children . "
The tour , for which one tumor culture was one , was easy training for the other .
But everyone agreed on one thing : it fun .
Thomas Studanski may well have slept last night .
For for the first time in his life , the chief of the upper house of the council was yesterday on the field .
For the good reason .
He can easily slip away from the small muscle caregivers , given that he has personally earned a valuable insight into the Great Feldberg in favor of United " Cancer Children " ( Frankfurt ) .
One thing .
" I now know that I can - prima ! "
Small Polls ?
Nine , once I had stopped , was weary .
Like Thomas Studanski , who sits in the upper house of the city legislature for the CDU , many of the 718 participants in yesterday quashed in the spring and came close to exhaustion , but happily , on the field .
Others , by contrast , found it easier to overcome the well-11 kilometers between high and field .
Norman Dietch , for example .
The Green Politicians of the Kreig - Red Bike - who began the rotation made some of the statement ( “ Every number of professionals comes ! ! ” ) , then turned out to be half professors on the mountain , and went to 45 minutes without Atemis .
He , too , is stuck in a rubble , as is Nina Kuhn , the city ’ s press secretary who , together with Frank , had embarked on green rocks .
For the two triathletes , the " Feldberg wheels " were not necessarily a sports challenge : " Here is Charity , we like to be in the process - we would have done it anyway , " he says .
As a result , they met Paul Wenzel of the Takenberg .
The boy ( 12 ) was doomed by the morning to summon up the surface .
The morning 's Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swooped into the phrase at 9 p.m. , " making the field two times , and then rolling with fun at home .
So did `` Fritten Toni . ' '
For the Chief Cultural Chief , radar tours of the field simply belong to it .
He had rushed to 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo-race race .
A crazy event .
I 'm happy to do this , " Andreas Balzke said .
The sophisticated corn says that it is an " ambitious retailer . "
He must be , for he was on the way with the " Fixie-Rad , " which is also a rabble-robber , but without shambles ...
That it was uneasy to move up proved not only to the 20 others who rose beyond the White Wall and the Fuel to the summit , but also to a brogger who backfired on a grain of weight .
" I know " from Frankfurt , who trained a special shantytowns to keep his team happy with Alrad bully and Quad , " said : " I know from Frankfurt , who trained him for a specific shantytowns , only to keep the slaughter . " So the man is his own song .
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been put on the scene in the morning .
The other people first came at 9.30 .
The first cyclists and runners followed by 10 p.m.
Five minutes later , the first mountainers laid bare .
Bent Hansen , Chairman of the United " Road on the Great Feldberg , " gave up the launch squads and wished the participants a beautiful foray .
Next year , he hopes that the wayside will be cut back to the safety of the participants .

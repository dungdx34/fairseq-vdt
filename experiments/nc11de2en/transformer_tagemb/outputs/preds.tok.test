Obama Begins Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about implementation of the international agreement , as well as about Iran ’ s destabilizing actions in the Middle East .
But it is also intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution .
Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been tense for years .
Washington criticizes Israel ’ s ongoing settlement construction , accusing Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process .
The Obama nuclear program deal has further deteriorated the relationship between the two .
In March , at the Republican Party ’ s invitation to the US Congress , Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech that was partly viewed as an affront to Obama .
The speech was not talked with Obama ; a meeting had rejected that with hints of Israel ’ s upcoming election .
Professor in a Notruf is told to shoot his girlfriend .
Professor Shannon Lamb told a somewhat quiescent voice from the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials had to get to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his " white dog " was empty and probably excited , and said the dead wife 's family accounts could be found on the cell phone .
Within the house , officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that had been crisscrossed on a white bloc : " I wanted it , I could , I was in retrospect , I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . " This , according to the authorities , was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland , Missississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school volume , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , Emidthan , at the door to his office .
Delta State University of Police Secretary Lynn Buford said that university staff listened at 10 : 18 .
He said that Lamb eventually made the fateful node .
There was another death by the end of the day : Lamm took on life when the police intercepted him .
One day after university shootings forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an image of what motivated Lamb .
The details issued by investigators on both ends of the state , and the testimony of what students and employees they knew helped to read an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
Students said that they were delighted on his teaching .
The police in Gauck , where Prentiss died , said that he has no history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote that he mentioned the " wonderful people " he shared his academic life .
Both went to the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose textbooks comprise 17 members , and many students visited from both .
At the same time , there were some biases to problematic behaviors .
One student , Brandon Beavers , who praised Lamb , said that he also seemed a bit indignant and nervous , " as if something was wrong with him . "
Another student , Micle Sykes , said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic 2014-15 .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for permission for health , saying that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in the university ’ s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic path to hiring as an assistant professor .
University President William Lage said that he didn ' t know of a Lamb conflict , but " of course there was something in Mr Lamb 's idea . "
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
After the flight from Campus , the police later found Lamb ’ s impulse to return to Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he was arrested , Lamb killed himself with a caliber , say , a mile south of his parents ’ house on Greville ’ s outskirts , Mississippi , Washington Corty Methel Johnson .
His car was still at work .
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to the house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and educated geography and pedagogics .
He graduated in pedagogics in the spring .
One of his longtime friends , Lamb , described him as intelligent , charismatic , and lush .
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 , and Lamm was 20 when they met through joint friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the older candle who tried for several years to teach her the gitar game .
He was black women then .
All girls switched when he was there , " Hairston said , now 40 , and in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon .
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together .
In the Notruf , Lamb said , " I killed my wife , " but there was no certificate of marriage .
They had one dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the Backstone House , which came to a Bayou in Gautier .
The police said that the dog was in order .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O ' Steen , said that they had been abandoned 15 years ago , but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
" She was totally destroyed on the ground , " said O ' Steen about his daughter .
They and their mother were absolutely best friends .
O ' Steen said he had never met Lamb , but his daughter , Abigail , told him that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues .
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer ’ s market three years ago .
Later , they played one or the other poison together .
O ' Steen said that his daughter writes and carries her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for a number of companies .
Mike Shaffer , a Barkeeper and sometimes a coordinator of entertainment at The Julep Room , a weak player near Gauck , said that he had the last seen Lamb and Prentiss Night in September 5 , after Lamb ended his gitren and Mundharmony aspiel before a scant audience .
There was no sign that anything was wrong .
“ Just a happy couple , ” he said .
We were on the cleanup and scrambled with each other .
I think they both had a good sense of joking .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminary program and specialized on indigenous Americans and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas , and was President of his Brotherhood and student committee .
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , some 900 people , including teachers , staff , students , and community members participated in a censorship ceremony at the Tuesday .
Schmidt ’ s wife , Liz , and his brother , Jeff Schmidt , also attended the Guard , while the university chair “ Bright Morning Star ” and “ Amazing Grace . ”
Teaching is restored on Wednesday .
" We are trying to get our students back , " he said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of cure .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greville , Missississippi , and Rebecana in New Orleans helped this report .
This story was revised in order to refute that the police now say that Lamb made the Notruf after he shot Smidt , and that while Lamm called his wife in his Notruf Prentiss , there is no indication that the two had ever married .
Toys R & amp ; D ’ s plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys ’ R & amp ; D says that there will not be as many Christmas season workers as there were last year , but toy and baby product dealers say that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country , and 45,000 were hired in the Christmas Age period in 2014 .
Most jobs will be part-time jobs .
The company said that it will start its applicant talks this month , and that its workforce will grow in October to December .
While holidays are still months away , Christmas businesses are moving closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to clean up , sell , send , and sell items .
Michael J. Fox jokes about his " dates " with Princess Diana .
The premiere of " Back to the Future " was professional a moment for Michael J. Fox .
It was also remarkable for personal reasons .
" We sat in the theater wait for the royals , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , " he said in a trailer for an impending documentary Back in Time .
The film begins , and it makes sense to me that I am a silenced guy and a desire away from being with Wales ’ s princess at a dates .
" Back in Time , " a documentation about " Back to the Future , " presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson , and Christopher Lloyd , as well as Director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Gberg .
" Back for the futures " had premiums 30 years ago .
" It 's true for me , " said Gberg , " the " undisputed greatest time film ever made . "
Back in Time , we will see VOD , DVD , and selected movies in October .
Syria ’ s Military Solution
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia ’ s increased military support for Syria is : “ There is no military solution ” to the nearly five-year conflict , and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people .
The UN ’ s leader is once again calling on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet foreign ministers of the Council 's five permanent member nations - the US , Russia , China , the United Kingdom , and France - on the verge of this month 's ministerial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
He regretted that the splits in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers " make this situation unsolvable . "
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity with Iran in managing the crisis .
8 poll numbers show that Donald Trump must be taken seriously .
Some have tried to brand it as a flop .
Others dismissed him as a joke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But , no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper echelon of polls , it has not ( yet ) worked .
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump in double digits , and some are beginning to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate moguls .
Of course , it is still too early in the electoral term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts emphasize that Rick Perron ’ s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain , none of whom even won the nominating process .
And there are many reasons why he is struggling in a general election .
But outsiders like Jeb Bush ’ s Super PAC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump ’ s resilience and beginning to let their dollars flow to topple him .
Here are some recent surveys suggesting that the property mogul is not just a temporary phase :
Trump ’ s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real-estate mogul as positive .
By mid-July , it was 40 % .
By early August , it was 52 % .
Six out of 10 Republicans now hold a positive view of Donald Trump .
Three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
These are early states .
A Quinnipaci vote in Iowa last week found that 60 % of Republicans say Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates .
In a poll by CNN / ORC last week , 67 % of Republicans said that they were either " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if Trump was nominated .
Only two out of 10 say they are " angry " if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson is generating roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 % say they are " enthusiastic , " 40 % who say the same thing about Trump ) .
The Next Measurement ?
Marco Rubio , with only 21 % .
On the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they would be " dissatisfied " or " angry " if Jeb Bush , the establishment 's favorite , were the candidate .
A majority of Republicans do not view Trump ’ s temperament as a problem .
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements , 52 % of Irish voters who leaned to the Republicans believe that the real-estate mogul has the right temperament for a president , according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number is true in the nation ’ s first primate state , Iowa , where the same 52 % of Republicans think he has personality for a commander-in-chief , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 % think he does not have the personality to be effective , and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit the White House , says ABC / Post .
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea .
When they raise their scholars , Republican voters consider Trump real .
When asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination , a poll by CNN / ORC last week said four out of ten that Trump is the best bet .
This has been a change since the time when four out of ten in late July put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : past G-8 voters did not have the crystal ball .
At this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28 % for the final candidate , Mitt Romney .
Yet a large number of GOP voters are showing that Trump ’ s campaign is plausible .
Even when Republicans gather for another candidate , Trump is almost everyone .
Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely to contribute to Trump ’ s leadership , while the anti-trust sport is diffused over a dozen other candidates .
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump is winning majority support .
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina , before Marco Rubio 14 , ahead of Walker 15 , before Jeb Bush , and then ahead of Rand Paul , John Kasia , and Chris Christie 33 .
It is a neck and tie to Ted Cruz .
The only candidate to beat him ?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 in a hypothetical head-to-head race .
A close majority of Donald-Trump fans say that they have grown up .
A new CBS / NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have made their votes firmly .
Of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that it will never change opinion .
46 % said that they let the door open to other candidates .
Yet , for the moment , Trump ’ s most powerful competitor is the other outsider , the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , but voters who say that they have grown up are twice as often for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they are consistent with Trump on immigration .
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico " rapists " two months ago , immigration has been the linchpin of public discourse in 2016 .
Some worry that Trump ’ s bombastic language of critical Hispano Americans will stay away from the Republican Party , damaging the rebalancing effort .
But , after the new ABC / Post Monday poll , six out of 10 Republicans say that they are consistent with Trump on immigration issues .
So , as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Trump seems to be doing the same .
Frustration with the government is climbing to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support of Republican voters , particularly their outsider status .
Six out of 10 Republicans say , in the new ABC / Post Montags poll , they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience .
They are also angry at Washington .
A poll by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Congressional Republicans , 54 % " dissatisfied " and 21 % " polite . "
Munich , Syt , and Co. : Germany ’ s five most exclusive residential areas .
Here is where the costliest residential facility is located - looking over the North Sea .
On average , a square kilometer of my street house costs € 73,300 .
" Syt limits the supply of objects by nature , " the study says , " so the price is high .
A new study shows how much square killer will cost most .
Of course , € 18.70 per square meter is not really little for a student ’ s letter in Munich .
Unlike Germany ’ s top housing , however , one price occurs like Peanuts .
The real-estate service , Engel , has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing base , with cruise prices on scare meters .
There are several tens of thousands of euros ( $ 13,000 ) per square meter , well reported .
But good who can afford ...
Ignorance : Munich , for once , is not at the top .
Champions ’ League : Bayern-Dream Thanks to Mutilers and Girls
Two torturers in Piräus : Bayern-Star Thomas Muller simply has a run .
A happy trucker of Thomas Müller paved the FC Bavaria way to a third : 0 at the Olympic Pireus - then went . '
A sovereign spectacle of the champions ’ League-season season .
World Mayor Thomas Müller and Mario Gimitation have provided the FC Bavarians with a scratch into the " mission of Milan " in the witch panel of Pireus .
The training team of trainer Pep Guardiola won her prelude at the Champions League at Greece ’ s record-high Olympics in the hot atmosphere , thanks to garbage pack ( 52 / 90 + 2 ) and idle Treffer ( 89 ) , earning 3 : 0 ( 0 ) .
Serie ’ s twelfth triumph is to be the first step toward Finals on May 28 , 2016 , where Guardiola , at last , wants to get the finishing pot to Munich in the third round .
At his 28th meeting in the Champion League for Bayerni ’ s leadership , Mr. Roberto was helped by the Olympics Torwart , which turned a flank of the world champion .
" We won ' t underestimate them , " had promised Bayerni captain Philipp Lahm before winning the Karaiskaki Stadium before 31,688 flourishing fans – and the Munich spoke .
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea , without shining .
Pireus had won his latest six royals in the Queen class , including against named clubs like Manchester United , Atlético Madrid , or Juventus Turin .
In 2011 , Borussia ’ s village ( 1 : 3 ) stumbled here as well .
But the Bavaria , unseated in seven European shootings with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They courageously went to work in their aggressive efforts , but often to inadvertently .
The attacks were all too often initiated by game chancellor Douglas Costa , who seldom went against the former brown Omar Edellaoui .
Müller had more lucky from the right than his clank from the right half-field in the upper left Torek struck .
At the 67th minute , the World Cup gave the possible 2 : 0 .
The best opportunities in half were Robert Lewandowski .
First , when Olympics storms hit Ideye Brown , Poland ’ s headscarves switched from line ( 26 ) .
Then , via direct withdrawal , the Torwart Roberto parked with the knees ( 35 ) .
Although Bavarians used to play their dominant game , Piräus was able to use needle sticks .
But it was reliable on Torchers Manuel New .
For example , when he managed a shot of ideyes above the Latvian ( 56 ) .
Before recently , Guardiola left a quarter-billion chain with David Alaba in the center , along with Jerome Boateng , who did well .
Mario Gisin , after muscular problems back in the cadres , first sat outside .
The World Cup hero had given the green light only after the final sentence , said Matthia 's speaker , " Sky , " who wants to do something else , that is evil . "
Guardiola chose against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the battered Levowski ( 59 ) .
Girls arrived late for Arturo Vidal ( 76 ) , and made it clear 13 minutes later , by Elfmeter , a train .
Before the game , riots had appeared in the stadium .
After a smaller group of partially muted Bayern-fans in their audience bloc appears to have provoked followers of Pireus ’ s hosts with words and gestures , the security forces intervened and made headlines against the Munich supporters .
At least a Bayern-fan was at least transported out of the stadium .
Tolling is more risky to lose teeth .
Those smoking will hurt not only the lung , but also the teeth - which suggests a potsdam of long-term studies .
The good news is that risk declines rapidly when it is forgotten .
smokers risk losing their teeth early .
This is the long-term study in Potsdam of an international research team , including several members of the German Food Research Institute .
Compared to non-smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely , rising by 2.5 to 3.6 times .
The scientists had watched more than 23,300 participants .
The main causes of default are cellphones and payrolls , the DIfE .
For these parodontis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
The connection between smoking and payment vessels thus depends on more frequent tobacco fertilizations for smokers .
No matter how much smoking increases the risk to colossus .
People who quit smoking , but who could reduce their risk in short order , write the researchers in the " Journal of Dental Research . "
But it may take more than a decade for the threat to return to the level of non-mourning , says Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
To convince people not to become non-smokers , Head Boeing of DIfE said , “ smoking falls short of life . ”
Not to smoke is good for lung and trader , and it also leads to good health after our findings until high age .
In Germany , more than 20 % of the population aged 65 to 74 is unemployed , and the DIfE was divided .
Early research would have suggested that smoking would risk early default .
The new long-term studies reinforce the findings .
Archeologists Strike Crear Rheinufer on Scendants
For the repeated time being , archaeological dogs have been made at the right Rheinufer in Braln .
Near the building site for the new Rheinboulevard , archaeologists at the Roman Museum buried skeletons and remnants of historic construction , said Museums head Marcus Trier at the Tuesday .
Since the construction of Rhine began , historians have been searching for soil monuments .
In all construction efforts in the urban district , the museum is always added as a specialty for archaeological mining males .
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard , archaeologists became fifth .
Textdocuments already revealed that in the fourth century , a fortress and a church existed in the eighteenth century , Trier explained .
Besides printing and churning , a graveyard had been discovered with around 350 graves , arguably church members .

The EU Commission \ u0027s New Court in Fights on TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free-trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system .
Controversial private dispute-resolution mechanisms for disputes between corporations and states are thus intended to be replaced by a more transparent system that is far more traditional courts in its functioning .
" We want to establish a system that citizens trust , " the EU 's governing commissioner Cecilia Malmelt told the idea .
The Swedish prefers to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in free-trade talks with the US .
The German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the world ’ s largest free-trade area , with 800 million people .
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedure are specifically proposed that the EU and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They are to be drawn equally from the EU , the US , and third states .
For the first time , there is a second authority .
It would allow it to object to judgment .
So far , the procedural participants have agreed on referees , a possibility of entitlement against their judgments .
In the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice , impressed males .
In the long run , it is said to be working toward an International Investment Court .
There , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be settled .
The investor-government arbitration proceedings ( ISDS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , are one of the main reasons for strong resistance in Europe to the TTIP .
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that allows companies to compete on compensation at the expense of taxpayers , snub national legislation , or lower consumer and environmental standards .
In first statements , anti-TTIP organizations like Campact identified the EU Commission ’ s proposals as inadequate .
Most critically , it was criticized that it should not apply to the already-negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada ( Ceta ) .
German Economics Secretary Matthias Machig ( SPD ) , however , called the plans a great advance .
The Commission takes into account key issues that German Minister Sigmar Gabriel made in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed plans for Malmar flows .
The European BusinessEurope Business Association warned against curtailing the economy ’ s caregivers through too many new rules .
Small and medium-size companies , it was said , could be disadvantaged .
When talks on the Free Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) can be concluded , on Wednesday , it remained unclear .
The negotiations have been underway since mid-2013 .
So far , however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
Initially , the agreement should already be established at the end of this year .
That deadline is no longer tenable .
Sufjan Stevens ’ Folk in Hamburg
11 years ago , Sufjan Stevens is on the stage in the quiver Prime Minister Club ( now : Luxor ) .
Aside from him , the infamous followers of the US government , Michigan , have recorded with film styles .
The entire audience , about 40 , is almost captured by Stevens ’ s lecture .
He tells a variety of places that he consistently records , what his minucide and arranged Song report .
Where they were born , and what looks like , in their homeland .
Stevens has since proved to be wonderfully creative error .
With the 2003 Album " Greetings of Michigan : The Great Lake State , " Lieder , who is harmoniously close to American torture in the late 1960 's , seems tolerable at any time .
" Michigan " is rumored to be the first part of a forbidden series : each of the 50 US states should be subsequently occupied .
But " Seven Swans " already appeared in 2004 and in Rhine soon , breaking up positive expectations .
Stevens is cutting back here .
Live suffice him with Gitarre and Banjo .
A year later , New York ’ s musician is returning to the show .
With " Illinois " ( " Sufjan Stevens Invites You To : Come on Feel The Illinoise " ) , a well-covered masterpiece appears in 2005 .
Excessive ideas and stigmatistic Finesse .
The nightmare is rising into America ’ s imalboard charts , and it is absent from an annual bestlist of influential music media .
After extremely productive experiments , Stevens is now using “ The Age of Adz ” ( 2010 ) very large electronic venues .
This sixth decent student is still widely orchestrated , but carried by programmed sequences or sequences , and plays with all kinds of effect .
Long out of the smaller clubs , these refrigerators turn into a colorful spectacle of neo-retrofitting countries and large floating bloody risk .
Sufjan Stevens is now dead as part of a five-member bond by Germany .
More in the dark Hamburger !
Theater , he mainly presents the " carrie and Lowell " available since March .
Although almost 2,000 guests are now in their chairs , the much-hyped stevens are returning to intimacy and torture .
Without giving up a word to the audience , the group of excessive musicians plays through the widely enriched nightmare .
audiences say that the lecture is " more opulatory , " and thus can cast the " ground away . "
First , Stevens needs to be humble , play an amazingly few older Song ’ s , and eventually comes to terms with dead applause .
Jeremy Corbyns ’ s Trap at the Prime Minister ’ s Fragile Hour
Since his election , Mr Corbyns ’ s bust at the Prime Minister ’ s questionnaires has been expected with tension .
The new Labour president , Jeremy Corbyn , is to give his debacle to the prime minister ’ s questionnaires and take on with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Corbyn will rise up to shortly ask Mitday for the first of his six specific questions , with the media likely to scrutinize his performance and nearby Labour MPs .
He called for " less theater and more facts " at this weekly event .
He has also said that he can jump a few meetings to leave them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns , who comes to be a member of the shadow government after his appointment and , after his speech , at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , Labour ’ s decision to quietly criticize a number of Tory-MPs during the fall of the national anthem at a commemoration of a commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has taken place in the newspapers .
Mr Corbyns ’ s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention .
As one spokesman Mr Corbyn said , he " stood in respectable silence , " and he recognized the Royal Air Force 's " heroism in the Battle of England . "
But one member of Mr Corbyns 's shadow government , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two NewBosnia 's program that he advised Labour to sing the national anthem " regardless " of its belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve as Mr Corbyns ’ s top leader , appealing to differences in economics , defense , and foreign policy , while less than one-sixth of the Mr Corbyns party initially supported him as a leader .
The BBC Robin Brant political correspondent says that policy differences are " falling " within Labour , following Mr Corbyns 's remarks about the position of the European Union and limits on profits .
Mr Corbyn , the TUC conference , said that Labour is preparing changes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
Hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labor and pension minister , said that the party is " very clear " that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from $ 26,000 to £ 23,000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to be David Cameron , who , since winning Tory ’ s presidency , has been in parliament for the past decade over the Dispatch Box .
Labour ’ s leader , who has promised another policy prescription , says that he has “ crowd-sourced ” ideas for questions to dominate Cameron , and has given him more than 30,000 inspirations .
The Ilington North MP has said that the prime minister ’ s questionnaires are too confrontational , and that he will be subject to both " clout " and conflict with discord , and focus instead on serious problems like poverty , inequality , and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle , the shadows of economic ministers , will be represented if he does not participate - for example , when Mr. Cameron is heading abroad .
He has also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Bercow , Speaker of the House of Commons , to discuss the problem .
When he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics of a " casperle theater , " often linked to the Prime Minister 's questionnaire , but acknowledged that he failed several years later .
Having been broadcast first on television in 1990 , the questionnaire session with the prime minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader ’ s decision and his leadership in the House of Representatives and his position among his lower house of parliament , even though critics have argued that she had become a caricature and require far-reaching reforms .

£ 1 is rising through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose unexpectedly by data showing an increase in the United Kingdom ’ s wage growth , while the SABMiller supply target boosted the FTSE 100 .
From May to July , the outcome without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % year on year .
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 , and has been estimated at the time of interest-rate hikes .
The pound rose to $ 1.505 % against the dollar and climbed to $ 1.3730 % against the euro by 0.84 % .
The FTSE 100 index showed a 1.49 % increase , to 6,29.21 .
SABMiller was the outstanding asset in the market , making a 20 % leap after rival AB Inv ’ s overpriced offer .
A transaction would combine the world ’ s two largest brighters , bringing together brands like Budweiser , Statement Artois , Peroni , and Grolsch .
Burberley stocks , after encouraging news from the luxury goods competitor Richemont , were 0.9 % higher .
Judging by the latest sales , everyone beats expectations , and so showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are again experiencing growth .
Glencore stocks rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through a stock sell-off as part of his debt-reduction strategy .
The shares of the packaging company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Goldman Sachs had " sold " its rating .
JD Sports rose 3.1 % after the Sports Sports Sports tax on a pre-tax rate of 46.6 million for half a year .
JD Sports head says that higher wages jeopardize expansion .
JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UKK workers could " mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . "
But it is unlikely that purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at its firm , he says .
The cost could be the JD sports expansion plan , he added , and that could mean fewer additional jobs .
Judgment Bieber in the capital , Expedition in Berlin
Judgment Bieber , Megastar .
Late 21 years young , a trader with skin-deep frenzy .
The type of burning hair is hard for € 100 million .
More .
Today , Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin .
And the U17 generation is running through .
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska .
The age of 15 has never heard the name " Ritz Carlton . "
Not bad .
Hundreds of supporters accompany yesterday ’ s justice .
Under Ewa and Viktoria of Poland .
But , since 7 p.m. , police have been sitting in front of Berlin ’ s cold stones , Luxushotel , on the Potsdam .
The Bieber construction : here is where Idol , whose poster is in Stettin , has lived since Monday ’ s day night .
The Suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs as much as her Mama Ewa earns in half a year .
If anything , then .
This says , " In fact , my wictoria would have to sit in the top ten class in the gymnasium . "
" I achieve her dream . "
Schools ?
Who juggles ?
The fans are not .
Nor does Bieber himself .
This has already ensued .
For the superbowl ’ s advertising lady , he received three million , a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company many , many dollars on the Bieber-account .
And , for every puzzle that looks like him and the villains , fever is also collecting .
When justice drinks bars a coffee , you are amazed at the window .
More than 100 million are said to have succumbed .
Some say that the hype is too far .
Others emphasize that bever is , after all , in the US and the United Kingdom , with its new single , " What do you mean ? "
Bieber himself , whose fourth nightmare to follow in November , does not care for the many zero for the first time .
Or so it does .
The Pegida Player puts Lebanese on potatoes
Cartows or Douchers ?
It is both ways - and in the potato monks that the Oldenburger Hani Alhay has developed .
Inspired by the phrase " potatoes instead of benevolents " on a player of the Pegida movement , Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a raft .
In a Pigda demonstration entitled him to the idea of " potatoes instead of monks " that he accidentally watched on television .
Since then , a flesh level of flesh and potatoes has been on display in his Laden .
" This is multiculti for the stomach , " says Alhay .
Lebanese have now joined the patent office in Munich .
They have recently been protected as consumption patterns , according to the Agency .
So how much meat , and how much potatoes there , does not want to betray Alhay .
Only so much : " Better together , " he finds .
Its customers , too , do well with culinary international accommodation .
Metcash launches a land-use campaign to combat Aldi ’ s Incidents
Metcash seeks to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia .
Metcash traders have launched a land-supply campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
As Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build IGA through mainstream marketing and social-media marketing , as well as Events like adelaide-show .
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands like Eishermen Simmo of Dunborough , who redistribute into IGA shops , and shopkeepers selling sanctioned tickets to loyal customers for the South Australia football league .
Metcash is expected to publish other details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the big trader for food , alcohol , and equipment conducts his annual investor strategy .
The stakes are high , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 % of Metcashs IGA shops and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA networks in the eastern states .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial , and IGA retailers have far more market share than in New Wales , Victoria , and Queensland – more than 30 % in South Australia , and 24 % in Western Australia , compared to roughly 14 % in the East Australia .
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that , 12 months after opening its first markets , Aldi will cut away roughly 5 % of the food market in these two states , taking sell-off sales from all existing players , but mostly self-employed , retailers .
According to a report released this week , the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
That forecast assumes that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
The loss of food and food , and the quantity of metcashes of high fix , could cost metcash roughly $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time , metcash market share in the eastern states , mainly Aldi and Coles , though a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that metcashi ’ s sales to food and food will fall by 3.8 % in 2016 , be 4.1 % in 2017 , and 2.1 % in 2018 , reducing the market share from 14 % in 2015 to 10.3 % by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager , Hamish Douglass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , told in Melbourne , that metcash was likely to disappear within a decade . Metcash .
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass ’ s comments .
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash took contact with Mr Douglass last week .
IGA ’ s market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 % since 2010 , and metcashi food and food retailers , which account for about 1,200 IGA retailers , have fallen 43 % since 2012 , reflecting operational deleveraging pressure on sales and margins .
But the trader is reluctant and investing more than $ 150 million to converge with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week , and to improve IGA retailers in improving their damages through faster-growing fresh food , and to provide better selection of privately owned labels .
Metcashs ’ s chief managing director , Ian Morrice , says that the price adjustments and laden cleanup programs will be put on hold , hoping that the big trader will return to earnings growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Thanasi Kokkinakis , who is President of the Australian tennis association , has been supported by Steve Healy .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the " collateral damage " in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios , and , according to the President of the Australian tension federation Steve Healy , deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger man of the talented dug called " Special Ks , " was highlighted by Kyrgio 's infamous clash with Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters .
In a hugely qualifying game in Cincinnati , Kokkinaki and his opponent , Ryan Harrison , had to be separated twice by the referees , with Harrison calling , “ Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios , and I should have beat the child . ”
Finally , while he was seen to crush a tennis girl after a castle thwarting a potential US open-air victory by Richard Gasquet , Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgov , competing with Sam Groth for second place in the one layer behind Bernard Tomic in the David Cup-Halfinals against Britain .
" One thing I have embraced is that , in my view , Thanasi got a bit into the dispute , " Healy said .
He has broken up one player by losing his teeth in US casualties , but he is not the first player to break a thug of frustration with himself , and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has behaved extremely well in US casualties , even under the rather provocative circumstances of harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much credit .
He has a great team around him , has a great family around him , and I believe he has been treated a bit too hard .
He is a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and fits with the team and so on ; never has a problem with the other players ; he is respected in the dress field ; he is trained in hard shape ; he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy ; and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own merit .
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgio in the important preference that begins on Friday , and he describes the " joint decision " as the right thing for everyone , but he assured the man of Canberra as a long-term fixed component of the team . "
" First , we want the team to focus entirely on competition , not on all the controversy [ Kyrgios ] , " Healy said .
And I believe that Nick has risen very fast , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out . He has made some bad mistakes in public view , and deserves all the criticism he receives , but we are trying to support him , try to understand the consequences of his actions . Some time outside the spotlight , when he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate , and it is best for him to be .
Europe ’ s Refugee Crisis : Hungary Declates , Crosses the Limits , Refugee Refugees
Hungary explains the state of emergency and secured the southern border with Serbia on the Tuesday , and kept everyone attempting to enter the country illegally , with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were gathered in a Niemandland and Serbian officials responded with outrage .
The people fleeing violence were fixed and built tents for an unknown period in the streets between the two countries ’ checkpoints and settled .
But frustrations rose .
When a police helicopter hosted them , the migrants " chanted the border ! " and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some withdrew from protest food and water .
Serbia 's foreign minister said that it was " unacceptable " that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
It must talk to Brussels and other countries in the coming days , " said Ivica Dacic in Prague .
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc could not reconcile a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels .
But ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in over-shrunken Italy and Greece . They expressed hope that , at the end of the year , a deal would finally be reached that EU states , including some of Hungary , would accept another 120,000 refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on the Tuesday for a special summit of the European Union to address the continent ’ s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not rely on any immediate action from Brussels or from its neighbors .
The emergency called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave agencies more powers to manage the crisis , allowing them to cut roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto , meanwhile , said that his country is also planning to build a chess wire along its border with Romania to stop the country ’ s influx of migrants – after ending a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News-Correspondent Charlie D ’ Agata reported that even prison inmates were used to create the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
In recent months , Hungary has become a major shortage of refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the European Union .
But Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the coming economic migrants are seeking a better life , not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that contrasts sharply with other EU states , including Germany .
The new laws enacting at midnight in Hungary make it a crime to cross the border , or to inflict , the four-meter ( 13 foot ) high fences that the government enacted along the southern border with Serbia , perpetuating higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers .
" Because of the situation unleashed by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , " government spokesman Zoltan Kovaci told reporters in the southern city of Szeged .
We say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament must agree procedural techniques to the use of the military , which is expected to be next week , but reporters from Associated Press have already seen hard-armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs .
Gyorgy Bakondi , the country ’ s security adviser for Orban , said that when trying to cross the border , 15 others had already entered the country deeper .
They get over by humiliating the fence , now in police custody , and are accused of carrying out crimes according to the new laws .
Authorities are quick to fix the fence .
Sadly , on Tuesday , Malaysian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia , after a train wire was reached to close the border .
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people ’ s data and stifle a crowd to encroach .
Some 20 managed to admit , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would not receive food and water until they could enter Hungary .
-2016 : Hillary Clinton ’ s run-up to Bernie Sanders halves in national polls
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of democratic voters in the primaries ( 58 % before ) , while Sanders ranks second , with 27 % ( 17 % ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet proclaimed whether he is running for the presidency , receives support from 15 % of democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the primary elections began , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is firmly what candidates will support .
But Clinton ’ s supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates in their election .
Since the CBS Newns poll , Clinton has lost some profits in a number of demographic groups .
Clinton holds a large margin among women and moderates , but these precedents have diminished .
Their support for men has fallen sharply , and Sanders is down only 5 points .
Clinton ’ s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and they and Sanders are now equal .
But Clinton still has a big margin among older voters .
Last month , Clinton was a double-digit margin among liberals , but Sanders now has a five-point margin for that group .
Some half of the democratic pre-election voters nationally say that if nominated by the party , they would support Clinton enthusiastically .
A quarter would support it with some caveats , and another 15 % would support it only because it is the candidate .
They would not support six % .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton ’ s current supporters are most enthusiastic about it .
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about one-quarter would support them enthusiastically .
While 48 % of Democratic voters say that they are enthusiastic about Clinton , fewer Republican voters say it about their leading candidates , Donald Trump ( 35 % ) .
When Clinton ’ s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 % ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president ( 13 % ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
Clinton ’ s supporters are also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
It also cites agreement to address problems and how to allocate them .
Because the vice president is putting him in the dark potential for the presidency , 57 % of democratic voters want to see him in the race , even though one-third believe that he should not .
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party , Biden is at the top .
Of Clinton ’ s supporters , more than half say that Biden would be her second election far ahead of Sanders .
If Biden decides not to nominate the Democrats , Hillary Clinton ’ s pre-Sanders lead , from 20 to 30 points in the race without him .
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters view Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 % last month .
Biden is by far a second measure , but the percentage he sees as the most " vocal " has risen .
Yet , when it comes to what matters more in a candidate , democratic voters are asking questions about eligibility .
As in the past month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate is unacceptable to these voters in the primaries .
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results among some important features of voters in their party ’ s primary elections .
majorities view Clinton , Sanders , and Biden as honest and trustworthy , and with strong leadership skills .
Biden performs best in honesty among the three candidates , while Clinton ’ s strength is the leadership .
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say Sanders ( 15 % ) , but 27 % disagree with him .
Democratic voters of the primaries generally also view Clinton , Sanders , and Biden ideologically in conformity with their views .
For all of these measures , about a quarter of democratic voters disagree with Sanders .
Given that questions about Hillary Clinton ’ s use of personal e-mail addresses and a Serb remain a secretary of state during her tenure , most Democratic voters in the primaries are satisfied with her declaration of the matter , and say that she has not affected her overall opinions .
But it is another story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration , while only about one-third are satisfied .
Public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem hit out .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their Clinton general opinions , even though 36 % said it had deteriorated .
They are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 , who say that their Clinton views have become worse .
Although Clinton is regarded by her party ’ s voters as honest and trustworthy , this remains a problem for them : only 32 % view them as honest and trustworthy , 8 % less than last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 % of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and credible person .
At the same time , 55 % of the national electorate sees Trump as unhonest and untrustworthy .
Clinton and Trump , however , receive good leadership notes .
Of the six candidates tested , the best performs are Biden , Carson , and Bush .
Sanders sees a majority as honest , but , as with Carson , many disagree with him .
The electoral error rate for 351 voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump in the nationwide survey .
Ben Carson is located behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS / New York Times poll .
The two candidates now account for half of the support of voters in the new poll , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide , with support for 23 % in the last CBS survey conducted prior to Fox News ’ s debate last month , up 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
But Carson shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
The poll also found that Carson is good for demographic groups , and that Trump exceeds for college Republican voters .
The rest of the field , except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kaanders , is finished with Wiscons Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen the lowest , from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee , and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third , at 6 % .
The failures of 376 Republican voters in this most recent poll are Plus or Minus 6 % , and was conducted in September .
The latest CNN / ORC survey , published last week , shows that Carson is rising in the polls - with 19 % support among Republicans , behind Trump with 32 % support .
The recent ABC News / Washington Post poll showed Trump well ahead of Carson .
Looking at a rising Carson last week , Trump found a silver lining for the former neurosurgeon , even after Carson apologized to question Trump ’ s faith .
" We need energy , " Trump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa .
Ten beef temperatures are now up to 29 degrees warm in the eastern Mediterranean .
Even if top levels are measured only remotely , bathtubers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find warm water .
A bad in the north and the Baltic Sea is likely to be rather brief pleasure at most 17 degrees .
Some no longer go to the sea : maximum 18 degrees of water in this week ’ s North and East Sea , the German weather agency ( DWD ) shares .
Car temperatures , by contrast , continue to offer the Mediterranean : East has even risen to 29 degrees .
In the Adria , the top 25 degrees are at the top , 23 degrees in France .
Egypt ’ s Red Sea comes to 28 degrees .
Five members of the Brotherhood Strengthened with the Death of a Baruch College Neulings
Almost two years after a student died during a bullying rituals in Pocono Mountain , Pennsylvania , a student died against five .
Members of New York ’ s Baruch College Pi-Delta Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun " Michael " during a September 2013 introduction ride , delaying his transportation to the hospital , contributing to his death , the police .
Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-page sand , and was repeatedly attacked , while trying to reach a frozen field .
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches , and then fell unconsciously .
The members of the Pi-Delta PsiC Brotherhood did not call the Nofty Towers 911 after Deng became impotent and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him into a hospital , the police said .
But they had the time to change Deng ’ s clothes , goat his symptoms , and Andy Meng , the Brotherhood ’ s national president to convene advice , told police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
" At that point , the members began hiding Uzbelia , fundamentally putting the well-being of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng , " said police chief Wagner .
He could not be revived , and he died the next morning from his injuries .
Deng was repeatedly added violations of heads , rags , and colonels after an autopium report .
“ Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood ’ s harassment , ” said Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer representing Deng ’ s family , at least one student has died every year at the harassment since 1970 .
Brothers and their members must be held accountable , and this move by authorities is very important .
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree indictment for murders for the first five members .
Thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Meng , are also charged with bullying attacks and forming criminal association .
" We want not only to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that sanctioned it - whether officially or not officially - it , we will hold them accountable , " Wagner said at a Tuesday press conference .
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has renounced communal affiliation .
That will happen when the Fed Raises Interest Rates
A rate hike comes , and the house will falter , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know is how long this will take , and how long it will last .
In particular , history offers little guidance for the economy .
A recession came within 11 months of the first rate hike , and lasted 86 months .
The Fed ’ s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond .
So US Federal Reserve officials have been so fiercely emphasizing that investors should focus not on when it starts to raise interest rates , but on the period needed for normalization .
Indeed , several variables matter .
In the end , however , market participants may find that all the excitement over hiking rates may have been exaggerated .
" The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will invariably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of " cheap money , " said Julian Jessop , chief economist of Capital Economics , in a community of customers .
By contrast , we are not expecting a gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
But this does not mean that there will be no impact .
Here is a historical trajectory based on how some areas of the economy might respond :
As the market saw last month , anticipating rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
Once the increase occurs , influence will not be so dramatic .
" There seems to be a tendency that asset yields will be eroded 12-24 months after the first rate hike , which may reflect monetary lags again , " German bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
More specifically , the market has been upward – about 14 % – in the past 35 years , on the path to rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days after ( an average return of 2.6 % ) , then back to the norm , after 500 days , with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 % , according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll , the chief asset strategist at Nuveen Asset ’ s .
The Deutsche Bank said that the effect on stocks tends to occur later in the auction cycle , with returns beginning to narrow .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often encourage rate hikes .
In this case , the Fed faces some conditions that were not seen before and that could accelerate a recession .
Remarkably , GDP will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates .
According to Germany ’ s Bank , the 118 rate hikes since 1950 have been only twice as nominal GDP below 4.5 % .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect it to continue , expecting only 1.5 % , according to the Atlantic Fed , for the third quarter .
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic environment may be risky , raising the question , " Whether this time it is different , " said the Deutsche Bank .
Market participants have studied this year ’ s Fed rate hike , and all eyes have been on this week ’ s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , which ends on Donbas Day .
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in that meeting , futures trade is only a 25 % chance .
" All the booms in our study , from 1950 to now , took place in a super-cycle of increasing GDP , dwarfing pre-recession levels very quickly after the recovery began , " the report says .
By contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record has been 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
Mainstream income has also been volatile , as the market preempts a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on equities when the strategic exchange rate changes .
For bonds , yields seem to be changing the direction once the first rate hike occurs in the cycle .
In the end of the rate cycle , bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to converge , causing the exchange rate to flat .
High-yielding bonds often yield better in such a climate , even though " we are still wary of expecting higher returns , " Kathy Jones , Fixed-Income Analystics for Schwab , said in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones argues , markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations .
" Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , " she wrote .
Short-term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit has widened , and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy .
Large and entire , corporations that manage the larger share of US business will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Multinational companies with large debts will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market , as well as financing their debt .
" History shows that " quality " stocks tend to be very positive in three months after an initial rate hike , " Goldman Sakharov ’ s analysts said in a report to customers .
Firms with a strong balance sheet have outperformed companies with weak balance sheets , on average , by five percentage points after each of the rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also outstripped their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Debt becomes a big problem .
Goldman said that companies with a large share of flexible interest rates will lose the most .
Outside the pure equity games , the rising dollar will also benefit consumers .
savers may see gains from higher returns , even if experts differ on how fast that will happen .
BBC Radio 3 Classic FM , says MPs Andrew Bingham .
Parliament 's Conservative MP criticized the station for its " duty . "
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals .
He targeted the BBC Music Awards and said that they were only imitating The Brits .
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said it was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 is " transforming " into Classic FM , claiming that a leading MP and increasing pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that private senators are not doing .
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the publicly-owned radio station was " stupid " and , increasingly , indistinguishable from its commercial competitors .
" Radio 3 does not seem to like the word " stupid , " he said .
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
The BBC Music Awards , who began last year , appears to be just another name .
So , when you try to do otherwise , these are two spontaneous examples of what you are already in the market , ” Mr Bingham said .
BBC Director-General rejected the accusations , arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
What I learned from Radio 3 will not learn about classical music somewhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed .
“ And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is truly important , ” he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that working harder to engage the audience than in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
Radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearings of the Committee on Culture , Media , and Sport to win commercial rivals .
Damien Collins , a Tory MP , attacked The Voice , the BBC ’ s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
Consider why this program is often discussed , because it is not originally , and not very markedly ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC was produced 11-show – with paloma Faith and Boy George as judges – in a " special BCC " way .
He added that he wishes the company to " find a dose out of our own houses " when the next time it arrived at a show of entertainment .
But he refused to rule out other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose the slowest in August , and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
In the first three months of 2015 , there was a 7 % increase in online sales .
Last month , there has been the lowest since records began in 2000 .
Online sales were magnified three years ago by using mobile phones to buy .
Experts believe that the Black Friday curtailed spending in November .
For more than a decade , virtual shopping has boomed , and many of Britain ’ s main shopping roads have morphed into ghost cities .
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating , as new figures showed only 7 % in the first three months of 2015 .
Total spending in August represented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with a mere 5 % increase year on year .
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating , as new figures indicate only 7 % growth in the first three months of 2015 .
" If you look at growth rates for the preceding years and decline by 2000 , it has always developed , " Andy Mulcahy , the IMF selling dexes editor , told the Guardian .
He said that online sales rose three years ago , when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
It meant that more people could buy online , and that people could do so in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
But that is now festering , and we may see growth shrink .
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a cause of declining sales .
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases prior to this event , each held last Friday in November .
Last year , the average number of buyers scrapped around their computers to make their noses , and some traders ’ Web sites plummeted .
Experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for snouts , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £ 5 was spent a little more than € 1 per day .
For some products , such as television and washing machines , more than one-third of shopping is now conducted through Web shops .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online , rather than in domestic city chains .
Muslims buried in Mecca for the Croat accident - Bin Laden 's family is sanctioned .
Muslims ’ bodies of 29 are taken through the streets by Muslims in the first graves of Mecca .
Saudi Arabia Burdens Part of the Huge Saud Bin Laden Group
The Health Ministry also said that , after the crash crashed , 394 people were injured .
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the casualties were taken through the streets to bury those killed when Mecca ’ s grandmosque crashed .
Suspicions filled , largely white , with the scares to show up their respect when the first of the dead arrived for their last trip to the Al Moaissa-Friedhof .
The sadness process passed on to the Holy Stations , where only days before a tree crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the beds .
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed sanctions on the Bin Laden family ’ s construction for the catastrophe that left 394 injured .
The bodies of 29 bears killed when a riot crashed through the Great Mosque of Central Mecca were taken through the streets .
Among the dead , Qasim Akram was from Bolton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the Kran overthrew .
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents prior to the start of the annual Hajj .
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the adjacent to Mecca will continue with thousands of people who will still enter the city .
Today , King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have let the Krank ’ s arm stand when it was not used .
An Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
The agency ’ s English-speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the company ’ s leadership was forbidden abroad .
Earlier this week , Salman vowed to reveal what caused the overthrow of the sick , which plunged into an interior of the Grand Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hadjj that later takes place this month .
The Bin Laden group has not issued statements about de Krans ’ collapse , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
The Royal Dekret also chipped the group for non-current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists .
Dozens of cages surround Mecca ’ s grandmosque as part of the massive construction run by the Bin Laden group .
The Bin Laden family has been linked to Saudi Arabia ’ s ruling family for decades , and has taken over larger construction projects .
The late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a renegade son expropriated by the family in the 1990 ’ s .
The collapse of the sick came in the midst of strong winds and rains , just days before millions of pilgrims arrived in the Kingdom , which at least one healthy Muslim is needed .
Officials said that 158 people stayed in the hospital .
Officials ordered that 1 million rials ( £ 174,000 ) should be paid to the ranks of the people who are treated , and that the same amount should be permanently injured .
Other injured people receive half that amount .
B & Q & nbsp ; Boss says that the cheap East European craftsmen are over .
British Employ Increasingly , Veronique Laury
Eastern Europe ’ s qualified craftsmen have been rising .
As a result , 200 other screws targeted at craftsmen are opened .
At the same time , Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q sellers nationwide .
Of Rupert Stein , City Chief Correspondents of Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons are putting down their dams and peninsula in favor of using qualified East European artisans to conduct work at home .
If you can skillfully deal with a hammer or a peninsula to encounter the wings , now you seem to be a minority .
For Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out their homes , the company ’ s chief executive , behind B & Q .
Véronique Laury , a new Kingfisher managing director who owns the traditional chain of construction , said that a big increase in the number of skilled traders from Eastern Europe who are now offering low-price services has become obsolete .
As a result , Kingfisher plans to open 200 other screenwriters to B & Q dealers and to close 60 sales sites .
Maur ’ s Laury said she wants more women to work in B & Qaida ’ s , because women make eight of the ten purchasing decisions in the store .
For the moment , men outweigh the men among employees .
She said that it is necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that are more women single-households undertaking than in the past .
Maur 's Laury said , " It still works for a majority of men in our branches .
We need to shift this closer to balance .
In principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 % of their choices about the purchase of articles by women .
Women play a big role in the decision-making process .
Mrs Laury , a senior company listed by only five women on top of a British SE100 index , has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied 50 % of the team with women , including its management and head of finance .
Mr. Laury said , " This was a conscious choice - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women on our board .
Kingfisher reported a decline in half a year ’ s gain and sales , as the group owed the costs to shutting down the strings .
Kingfisher , owning Screwfix and B & Q , will open 200 new branches .
AI / Whether for disloyalty in court
On the national court of Klagenfurt , on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian Volleyball vice , AI / Dob , must have taken responsibility for disloyal and repudiation .
The defendants were not guilty .
One was also accused of abuse .
The accusation made him legally free in May .
The current process has been abandoned .
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel , the investigation had crystallized that , from 2006 to 2011 , the defendants used funds from United Statesmen to dispose in their functions for private purposes .
The damage is estimated at around € 400,000 .
The sports officials are also charged with financial offenses .
This was the fact that Justice Michaela Sanin left the Chief Executive .
It should be negotiated later .
In the defense ’ s rejection of disloyalty , the defense asserted that none had any wealth downside at any time .
The sports officials would have invoked only expenses and outsourced the sports club , which they spent from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money – the passiva was around 600,000 signs in 2001 ( $ 44,000 ) .
" Back then , we were faced with the situation : let ’ s keep or close the club , " one of the accused , in the brottle , told big business of the financial office .
With his colleague and co-accused , he decided to do the job .
With all the risks .
" We required money that laid our life insurance as collateral with the bank , " he said in consensual terms .
The agreement was reached : they can manage the money freely , but no debt must be made .
More broadly , if financial , the payoffs were paid back in retrospect until 1991 .
As a result , some of the disclosures were paid only years later , beginning in 2003 , when a convergence plus was on the account .
So Paul , not detailed , also appeared to explain what happened .
The accounts and books jointly managed the two defendants , said the second defendants .
Why the payoffs had not been disclosed in detail was the judge asked .
It wasn ’ t in the details of the financial outcome that debt freedom was important , the answer .
In 2011 , when an official began investigating for abuse , an amount was transferred from € 120,000 to the unification account .
Those were savings , the defendants declared .
The securities account went to the name of the second accused , and , according to his words , was not known to Verein .
" Why ? " The judge wanted to know .
The interviewer was long unaware of the answer .
He then said , after all , that he believed that this was the best thing to agree .
If something happened to him , no one would have known of that money , the prosecutor would be in the room .
The accused was informed , the official justified .
This transfer was formulated as a " compensation package . "
Why Schadenfreude ?
As a result , the first accused accused said he disagreed with the phrase because he was never hurt .
But what I want to do when the lawyer says , " You are all off the hook . "
" I a lawyer ? " he asked .
The official said that he never had a penny salary , he calculated only miles and diets .
He added $ 1,000 per month to diets , but was much larger , added to the actual outlays .
Appropriate documents for the early years were unproved by the defendants .
They said that they had not been rescued after operating inquiry that was judged right .
The other defendants had drawn kilometers ’ money as well .
All the obstacles had been made in cash , he said , from his location of international markets to the bank in Bleiburg .
The main treatment will continue on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
Another 30,000 Jobs Packard
In addition to the three-year personnel decrease that has been underway , the computer will reduce further jobs when the company is divided .
The US computer giant Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) has no end .
The US technology industry , as part of its restructuring , plans to reduce its corporate saving rate by 25,000 to 30,000 .
This is intended to save a $ 2.7 billion ( $ 2.4 billion ) cost , which the company distributed at the Tuesday .
The move would lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
Reducing 55,000 jobs for three years is not complete .
At the end of the 2013 / 14 business year , HP employed roughly 302,000 employees .
In retrospect , the Hewlett-Packart stock dropped 2.3 % .
California 's palo Alto , a big-ticket company , is splitting out : to combine computer and printing business this year into a new society - separated from higher-profile areas with computer servers and databases for firms and other services .
Both parts of business are quoted on the stock market .
A new disappointing PC sales , together with weaker demand for corporate customers for their services , recently joined the world ’ s second-largest personal master to Lenovo .
In the third business headquarters at the end of July , sales of PC and pressure declined by 11.5 % .
The sales fell by 8 % , to just $ 25.4 billion .
As a result , the proceeds declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds to secession and massive statements about change in the industry .
The 76-year-old company , led by Meg Whitman , has lately responded that customers are buying smartphones and tablets rather than conventional computers and doing more business online .
Overall , Whitman ’ s restructuring plan envisages reducing about 5,000 jobs .
Conflict : Majority Against the Anti-ISIS Education Mission
But direct participation by German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would overwhelmingly object : 54 % opposed it , 35 % showed agreement .
Other states find themselves positively attacking the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .
By contrast , 24 % are involved in the conflict .
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad opposes 51 % of respondents that they are 20 % .
29 % could not vote .
Auto : Ten Press Day on the 66th IAA
At the center of the excesses are connected , self-driving cars , and electric mobility by September 27 .
After two press releases , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile exhibition , under the motto , “ mobility , ” on Thursday .
The broad audience can visit the IAA from Samstag .
The automobile association providers look forward to about 9,000 visitors two years ago .
Matastrophic : Storm of Serb Hungarian Frontiers
The Hungarian police have used raw tea and water treatment against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border .
Euronews-correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the collapse of violence at the border-control point .
He reported a telephone story :
One group of refugees broke the line .
A police line had emerged , and a water plant was ready to operate behind the police .
Forty to 50 refugees began to go to civil servants with stones , sticks , and plastic flags .
Officials initially used poefferspray uninterrupted .
Afterwards , police used tear gas .
Much tear gas has been simmering in the direction of refugees .
This dissolved the group .
Now the refugees have withdrawn somewhat in warning .
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was thrown away from the zone .
Children who breathed tear gas shouted .
Other refugees languish together , suffering from breathlessness .
Serbian police press secretaries also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pop language .
Deciding the Fed ’ s Interest Rates
The world watches when the Fed gathers on two days , on Wednesday and Donbas , to make the important decision whether or not to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who thought last week that the Fed would do so now thinks that the Fed will remain far longer and keep interest rates at 0 % today .
It is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL .
" For the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero level and begin a process of normalization of interest rates , " said Angel Ubide , the head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is relatively good , trillions of dollars added to its balance sheet , and only low inflation .
But the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions .
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase , but the evidence suggests that the odds against it are good .
The decision should be announced at 20,00 GM on Donbas Day .
Delta State University Capital Protection
Following the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday -- and before shooting and killing his colleagues later on the day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was " suffering " from the first murder , and that he wanted to " to fail , " authorities on the Tuesday .
The police in Gautier , Missississippi , said that Lamb , Docent for Geography , and Social Scientific Education at Delta State University , which called Notrupnumbers against 10 : 00 on Monday .
He said that he shot someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the chief emergency staff that police must send police officers to their homes .
He said , “ I shot my wife yesterday , ” and he also mentioned that a " black dog " is in the house but that " no one will disturb , " but it is likely to be upset .
The police asked him for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb offered no explanation for his appearances .
As police arrived at the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note of Lamb , 45 , who said : " I 'm so sorry , I wanted to take it back .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman ever loved to me . "
After writing the notice , Lamb killed 300 miles at Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before eventually taking his own life on the evening , when police encircled him .
University President William Lage said that he didn ' t know of a Lamb conflict , but " of course there was something in Mr Lamb 's idea . "
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt , officials said on the Tuesday that there was " no information , " no evidence , " for a " three . "
Shawn O ' Steen , who said that they were married around seven years , was described as " good man . "
The two were abandoned 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O ' Steen said that he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 , and that they were " destroyed on the ground . "
He said that her daughters were " the best friends . "
Prentiss worked online from home , according to Linsday Knowles , identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss .
Knowles said that for the past three years , Prentiss , which had one dog named Lightning , has met with lamb .
" She always wanted to help other people , " Knowles said .
The police said that Lamb had invoked relatives at some point on Monday to say , " he is not in jail . "
When police arrived at him on the high road 1 near Greville later that night , Lamb launched his car , fled to foot , went to the forest , killing himself at a shot .
Lamb received a Ph. D. from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his lifeline indicates on the university ’ s Web site .
Stars who Lost their Happiness
The actor ( left ) , as image of his son , Redmond ( right ) , had several stressful years .
He fought against leukemia in 2001 , and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner , Farrah Fawcett , for cancer .
The actor is also reportedly drug-induced , and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession .
All of this is certainly taking its toll .
Eurowings : Lufthansa Builes the Corporate
The Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
A half-billion euros a year , the Lufthansaari company alone wants to save with a better organization .
Corporate transformation will cost the workplace 150 of the world ’ s roughly 1,000 leaders .
Meanwhile , the Pilot Union is negotiating .
The Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and adding value to Eurowings , the low-cost .
The realignment target was an outcome contribution of about $ 500 million per year from cost and solving synergies , the airline divided on Wednesday .
Among other things , the Lufanstha will no longer head the passenger business .
Eurowings ’ cheap flip should be developed as individually as possible .
At the CEO ’ s board of Carsten Spoze , Karl Ulrich Garnings will be responsible for town euro ratings .
With the reconsideration , it underscores the importance of euro wings , with which it will compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .

Airlines , under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which accounts for three-quarters of the € 30 billion annual rate .
New Pilots Negotiations
In the conflict with the pilot Cockpit ( VC ) pilot group , the negotiations are supposed to be restarted after the court stopped strikes on this Thursday .
That divided the union .
The talks are meant to be retirement rules for pilots .
Cockpit wants " in a year of predicted records " to produce results that are sustainable as soon as possible .
The trade-union conflict with Airline has led to divergence in recent months .
In addition to pilots ' transitional coverage , the “ saving prescription ” concept is in place .
The Lufansa , in the fight against competitors , is preempting on its own low-cost Eurowings .

Manchester United ’ s Luke Shaw can not play for two questions monthly .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fragment of his right Bone in the Champions-League defeat of Manchester in the PSV .
While this has brought leftist foreign defenders to rest and excluded him for at least six months , Louis van Gaal is not hoping that Shaw can play that season again .
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV .
He was treated nine minutes on the field , and required oxygen before getting to the hospital .
Van Gaal said , " He has a double correction and is hospital . "
He will be moved tomorrow , or perhaps a day later , in Manchester .
It is horrible - a boy who comes to manchester United with 18 , has a very hard time playing and then playing fantastically , and then happens .
In the clothing abnorm , he had an oxygen mask .
He joked .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , it takes the six months , and he will not play in the troop phase .
I hope he can play that season again .
Moreno seemed fortunate to have escaped a Red Card and the imposition of a pariah .
Nicola Rizzoli , the arbiter , did not punish Mexicans .
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian referee was wrong .
You can judge yourself if I say that a parent and a red card were due .
It was a very bad attack with both legs .
One tweet in Shaw 's account was , " I thought you would be all for your news . Words can not describe how broken I 'm , I 'm , now , " I get more back . "
This was related : Manchester United States suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeating the PSV .
The English defender has an additional incentive with France ’ s European championship to recover by June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV trainer , said , " It is a very bad injury . "
When a player with this kind of injury leaves his place , all are very sad .
Our players never want to violate an opponent .
Moreno suffered a blowdown when Mexico played Van Gaal ’ s Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
" He does very hard , because he was not intent on violating the adversary , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , " said Cocu .
For me , it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched [ Moreno ] him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
In conversation with SBS6 , Moreno said , " I know how hard this can be .
I feel very bad at this ; it is so sorry for me .
Andrés Guardado , the PSV player , was also put in the hospital , following a game play by Chris Smalling .
To be sure , David Cameron knows better The Lorax ?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost usefully .
Unless you are David Cameron .
When asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite son , the prime minister chose The Lorax , the Dr. Seau ’ s environmental fund , delivered in 1971 .
It was a difficult election , Cameron writes in a news on the company 's Web site of superCamps , and continues : " Beginning , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to be an image or a message we have missed . "
All the beautiful and good , except that the subsequent paper that Cameron claims to describe is the book ’ s action reflects a 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
" In the midst of the muddled city of Th-needle , where all nature has gone and even the air is a good thing , a boy named Ted Audrey , hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , " one reads .
As if that were not suspect enough , the text presented by Cameron reads , in part , as the summary of the Lorax film , presented on the Internet Movie Database Web site , and starts : " A boy ’ s boy car car car car car car car carrier dreams , where everything is artificial and even a commodity is a good thing to win . ”
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father , Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the book , where an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is ravaged by the money-hungry , dreamy-staring once-in-the-clogging once-in-yourself , despite protests by the eminent Lorax , a hosting " shining creature in the name of trees . "
Most likely , such a relatively low public-relations task has been delegated to a hero who did not read The Lorax 20 times after one child .
One Down-Street spokesman said that the text probably came from Cameron ’ s constituency office .
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron ’ s staff delivered the text , but offered no other immediate comments .
Clearly , Adam Lyth was threatened by exclusion from the English team , but it is still difficult .
To object to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cadres that England has chosen for the goals , I can not see a repeat of the 3-0 test defeat .
I would not rule out an exit victory .
Alastair Cook ’ s side may not be as sophisticated as three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batting Exhibit , and the spirit of community is strong ; they will not bear a scars of 2012 , only a youthful positive attitude .
With the ball , Moeen Ali is developing as spin bowler and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown Test-level size , is an option for the attack .
The message is that Adam Lyth is out of the English testing cadre and is replaced by Alex Hales .
The decision to dismiss Adam Lyth , of course , is difficult for me to analyze as his chief trader in Yorkshire .
Its seven tests have had two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple , but harsh , reality is that cricketers are directed toward results .
There was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and this led to the nomination , because - and I said it was - their own best selection of players .
Lyth would have been extended long ago , but he had control of his own fate .
If , one hopes , he points out more Yorkshire purchases , there will be another chance .
The English trainer Trevor before Bayliss lauded his position , even if he did not do so well , and this is not surprising to me ; it is , above all , a tea man .
How much time a testing player will get to show his signs is difficult .
Lyth received seven opportunities , such as Sam Robson before him , while Nick Compton received nine .
Only Compton received a chance to play home and outward .
The only accusation to rise up was that England first appointed Jonathan Trovern in the Caribbean , when Lyth was at its highest level , but that lost opportunity is now past .
Alex Hales arrives , and he is a catchphone I estimate .
He is a X-factor-cricket player , which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season , when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge what hit us .
He must have at least the same opportunities as before him , but that depends , of course , on the team mission in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of letting Moeen beat alongside Cook , which would produce an Extra spin bowler and receive four quicks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don ’ t see why a catchphrase can ’ t beat there , and this leftist woman has already shown that he is a vicious cycle of cricket players .
Moeen may not have finished his job for his County Worcestershire , but he is a number three for her , and there is no difference .
My former tea colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests in the first drug before he appeared as an orator in 2001 .
He immediately accomplished three hundred races , and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari is in the cadres as a blind man , and , in my limited dealings with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
People may view his statistics - on average , 31 with the thugs and 35 with the ball - and think , it is a punch , but there are no large numbers of backup spinners who rise up their hands and trainers have chosen young people .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Beyond the team , England has made a few smart complements to trauma .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawargen , Batsman from Sri Lanka , as an adviser to the test games could be a master coup .
He is one of the most nice contenders of the game that will bring many experiences , because he has played on all counts and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes for the white Kug phase of the tour , bringing energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I have always felt that he is created for international cricket competition , as a player or a coach , and like Mahela , he has insights that can benefit us .
Sometimes , new voices can be sweetened in the clothes , even if the news is consistent with what was once said .
Colly ’ s team colleague at Durham , Ben Stokes , is not used at One-Dayers , Root received a similar break with Australia , and I have no problem with it .
Some will not agree , but coaches and team makers will not determine the timetable .
And they must bear in mind how players ’ jobs depend on outcomes .
Such decisions are not easily made .
The United Kingdom ’ s “ Brexit ” exit from the EU ” side could gain momentum if the economy turns into a slump by 2017 .
David Cameron ’ s ill-conceived renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will run deeper into trouble every day , even without the election of genial Jeremy , “ Is it yes or no ? ” Corbyn as Labour ’ s leader or the TUC , who fiercely fought over Europe at the Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage .
One European diplomat friend recently said that some member states , as deeply enmeshed in a variety of crises , as the EU is now , and not always out of their own guilt , are comfortable with the UK itself with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes that most often do not want them .
In Brighton , at their annual meeting , the TUC decided that it does not like it if it jeopardized social protection .
We might also call it Dave and Georges Selfish Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers are climbing to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , taking pictures of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , coming home , and saying that they are winning allies for reform .
It ’ s always about me .
My European friend , who wants a Britain to look out inside the EU room -- " Let 's not just with France , " says Berlin -- and shows that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don ' t care whether we remain or go .
Germany ’ s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel has been an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the excessively long harshments of Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) , and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France ’ s François Hollande is looking at his re-election or replacement in 2017 .
He is also a declining force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government ; Spain has a leftist government .
It is hard to imagine them turning out a leg to help the self-employed Britons , whose energy should be better deployed to prevent Scotland 's exit from the UK - something that they don ' t want , either , because most similar separatist tendencies have .
As a result , some such ministers may even deliberately offer unhelpful comments , quite in the SNP-style , whereas Britain ’ s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Brexiti process , my friend suspects .
" The renegotiation was a default , " and " the United Kingdom has not gained any value from renegotiation . "
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense , and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of press barons , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn , but not that supported our entry in 1973 with a 2 / 1 ratio .
They can remind Boris Johnson , the arch-euro opportunists who made a name as an " EU-wide banana " Brussels correspondent in the early 1990 's .
For all his craziness , Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies .
These included the Medley of Tax fear-fear villains , telephone hacking foreigners , and the pseudo non-Indians , who own most of our major newspapers .
In fact , Tony Blair thought similar about them , but found that sitting in a cage with a hot Gorilla would better be distributed bananas to distract him rather than become his lunchtime and evening .
Indeed , Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself , when he resisted Cameron ’ s “ referendum clause , ” because he had put the principle above the EU ’ s unapproved constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , opening a backdoor to it .
The press never denied him .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a friendly clause on Westminster ’ s Monday -- I said that he no longer needed time for me to waste -- seems at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock ’ s Boykott Murdoch ’ s strategy of the 1980 ’ s , a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , whose BBC sofa left on Sunday .
Corbyns 's official position on Europe is - I say , friendly - development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside Ukips are traditional metabolic blood cells and the more wild ties of Tory ’ s petty English English English English English bourgeois can say yes .
It is what Hilary " A Benn , but not a gasoline " on radio and television this week , when the parrot inventor did not admit that Corbyns ’ appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadowy chancellor was a bad idea .
I was reminded of the 1970 ’ s , when his old father tried TV to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hiller ’ s fight was even more attractive .
But fighting to remain " in all circumstances " -- Benn 's words -- was not what McDonnell said even JC told his running mates and MPs , according to all reports , at their final meeting .
Whatever Corbyn 's puzzling bottom-up image , think that he has touched me , news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and , above all , in the social media , a mastectomy of paranoia , and treason .
It is right not to give Cameron a free card to Europe that allows him to believe Labour ’ s support in the referendum campaign to be taken for granted , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyns 's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy , their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of left-wing debate , for which narcissism of small differences is a central tenet of dogmatic arguments .
Like its ambiguity about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not embark on a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find meaning at home in everything for their superiors .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , including suspicious voters , to make concessions to the British when all of this can be pointless ?
The US is already rather disappointed with poor military performance in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a cut in power from the Tory government , which I was reminded of something British Influence Security Forum when I started on Monday .
Public Health England ’ s Experts on E-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , in part connected to the tobacco industry , told researchers .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) joined Lancet by criticizing evidence used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in their report on e-cigarettes .
PHE published the " Final Report " last month , describing it as a " extensive review of the evidence . "
But some researchers have challenged the resilience of the data , pointing out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the " extraordinarily awful base , " on which the PHE founded its most important conclusion .
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ , asking whether the claims are " built on stone or sand . "
Martin McKee , a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said , " A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof efficacy . "
They said that the public expects the PHE to claim that " the best current estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking " based on detailed verification of evidence and modeling .
Indeed , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been recruited to develop a model for multiple policy analysis ( multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ) – MCDA ) to match their views on the damage from various nicotine products to a synthesis ; the meeting ’ s results have been summarized in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a EuroSwiss Health , whose CEO was previously considered an independent study by British Tobacco ( BAT ) .
He also signed the public health credentials of BAT in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was reportedly receiving from Philip Morris International , a tobacco company .
The reasons for choosing the Panel ’ s members are not delivered , but they include several known e-cigarette champions , some of which also invoke industry funding in paper .
Other participants at the meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control .
The PHE ’ s tobacco management also attended the meeting .
Significantly , the group 's research " says McKee and Capewell , " that there is a lack of " strong evidence of the damage to most products . "
However , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report .
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE 's claims that " so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes have been used as a way to smoke children or non-smokers . "
Prof Kevin Fenton , the director of health and well-being at the PHE , said that the BMJ ’ s claims had already been responded before .
“ E-cigarettes are far less damaging than smoking . ”
Every other lifetime smoker dies from his addiction .
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low relative to that , but that we continue to study the long-term effects .
PHE has a clear duty to information the public about what the evidence shows , and what not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers relative to tobacco .
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking disease , and smoking costs $ 2 billion per year .
By clearly demonstrating current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but that only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking will be met with our national responsibility .
BBC Should give Eastden , former Channel 4 Director
As former Channel 4 Chairman Luke Johnson has said , the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice , saying that commercial rivals would " give their right arms " to Hitler 's like Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the round-the-clock fee should be used only to make the kind of programs that are not donated by other users .
He criticized the BBC for placing public-legal programs that are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience in hard-fought windows against their rivals ’ most popular shows and those like BC4 .
After Tony Hall , the BBC ’ s chief executive , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that , for six years , he had tried to get into the BBC without success .
" I have problems with the idea that BBC commits or sends programs that would clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals , " said Johnson to the House of Representatives Communication Committee as part of his study of the BBC 's future .
If you want to keep the roundwork afloat , which I do not think of as a good idea in the medium or long run , you should at least produce on programs that do not do or commission others .
They send The Voice in a first-rate window , because they want to generate as wide support for their future .
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke ; it is ridiculous , of course , nonsense .
As Johnson said , " I don ' t see why a regressive tax could be financed without subsidies .
The Voice is such a program ; EastEnders is another , admittedly both proprietary products .
Frankly , other channels would provide their right arm .
I am pleased to see how this should be public television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC altogether .
Johnson , an entrepreneur who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC owed the hunt for evaluation " because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe it is the best way to secure long-term support . "
His comments on the BBC ’ s most popular shows are returning to what former head of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC Shows sell like Eastders .
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs " to BC4 should go to BC4 , where much of the audience can not be measured , but they can do their job , and they can argue that if they go to their hypocritical missions for justifying £ 4 billion ( $ 0.6 billion ) , " now , of course , we have all these shadowy programs that no one has seen . "
They place them in a time window when no one ever wanted to see them .
As Johnson famously told the Committee , “ I ask you to find a more regressive system in terms of who can get the best value .
Of course , all of us think that it is worth $ 150 a year , but I wonder if I think that this is true , because they don ’ t consume much of the BBC for those $ 150 .
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein , who also testified before the Tuesday Committee , called for the BBC to review its travel mission to " inform , educate , and maintain . "
He said that little of BBC production would now officially be classified as an education - he said that 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % is radio - and she should take an example of the publicly-owned TV channels in Australia and Canada to “ inform , educate , and keep . ”
On the issue of partnerships , Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as that of the Proms , which he said to be shown only a handful on television , and to join alliances with commercial senators to make everything available online .
The Sonogenetics Can Managing Brain Cell Cells
The video shows how nematodes change direction at the moment when they are punished with clangimpsies .
Scientists have created worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be managed by outbreaks .
The tiny nematodes change the direction of the moment when they are punished with clangimpsies too high for human obedience to be heard .
The impetus is working through the collection of Motoneuron cells genetically modified to carry the membranes that respond to ultra-waves .
Researchers Lessly write and write Hirnactivity with light on this issue .
The researchers said that worms showed the power of a new procedure , called Sonogenetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart , and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace low-level brain stimulation , an invasive process that provides electrical impulses to the brain of humans to treat symptoms of the Parkinson ’ disease .
Chalasani usually does not respond to ultrasound , but he found that when surrounded by microscopic air bubbles , they did .
The bubbles , he found , reinforce the ultra-waves that then enter the worms .
Increased ultrasound waves are working on structures called TRP / Ionenel channels and found in the membranes by some of the painkillers .
The waves make the opening of these ion channels , and activate the cells to which they are accorded , Nature Communications .
In order to create ultra-hyped nematodes , Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of her motoneurons carry TRP-4 Ionnel channels .
If he applies ultrasound to the changed creatures , the waves are amplified and transferred to the worms that divide the modified Motoneurons .
The proceedings have some similarities with optogenetics , a seminal tool that allows scientists to switch neurons with impulses of light .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over the technology .
Contrary to light , which must be deferred on an optical fiaser to what is wanted in the brain , low-frequency ultrawalls can happen freely , sending them to the brain from the top of the specter .
" We believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus can make the human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the Ultraal Signal in a clinical attitude to certain neurological treatments , " said Chalasani .
Other applications could focus on muscular cells and insulin-producing cells , along with them .
Illegal torture equipment - just on your doorstep !
Britain ’ s Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Arms Messence video .
Hard murderers !
Side-shattering bells !
Stream !
And electric shocks causing ageing pain , but not leaving a trace !
The cheerful voice and cartoon-images leave no doubt that this advertisement is a formidable parody , produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government ’ s willingness to send weapons to oppressive regimes over the defence and Security Equiboree International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London ’ s Dockland .
Relative : DSEI Weapons Face : Authoritarian regimes Pump to London
But a separate campaign also leads to too many placards , seen in bus spots and in the subway trains , which require a second look .
" Do you travel to the DLR ? " ( Dockland ’ s Light Railway ) reads in the writing types of London Underground and the hallmark of the DLR line , which is transformed into a tank .
In September , a black of arms traffickers with the DLR will drive ... customers are being asked to help break the arms mess .
The 300 posters are of artists who have laid out their work in the museum for cruel design in Banksys ’ s dismaland .
A collectively named Special Patrol Group helped distribute London and used " Ad Space Hack , " a € 6 pack of bus encryphes claiming that " access to around one-third of bus space on the planet . "
Transport to London does not find these playmen , " vandalism . "
One of the parodies indicators produced by Special Patrol Group .
According to Gavin Grindon , the Kurator of Crueol Designs and Dozent at the University of Essex , artists will become more critical and will seek to bring political work outside of galerals .
Many artists work with activists within protest movements , noting that they must move out of the real world to influence their art .
Another of the anti-arms trade players greens the pendulum in the subway .
The amnesty video was seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours through Facebook , and was created by the PCCP , which collaborates with the Grafi and Voiceover-artists , who work freely .
VCCP creativity Director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence surrounding advertising for the rate of arms - by a first-tier of the former CeL calenders - and thought , " Let 's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . "
They played with the invention of a more realistic corporate enterprise , but " it remains more entrenched by the plaintiffs of hate color and anthropy . "
" They have done a fantastic job , " says Tom Davies of Amnesty , by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment . "
What is needed now is a British government crackdown and a guarantee that torture devices will not be illegal on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative arts surrounding the arms race lie within the field of ExCeL , where issuers object to fantastically euphemistic products .
In a press release , Saab exposes a US Army mandate " to the commissioned AT4CS . "
This includes a " uniquely formulated head of fighting that delivers excellent domestic spillover effects . "
Whatever this happens , it will not be pleasant .
Eight Golden Rules for Student Houses
11 years ago , as a self-forgotten 19-year-old , I was still drawn to a student residence , believing in Berets and moral relativism , but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those who I angry – and of the numerous long-breached complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned can be consolidated into eight simple rules .
The entry into university homes ranges from slightly nervous , to utterly terrifying .
It is tempting to gather : people tell where you are headquartered , whether and where you abbage , where you are about Corbyn , and why , " honestly , you don ' t love or hate Marmite , because , in seriousness , boys , it is just one army exhaust HAHAHA , I 'm in my room . "
Attacks .
And help others to do the same – ask and show your interest .
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like , unlike those you wouldn ’ t talk to , even if your wimpanzees broke up and those firedeemed .
Let ’ s leave people .
Humans often turn into cerebrate recipes , film-night events , and municipal councils , but they are also the places where people move and people pull themselves out .
Think about this : don ’ t think about starting an Iron relationship .
Introverted people receive gross treatment at the university .
Their room should be a refuge , but many students ’ habits form a robbery culture that is friendly , socially , and can lead to lifetime friendship .
That may be hell for someone trying to recover .
Nothing in culture allows you to say : " I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you must go away so that I get the energy I have used for interaction . "
Try to see when a fellow combatant of curiosity is exhausted - and you send a SMS instead of crippling it .
Apropos cheered : Tun it .
A candle in my residence had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Freedom sheds through backs .
As you start the uni at the height of the bacilli mania , the crowd to the doors of people to imagine yourself with a seller full of brewnies is less strange than the greening of the 1950-year " next door , I have done something . So , and now ask you , if I ask you a few personal questions . "
offering homegrown leaks is a good way to close friendships .
Their fellow citizens feel obliged to keep themselves , and may end up associating your face with an empty surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Bad mixed clones from Mehl , sugar , and fat make people sleep when you arrive .
Stopping food is a common crime in student homes .
Of course , slaughter clouds are theft , but is it the tapering of milk for your tea ?
Consider the dairy owner .
The chances are that they will say they will service themselves , even if they cook internally .
When someone steals your property , this is annoyant , and you feel compassionate - but try to deal with it more evenly than my fellow inhabitants , who added their milk a medium to punish thieves .
It is now in prison .
They should not shy away from sleep or work .
It is not just about being a decent person , but that you are , literally , one of the people in the glass house .
A girl in my flight asked her neighbors whether it makes them feel a bit lighter to make a pass , because it was three watch tomorrow , and she had a test at the morning .
They responded with even louder music .
After all , when they stopped at 5 p.m. , their neighbors were friendly to sleep two hours before opening their own music , closing their doors , and submitting to their three-hour examination .
Wouldn ’ t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally came into the same residence ?
Conversely , it would not be utterly embarrassing if you have a co-habitant for your future spouse , beat yourself up to them , look at them again every day , and perhaps have to live with how all common friends coalesce ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot fellow man is definitely not your future spouse , you at least try to speak to your dress a bit of reason .
At the exciting moment you notice that someone has made his key in his unclosed room , the line between an ulk and a mobbing one is as it appears .
A good empire is ludicrous , but it takes only moments for it to become a bumper .
Give you a valuable and amusing lesson about security through hiding - but don ' t always fail anyone 's cronies with toothpasta and shampoo .
Look at their door , and tie their key to a glass of water that you make into the freezers - but don ' t dash their meetings at the ceiling twice .
Hospitals for Refugees , single Mothers , Locusts
The real-estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building rickety houses for people with little money .
So , for example , refugees - but also as a signal : " Not only do refugees need housing , but also the single mother and the low-income earner . "
" I show how well to still build today , " says the 44-year-old interview .
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how rapidly to create a low-cost housing area : he is building in a project of travel houses for refugees .
Mr. Gildner , many refugees will push for housing markets .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : The mass institutionalization of containers or tournament has no sustainability .
For people remain largely here .
Given the influx of refugees , we will need enough housing in the next few decades .
A completely banal three-olive rice is the solution .
Gildner : A rice hospital needs the least place .
It facilitates integration .
That is different if people are subjected to residential blocs .
Each of the six houses being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of the four asylum-seekers .
Every residence has two bedroom bedroom , a bad , a kitchen , and a residence room .
It may be that many refugees will say , it is renewed peace ; I go back .
Houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
How high are the costs ?
Gildner – The price of 160 square kilometers of home per house is € 184 , without land .
This is manageable .
Six months has taken time to build .
That is appropriate .
Have construction regulations complicated their plans ?
Gildner : Building legally , I got through my project correctly .
Particularly complicated is the looming Damocles value of special building and proxy .
Gruselig .
Who creates three homes in a rice hospital still needs at least three statements .
Only cities lack the place to do so .
And refugees and asylum-seekers do not have cars .
How have residents responded to their hub project ?
Gildner – There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum-seekers .
What is definitely wrong .
But don ’ t you exacerbate competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : Rightly so : we have had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford anymore .
My project has the message , too , that ordinary people need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low-income earner .
I see how well to build today .
That is what is at stake .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied micro-systems in Regensburg and first studied environmental analysis .
OIS – How you get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is published .
The new operating system can be called upon by going to the hiring app , " to " general , " and then to " software shop . "
When it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download , and then to install .
Some have encountered problems after the installation , because they are given a false report that says that " software updating " has failed .
To circumvent the problem , users are recommended either to wait until the storm declines or to try to update their iTunes .
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
That may mean the lions of apps to make way , but Apple has made it less likely to be able to do so by planting the contingent , using a specific tool , replacing apps , and then reinstalling it once the process is completed .
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged with upgrading , or near a poster device , so that the battery is loaded .
If the shipment is too low , Apple will not allow the Update to continue , as the phone might be halfway off and this could lead to a breakdown of the uphill .
More broadly , despite the WatchOS ’ s delay in reviewing IOS – the least-exciting but the best Update of OS 9 : how you prepare for the new iPhone operating system .
They should also ensure that , before your download , you have watched through our checklist all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting them if they do . IOS brings new functions , including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity feeds for the IPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .
Rosberg ’ s Only Money : Volle Attacks
Nico Rosberg , in the battle for the World Cup ’ s title in the Formel 1 against his clearly leading Mercedles Teamcolor , Lewis Hamilton , has only one currency : “ Volle Attacke . ”
Before the start , the World Cup branch emphasized the crucial seven overseas race , " that I have nothing to lose . "
Fifty-three points divide the vice champion from Singapore ’ s nightmare to its front-page champion Hamilton on Sunday .
The Brite has already won seven of the 12 seasons that it has now enjoyed , and is also a favorite first in the city state to begin the Futzi Grand Prix .
2009 and last year , the 30-year old bride won the race .
Whether the city ’ s current smog will influence the Great Prize of Singapore remains unclear .
For days , a roadblock over the city has been triggered by fires on neighboring Sumatra .
Bad Kissinger ’ s Club has a prominent member
The chess club " founded three months ago , " Bad Kissingen , " added another member to his ranks , increasing membership to 19 players .
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann , a passionate chess and tension player who kept himself in check more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen .
Gauselmann is weaning the federal service cream . Class and honor citizen of the cities of Espelka and Lills .
The Bad Kissingen chess Club supported Gauselmann with a donation to chair Alfred Klein .
It is thus possible to include chess players who can not contribute to member states .
Youth training and talent exploration are also to be pushed forward .
Gauselmann wants to see membership in the chess club , as well as friendly contacts with the tennis " Red White , " as an expression of his attachment to the city .
Quartiersuro searches Direct
Saludis and Antonite ’ s elderly center have merged under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened up a new entrance at the Grave Stauffenberg Square .
Besides consulting , it can take part in Kurds .
Social Foundation draws it from the mountain to the downtown .
More specifically , the Grave Stauffenberg Square .
There , a new Quartillery Office was recently opened .
Here , immediately next to the shopping market , it is here that seniors and raters receive information on issues such as care insurance or benefits for health care and care givers .
For years , we have found our amusing care-giving service that often career loved ones are left alone .
There are infinitely many questions .
" Nor do it rarely take much of the benefits of the coffers , because the complexity of insurance is barely understood , " the new house governor Jutta Weigand , who is also the chief executive , has been responsible for antagonist , civic spital , and amazing " Amadeus . "
But , along with the deliberations , the new Quartillery Office also offers prevention , health , and wastefulness .
That is where the Saludis were bored .
Thus , additional supplies , such as storm prevention , memory training , or physiotherapeutic treatment , can be used .
The offerings from the Senior Center and Saludis are ideally complementary .
Saludis stands for prevention , prevention , and rehabilitation .
" The Senior Center for Safety and Care , " described Heike Riedel , the CEO of Saludis .
The reason for the new Quartillery Office ’ s opening in the downtown is that both business leaders view demographic change particularly .
For this meal is essential for good infrastructure in individual parts of the city of Bamberg in the future .
Moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) emphasized at the celebrations of inclusiveness , the Quartierto Office is devoted to association at old age : " There are many events and offerings on the program , and they are inviting to a regular subset . "
As a result , the social Foundation made a big contribution that seniors can live as individually and well in their familiar environment .
The Quartierso Office is open to Monday , Mittwoch , and Freday Day of 9-14 , Tuesday , and Deputy Day , from 16-18 , and with 30-12 p.m.
Bamberg opposes the overthrow of burger Kickers on October 6 .
Now it is official : having not yet been fixed on the FC ’ s mercharker stadium at the Fucharker Stadium , Bamberg was joined against the third religious friend burger Kickers , October 6 was set as a deadline .
Encounter the FC ’ s entrance into Bamberg in the axis of Bavarian football , Totopokal , against the third religious FC , was finally eliminated .
The Tuesday , October 6 , is being pioneered at the Bamberger Fusparkstadium , at 19 p.m.
" We are glad that we now know when the game is taking place , we now have planning safety , " says CEO teammanager Karlheinz Hümmer , who also points to the now-started mapping sell-off .
It is special for our team to play against a third religious .
So we hope for many viewers , and not without reason , because flash games have special appeal .
In the rounds of the last 16 teams , the FC joined Bamberg in 2010 through victories at township religion 1 FC ( 3 : 1 ) and one at home against the regional Algiers 1 . FC Piurt 05 ( 3 to 2 ) .
The winner of competition receives € 5,000 and qualifies for the DFB ’ s first round in 2016 / 2017 .

Vienna ’ s Architect , Karl Mang , dies 92 Years
Karl Mang , one of the doyens of Vienna ’ s architecture , is dead .
He died on September 5 , at 92 , when the cronies ’ House of Representatives visited the Tuesday .
With Mang , the artist House of Representatives lost a honor , and , as the sensation put it , “ one of the most important architects of the twentieth century in Vienna . ”
Birded in Vienna in 1922 , Mang studied architecture at the tech high school in Vienna during and after World War II at Friedrich Lehmann .
Since 1952 , he has worked as a liberating architect , but has also been a teacher , writer , and institute .
From 1972 to 1983 , he was president of the Austrian forgiveness Institute .
In the 1980 ’ s , he was tasked with setting up Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Vienna Hofburg and converting Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatermuseum .
Parkinsure : Tim Vienese charges Policemen with Money
Ex-football championship Tim Viese has unraveled in Breme .
Football everyone used to be , now Tim Vienese , ex-national leader in Germany , and Bremas and Housm , the rest of us .
According to his own words , 30 kilograms of muscular mass has been seeking over the past two years .
Intellectually , he did not admit .
Viese was just snapping the hair in the city of Bremer Inland when he saw how outside a Parkraum Guardian exchanged a penalty sentence for his white Chevrolet Camaro .
Viese then stormed out of business , insulted the civil servant , and accused her of maturing fines , as the " image " newspaper reports .
In the city of Breme , the charges are confirmed , but not yet clear the consequences for the unusual incident .
" The matter is still in testing , " says Bremas .
Only after will it be reported whether or not will Viese be shown .

Men Beat 17-Year Afghans
Take the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmonster : at the Friday Age , against 23,45 , three young men went to the foot of Bad Soden for salmon .
One of the group , a seventeenth-century old Afghans , reportedly followed his two friends by the police in a distance of about five meters , and told them to wait for him .
At that point , the group was at the peak of the bandits .
Three people also stood up on the tankers ’ assets .
One of these men now shouted the youths , and beat them in the face .
The victim suffered a nascent breakout , and he flourished hard .
When his two friends rushed and spotted on the thugs , he initially abandoned his victim .
His friends have now brought the injured young man home .
The perpetrator followed the group with a Pkw until her apartment , and was demonstrably missed there .
When one no longer saw the vehicle , injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
There , he was again attacked by the plaintiffs and another male person .
Under a surge of assistance , it was examined in the face and colonels of the victim .
The injured had to be put into hospital for medical care .
So far , there is only one vague description .
One of the men was about 1.80 feet large .
The second thug was to have been about 1.65 meters big , and was plagued with a jean and a brown white shirt .
Police officials ask witnesses and hints to register under the telephone number of 6061 / 100-123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over and invests € 310,000
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over Karl Heinrich ’ s practice .
There is also a pleasure of wild debtors , Bernd Bormann , economic promotion in Uta Seim-Schwartz , and Asendorf ’ s mayor , Heinfried Kabbert .
In many places in the country , doctors are absent - Asendorf is lucky : on October 1 , Dr. Frank Muller takes over the field .
As hotspots retire , her husband , Karl-Heinrich , sits halfway with his successor in the next few months .
After a rebuilding phase , Müller is reopening the practice on October 12 , when he invests € 310,000 in the wheels on the St.-Marcellus-Street 6 .
It was sympathetic at first glance when the field stations of Frank Müller and whose wife , Dr. Silvia , met Müller-Gongoll , who is graduating from pediatric education to hospital , and who will also enter into practice next year .
" We have always had in mind that the rubble would fit into this practice , " says Dr. Ursel .
" When it did , I just called it . "
The idea of conducting its own practice in Asendorf was a few rubber-stampers .
" Proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , " says the 39-year-old trash .
" We want to learn and accompany families over the years . "
He also sees himself as an asset to be his own leader soon .
So they agreed that the revelers bought the house with the practice .
Where , however , they will continue to be in brokerage villages .
There , the family ’ s twice father , Frank Müller , has also grown up , followed by several drug boxes , and hospitals in Sulingen , Nienburg , and Rotenburg .
He is now a chief doctor , far down the road to a Diepholz emergency doctor in 2009 , and is engaged honorably in the DRC ’ s willingness to build breast houses and villages .
From September 19 th , practice will be prepared for the new leader .
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich works as a house doctor , his gattin Ursel ( Internistin ) specializes in host rationology .
The veilers , both intermediaries , want to be settled as local doctors .
" Endoskopia is thus quick , " says Silvia Müller-Gongoll , 38-year-old Silvia .
As it is rebuilt , trees will look more modern .
We will offer more ultrasound research , long-term , and stress KGB , and we will need a spokesperson more .
Moreover , the EDV is being totally renewed .
A € 50,000 grant , in a landlocked grant program ( € 25,000 ) and the Samtmentary Community ( € 12500 ) and the community ( $ 12500 ) .
" This shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , " says Samtgenerist Bernd Bormann .
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll , about 2,000 patients enter the field every quarter , and the average German practice is around 500 .
There is another housewife practice in Asendorf .
A positive side effect of the Prax takeover by Frank Müller is that the apotheoke remains , according to the rogue station in Asendorf .
If no successor had been found , she would have gone .
Those who visit Müllers continue to see , incidentally , the most familiar face : seven medical professionals and cleanup power from the field .
With their departure , Asendorf ends an era , and the doctors have practiced it for 30 years .
" At the beginning , we have had only two rooms , " the authors remind themselves to be painted .
They feel a little sorry after a long time .
" But we live even further in high mosor , " says the hidebound . "
Additionally , " We have a 6000-square meter land . "
" So far , I have always shied away from horse-work ; now that may be different . "
Moreover , the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel .
Croatia : " We Let Refugee the Refugees
" Now border controls are being extolled on our southern border , " said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner .
Controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
It remains clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do so " naturally . "
People ’ s security and security matters .
But it is also clear that " clear signals are needed , " the minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , including the Austria-Slovenia border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering " Corridor " - Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously been telling it , including Slovenia , which wants to keep refugees moving to Austria and Germany , and may also create corridors for refugees .
So , however , did Interior Minister Vesna GyörK ’ s tongues in Laibach .
The idea of corridors is " utterly unacceptable " ; Slovenia will intensify surveillance of the border , particularly Hungary .
But the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the Schengen Area ’ s outbreak .
As the minister emphasized , Slovenin does not want to sever his borders for refugees .
" Any EU member state must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system can not work , " stressed in GyörK 's nights .
As the Croatian government has indicated , in the after-hours to Tuesday , the first refugees have already attempted to take over in eastern Croatia on the border of Tovarnik / Sid to evade registration .
Croatian police could use them in the nearby corn fields .
According to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatian Tovarnik .
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans , many of whom are women and children .
Bailout services and the Red Cross are already in operation as well .
In the coming days , his country expects about 4,000 refugees , Minister of Home Affairs Ranko Ostojic said .
Moreover , on the Mazedoni-Serbian border that previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , buses from Presevo would be diverted to Croatia , Croat and Serbian media reported on the Mittwin .
The government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is wise for people to take certain routes : " neither can nor do we want to . "
According to media reports , a first bus of roughly 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid occurred in the early days , with more buses expected .
From Croatia , Slovenia , and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on the way all night from Serbia ’ s roughly 500 kilometers away .
" We have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said we should drive this , " said one of the refugees .
They wanted to continue to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia , and Austria .
Indeed , it may now be the somewhat more Western scare of the predicted postponement by observers of Turkey ’ s previous Balkans route to Greek Macedonia ’ s Serb Hungarians .
Croatia : " Comprehensive Border-Control possibilities "
Croatia ’ s interior minister , Ostojic , had earlier stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptions if a large influx of refugees arrived .
He did not name details , but he pointed out that Croatia , a non-Schengen member , has " extensive border-control possibilities . "
They conduct strict controls to qualify for Schengen membership .
Slovenia has belonged to it since 2007 , with EU partners consistently issuing a good testament to the standard of border controls .
On the Serbian side , some 300 refugees remain trapped behind Hungary ’ s border fence .
According to Belgrade ’ s media reports , they would have spent the past night on the border crossing Horgos , leading to the rogue .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain utterly blocked .
Whether the remaining refugees will want to travel to the Croat border remains unclear .
Serbia ’ s interior minister , Nebojsa Stefanovic , attempted to calm Mittweek early in a local villain in Horgos : he considered the debates about the aging routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed , premature .
It would not now be very large refugee numbers .
One can not yet say whether they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia , or other countries .
Migrants to Refugees – Dangerous Alternative-Route
But private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the map of refugees receiving alternative rounds .
But the Serbia border crossing with Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still unearthed fields 20 years after the Croatia War ended .
On Mittweek ’ s afternoon , Croatian police announced that a minesweeping team was sent to the border region .
Exchange Hackers : Ukrainians Pay $ 30 million
Supported by a ray of cyber criminals accused of always gaining sight into or unpublished financial reports and press releases on Web sites such as Business Wire , Marketwired , and PR newswire since 2010 .
The information used to be used to make insider-trading in financial markets .
In this way , the investigators ’ total emissions totaled more than $ 100 million .
" Today 's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will eventually be trapped , " says the SECC .
The case against 32 other charges lasted .
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
Ecumenical Hospieniy Mannheim has been around for 20 years .
Around the Mannheimer Square , operations are real .
People are anxious , sometimes speedy , to some of their concerns .
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer ’ s auto salute on the paradise square .
City routes hold .
Pulsifying , clashing life in glass , and with four big pockets each with the headline , " I want to die before me .... "
Ecumenical hospice aid has made the move attentive to its 20-year operation , and faces mixed reactions .
" Life is about , so we have gone to the middle of the city and to the people , " Josefine Lammer says .
The head of ecumenical hospice aid is available to the passersby for issues and talks , as are honorable staff .
While some passerant draws spontaneously into the circle and reads the phrase " my life years , " " reading , " " with which America 's camps drive , " " and " do not end the war , " others remain short , read , say , phrase like " I 'm not yet , " and go on .
Small debates about action itself , about life , about how to deal with death , continue to unravel .
Peter Hübinger is also located .
" Only when I make it clear that someday the end of this world can I live responsibly , " says the director of the Diakonan Worker Mannheim , who is together with the Caritasband of Ecumenical Hospice .
As a result , this public-relations effort is good for the 20-year-old .
But it is understandable , after all , that not everyone wants to tell the smoke and mirrors publicly ; after all , it is very personal .
The topic of death and death remains taboo , as Joseph Lammer ’ s experience suggests , though the hospice movement in recent years has done much to make people open .
An assessment shared by Angelia Godefroid .
The death and trauma accompany is among the honorable first-hour staff .
Faced with personal experience with the issue , they read a lot literature and chose to engage in euthanasia .
When ecumenical hospice aid was a call for honor , it immediately registered itself , and was present at its founding in 1995 .
Godefiniroid is a team of 45 honor officials - 43 women and two men - who accompany fraud and family in households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hospice Vincent .
Everyone owes them carefully .
Angelia Godefroid can do well with her task , and with the experience and experience that he created .
" I see life from another perspective , consider it precious , and estimate the moment , " she says .
The offer of Bulgarian ecumenical hospice service is free and sectarian .
The financial support of health workers and family donations enables training , training , and supervisions of mortality and grievances .
Every two years , new employees offer training .
The sheep described on Saturday are now published in the Home of the evangelical Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
There , too , more personal wishes can be traded on post cards .
Mixed Financial Prospects for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant cut its profit sight for a year , owing to weaker demand for women ’ s services and higher costs in its boat transportation services .
The company also said that it plans to hire about 5,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
At this point last year , FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time .
The stock market fell more than 2.5 % on premium trading for 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
FedEx Corp. said that he earned a profit between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May , 20 cents less than the previous prediction .
Analysts , according to a survey by FactSet , expected $ 10.84 .
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases that are averaging 4.9 % and that will take effect on January 4 , and that , despite higher bottom-up attacks , will be severe and large packages imposed since November .
The company said that it was nonetheless expected that the outcome would rise year after year , owing to lower costs , higher revenues , and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will produce " solid returns when considered the weaker economy than expected , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . "
Plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
In the quarter , which ended on August 31 , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 % more than it did last year .
As a result , $ 2.42 per share was just below $ 2.44 per share , which the twelve analysts surveyed by the investment research predicted .
The sales rose 5 % , to $ 12.3 billion .
Six Zacks surveyed analysts expected $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priorities in recent years , which has staggered sales in his unity of expressions .
But the online shopping boom has boosted FedEx Ground ’ s results .
In the last quarter , sales of boat transport rose 29 % , but the operational result was essentially flat , owing to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
The expressions unit recorded higher revenues , owing to higher prices , while the result was a decline in questionable labor costs .
In preposter-trade , for example , an hour before openness , hedge exchanges fell by $ 3.85 , or 2.5 % , to $ 150.15 .
On Tuesday , it lost 11 % for the year and 17 % below a record high on June 11 .
At their most anticipated meeting in the years , the Federal Reserve is spending strategists two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagonian table to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Threats about them to end the forbidden two-tier session is a watershed image of the United States .
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation ’ s economic interests ahead of everything else .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximize US employment and price stability .
But , since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate may be the Xi factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . It is known on Donbas whether the US economy is rigid to be weaned off by the unprecedented incentive provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the Fed ’ s already-cautious representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – and by only a quarter .
" Obviously , the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they see , " said Lindsey M. Piegza , chief economist at the macro-firm Nicolaus & Co .
" But I think they look for an excuse not to raise the interest rate , " she said , " the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global market is sufficient justification .
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do about what itself is unsettling the financial market .
Roughly half of the economists asked recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week .
Financial markets , however , expect the Fed to wait , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance to increase .
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate , unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase will be far away .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial value jumped by 28.89 , or 1.4 % , to 16.59.85 .
The move was triggered by expectations that the Fed ’ s policy will uphold this week , John London , the chief economist at Moody ’ s Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates at that point , ” he said .
If it does , " it would have to go very far in its statement to reassure financial markets , lest they panic . "
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets , because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed poised to raise this month ’ s 0.25 percentage points rate , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery .
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that , despite complaints by liberals that more economic progress was needed , she expected the sentence to rise this year .
Although job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labor market this year was solid .
Unemployment fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years , and close to Lega , which the Fed regards as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And , while inflation has persistently been below the central bank ’ s 2 % annual target , the Fed ’ s representatives have said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy " can manage higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market , " said Ian Shepdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But financial markets around the world added together at the end of last month , after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 16 % below its peak in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in China ’ s economy would reduce global growth .
The market has recovered this month , with the Dow now nearly 10 % below the high of May .
For Fed representatives , market turmoil affects the complex calculation when to raise interest rates .
" If financial events and news of the Chinese economy 's weakness had not occurred in the last few weeks , " Stephen D. Oliners , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA , and a former Fed staff official , said .
Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to manage the impact better .
" There is much uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , " said Oliners .
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed ’ s main concerns , so it should not be technical in its decision-making .
But , in the end , the Fed has become the world ’ s monetary authority .
The central bank ’ s influence has been enormous in recent years .
Back in 2013 , then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’ s mere suggestion that the Fed could “ close its monetary expansion ” triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , Fed representatives can be expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision-making is " more arts than science , " said Zachary Karabell , the head of the global strategy for corporate wealth management , Envestnet Inc .
As Jeffrey Lacker , President of the Federal Reserve of Richmond , observed this month , " the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial-market movements that seem intimately linked to economic fundamentals . "
Lacker , a valid member of the Federal Open Market Committee , called for a rate hike , cited decisions in 1998-1999 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings , " despite a limited impact on US growth , " Lacker said .
A year later , Fed representatives reversed these cuts .
The Fed should take the lead in financial stability only during a severe crisis , such as the 2008 market breakdown , Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Bank of England ’ s Governing Committee .
The recent turmoil does not come close to that level , he said .
" She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she feared a rate hike because the markets are inciting , " says Posen , President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual mandate , and it does not mention financial stability until it is changed , and I do not believe that it should come to the fore .

Parken – LAX-C has its own parking holdings , along with other stores and restaurants .
Even if the Laden is well visited , finding a parking square is not hard .
Hoyersda : Small Life for Refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days .
Creating a warm will is not without the commitment of countless honorable public aides .
There are also a number of people who support impersonal asylum-seekers in the city in Hoyerswerda .
These include Petra and Klaus Hein .
Petra Hein is a teacher with body and soul .
Even with their 74 lines , she still likes to teach her .
Each Thursday , it does it on the dillinger Strait in asylum holiday .
It helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo , and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course , this is very different from teaching from a right school .
Brazil ’ s Pearly-Diatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Food for Sestitution
SPRS , Brazil ’ s pediatric organization , is shocking in trying to educate women about the importance of nutrition during breastfeeding time , with the presentation of images of babies who suck in breastfeeding with portrayals of unhealthy foods .
Mutual milk consists of a variety of proteins , chains , vitamins , and carbohydrates , all of which babies give to the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
Given the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers will be advised to increase daily calories by about 500 calories per day .
But new research indicates that higher calorie imports are not the only diaetic adaptation that mothers should make .
A recent study headed by Robert Waterland , a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of weaker women actually concerns their babies ’ genes and protects them from developing tumors .
Unfortunately , childhood diets can negatively affect the immune system .
Excepting the New Bernriefing Sporthall
The council , Bernried , approved the € 2.3 million construction bid for expensive sports .
And it was an exception .
The roadside is to make solar panels flat .
Plans for the long-desired turnover construction at Bernrieder Sports are stepping forward : the processed construction application was welcomed without much discussion at the most recent meeting .
Before that , among other things , the Panel had adopted a request for a compulsory " exemption " from the existing construction plan .
" Except " was about permission for a special form in terms of de-construction .
Thus , a " Sattday of non-identical First and Druze " is to be constructed .
With the planning in mind , the proposed use of the surface for solar panels is : " This brings us a wonderfully large South Asia together , " says Mayor Joseph Stranger at the meeting .
" Liberation " was , in turn , less than ten degrees of suspicion for enlightened reasons , unlike the construction plan .
This sharply reduces the volume of dogs .
" Liberation " was necessary because the amendment plan of suspicion does not permit " exceptions , " with the community 's writers typically more restrictively fed up in liberation councils .
But this is not a recurring project : " We don ' t set a precedent , " he says , " .
Turnaround at the sports center is a joint project by the community and the SV Bernried .
At a cost , roughly € 2.3 million is calculated .
Simple grants are expected to be sports promotion .
In the next step , the 18-meter construction bid is now submitted to the countryside office for review .
Klinik Peiberg Goes to Schongau
The hospital is supposed to be closed earlier than planned – 2016 .
At the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the hospital .
The station and majority of staff relocate from Peiberg to Songau .
This calls for the hospital ’ s surprising plans from the countryside that Andrea Jochner White confirmed .
But the board makes a decision , and September 23 is doomed on the next Wednesday .
If plans are implemented , all of the close to 50 workers at the hospital in Peiberg would be kept employed .
The overwhelming majority should move with Fischer and the remaining interior station to Schongau .
The spaces are available .
According to Jochner ’ s White White , the non-workforce who can not be employed by Schongau is supposed to be offered a job in Weilheim .
The staff is informed about plans .
The change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder , the director of the Songauer clinic only since the beginning of the year and now a private practice near the hospital .
According to Jochner 's white , the name " Fischer " came into play , agreeing to take the lead on October 1 with his team to switch to Schongau .
For the house in Schongau , this meant " appreciation " and " broadening the supply of " domestic medicine , " says Jochner White .
Fischer is a specialist of heart makers and deficit brigades .
Schongau ( 180 beds ) is specialized in terms of gastrointestinal diseases .
Translating for the next two years , if the board agrees to both houses , Fischer is to be shut down after almost 140 years in the hill by next year ’ s hospital , which still has 35 beds .
So far , the countryside has planned this for 2018 , when remediation at pasturelands is completed at the hospital .
Land council Jochner White , who also heads the board , recounted that the house in possession of the federal shortage should be used as a future shelter for asylum-seekers .
" I finish it . " As the home goes on , Jochner ’ s whence could not say , there are several considerations .
There is now a short-term care for the Caritas and a day-to-day psychiatry .
" What the better we could not do , such an opportunity won ' t happen again , " Fischer said of the quasi-retreat to the Lech , " welcome and comprehensible " by the staff .
There has been no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chemist for more than 30 years .
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the doctor ’ s job .
The hospital of Peirurberg ( once 100 beds ) has been under constant threat of closure in recent decades , with departments closed , such as surgery and birth aid .
Today , the handmaids of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are calling for evening ( 20.15 p.m. ) at the Bergian HC .
While the German tablets ’ tobacco leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , no one is in overbearing .
Last season , the BHC ’ s Bavarians mounted a painful defeat , and have had some credit for it .
Hunting Two injured Losses in Pratau
Two trawler drivers have been badly injured by shots during their corn crop Day .
During a cortebrate field in Pratau ( the countryside of Wittenberg ) , several hacks were involved , as the police said .
After a gun levy , a 63 and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospitals .
How exactly the accident could occur was initially unclear .
The criminal police are identified .
The Rhineland Pfalz ’ s Field 16-year-old Victims of Violence Crimes
A criminal offense has led police to the body of 16-year-olds missing since Saturday from Rheinland-Pfalz .
In interrogation , the 20-year-old woman admitted that the young were killed and thrown their bodies into a canal in rock skin .
A 16-year-old leader from Rheinland-Pfalz who has been missing since Saturday has been a victim of violent crime .
Young women ’ s suffering was found at the Tuesday Day in Rockensen in Emperor Lords , as prosecutors and police shared on Wednesday .
An idiosyncratic figure is also held at the service of a 20-year-old official who , according to the act , stood by and led the mediators to the founding of the body .
The 16-year-old had been missed on Sunday ’ s morning , after not coming home as agreed upon on the eve of a visit to rock rocks .
In search of the young woman , the investigators initially encountered personal objections from the victim .
Finally , surveys of the missing have been met with suspicion against the 20-year-olds .
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in rock tournaments where the body was found .
The detention , according to the authorities , gave police interrogation , killed 16-year-olds , and placed the body in the canal .
The 20-year-old should be carried out on Wednesday to the imprisoner who investigators place his death toll on him .
Indeed , disclosure of the approximate circumstances is intended to bring further investigations .
Refugees Need Houses : Studies warn of Housing Gap
The German housing market is vulnerable .
More and more refugees are also seeking affordable meat .
Pressure in the housing market is mounting .
Social housing faces a challenge .
The distributional struggles in Germany ’ s housing market have long begun .
With refugees and EU workers arriving , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many large cities .
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing .
By 2020 , 400,000 new units would have to be built each year to meet demand for affordable housing .
As a result , a study commissioned by the association of " social housing . "
For comparison , 260,000 units are being completed in Germany this year .
As a result , 140,000 homes are missing .
Refugees , after the first three months of residence , are no longer obliged to live in an initial shelter for asylum .
Many then enter the housing market and long lines in their rental homes .
According to the State Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum-seekers were at rent last year .
The negative development of the housing market , however , lies not only in the rising numbers of refugees .
The study also accounts for significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years .
Germany is poised to run a housing deficit that will widen from year to year .
Currently , around 70,000 housing units were missing in the population area , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
Many professionals , therefore , lived in large cities in the World Cup heaven .
Young adults remained unwillingly longer in the " hotel Mama " because of the housing downturn .
In large cities , square kilometers per capita have fallen for the first time in recent years .
To solve the problem , the Alliance proposes a reset of " social housing . "
New incentives are intended to revive social housing .
Thus , the Green Company Tax could be eliminated , and property taxes on owner-occupied housing could be extinguished .
Moreover , tax deductions , according to an alliance , would be necessary .
The State Bank ’ s refugee backing program already plays well in cities and communities .
A good week after the start , € 184 million had already been written off more than half of the roughly € 300 million at the month ’ s end .
Now the project may even be scaled up .
Refugees are Free : Croatia and Slovenia Create Corridor
After Hungary , all but one can no longer get through , as more and more refugees choose the road through Croatia .
Zagreb announces that it will travel to the North through Slovenia without hurdles .
But the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to agree with neighboring Slovenia to establish a corridor for refugees .
" I spoke to Slovenia 's interior minister , and , when necessary , we will organize a corridor , " said Croat Interior Minister Ranko Ostoyic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria , and is already a Schengen zone .
The EU 's Croatia country is not yet a Schengen country .
Hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe , following the shutdown of the Serb Hungarian border .
500 people had reached the Tovarnik border , the Croat TV channel RTL reports .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees the previous day .
New laws enacting that same day , moreover , virtually make asylum procedures virtually redundant in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let refugees happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said , " You can travel , and we are preparing for that possibility . "
These people are there , women , children , and men who want to live and achieve something .
But they were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
Croat police seized the first refugees on Serbia ’ s border with the EU ’ s neighbors Croatia by the morning .
According to most media reports , Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan come from .
They came to the Serbian border with both bus and taxis .
Immediately after arriving , they would have tried to gain foothold over the green border to Croatia .
On the Croati-Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border fences .
There are other risks to the border : there are sharp mines of Yugoslavia ’ s civil war in the 1990 ’ s .
Plumbers are now intended to create a safe passage quickly .
After Hungary , however , there are few more refugees after closing the border .
On Tuesday , police counted 366 people .
Shortly before the monday ’ s Torture , it had been 9380 .
The new Hungarian law classifies overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime .
So 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in Szeged , the southern border city .
Prisons were sentenced to up to five years in prison and the expulsion from the country .
According to the Immigration Agency , the Tuesday in the newly established " transit zones " in total 94 asylum applications , almost all of which - 93 - were the most important transition .
Among its applicants , 13 families with young children and two elderly are .
On Mittweek tomorrow , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
In practice , however , no one has any prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
According to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a “ safe third country . ”
The asylum-seekers who are defeated are to be deported .
Before the " transit zone " entered the rogue , only a few hundred refugees gathered .
In Racizk , workers are beginning to clean up .
They gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the street in recent weeks .
Sperrgitter was dismantled , and one of the camps was rebuilt on the frontier .
No one wanted to speak out for the switch .
Austria , after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , is reaching few refugees .
It has also reinforced its border controls .
But the 20,000 migrants still survived in the country , according to government accounts .
In Salzburg , some 1,400 people are waiting for Germany to move forward .
The movement from there to Germany was stopped on the previous day by instructing German authorities .
In release , smaller groups of refugees routinely took root .
Mayors Divided the Limits
" We were preoccupied with the cleanup after the bridge cruise on Sunday , when ten people with rice seconds suddenly stood in the square , " according to Wernstone 's mayor Aloi 's city classmates .
Tourists wanted them to travel to Passau .
But , because Germany stunned railroad traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees , they concluded in Wernstein , " he said , “ the city leaders immediately offered their help , and the stranded , along with two other aides and their cars , traveled across the border with the Middle East Passau .
Previously , we sucked the unexpected guests , with their homes and beaches .
We have said the same , we get them to Passau .
" That was for us , " says the Oil talks .
They were grateful .
One man was not taken to give generous donations - $ 100 for the fire department .
" That pleased us , " says the city .
The stranded passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional passenger on Sunday ’ s evening night to a short term announcement that railroad traffic has been stopped to Germany , but has yet to try across the border .
But the regional move was dismissed before the Inn border in Wernstein .
In Wernstein , the overall cross border is high on track .
The bridge was blurred with Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , tags of a two-way exercise – organized by the Union Wernstein and New Bavarians .
That Viktor Orbán is now sending another tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypocritical policies :
Instead of immediately helping to build structures that ensure humanity in the camp of Röszke , our chancellor has become highly official and public in the Hungarian government ’ s position in the orbit of Nazism .
The problem with this policy is not just that of Austria , who now faces chaotic conditions in the border areas .
The displaced will also find that the " promised land " that they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp .
The challenge will be great , given the continuing influx of refugees and the impending winter , to reach dignified conditions for protection .
And it will be an even greater one - to sustain peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad , searching for 35,000 Well-Five Quarters
Konrad has all his hands to do with refugee shelter .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word having weight .
The government has used the former powerful Raizi banker to create articles for the thousands of refugees .
The chaos at the first entry center of Traiskirchen has already gripped Konrad .
" We don ' t have homeless people in Traiskirchen , " he told his first success .
Housing the 20,000 refugees who had arrived to Austria on Monday also said Konrad , praising the organizational " feat . "
The interior ministry spoke of a " crisis " situation .
Overall , Konrad expects 85,000 quarters in this year .
To meet the figure , 35,000 housing will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 to provide countries , 15,000 of the federal population .
If more refugees become refugees , we can do it .
" But it is not a barrage without soil , " Konrad said .
He has already held talks with the national capital .
They would have told him to create the sort of trickle for the coming refugees as well .
" It 's a good thing , " Ferry Maier said .
Former PPP mandate supports Konrad .
Tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help .
Great expectations include the asylum coordinator in the ORF operation of " heroes like us . "
In the field , private individuals can offer uncomplicated housing .
They also hope to hotels who are empty in winter .
Konrad and Maize criticized yesterday 's standards for housing as " very high . "
In times of distress , quartiers may not have to comply with some degree of discretionary or superstition .
For a temporary period , " emergency standards " would have to be applied .
That , unlike the interior ministry , he was more successful at home with his experience .
I am an older master who can not be told the untruth without more .
persuasive power is his main weapon .
Konrad and Maires do not cost the Republic as they explained themselves .
They want to increase their workforce to 3-4 .
So far , one ’ s own squalor search has not succeeded .
Konrad wanted to create a container at the Stephanlato Square .
But there seem to be problems with approval .
Linz calls for Better Divide
For the moment , the city of Linz is not opening up to urban sports thals and other buildings , such as Tips-Arspace and designs centers .
This is not necessary right now , because they can currently be brought to the table without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) .
But , in the event of emergency , more sites are to be tested for their dishonesty .
Critics are criticized by the city ’ s leader in dividing refugees within the country .
Other districts , too , must play their part .
Seemeries : " Limits are not Dismantled "
In a longer telephone with Bavaria ’ s Prime Minister Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) , the country ’ s chief executive Joseph Pühringer ( PP ) corresponded further on Monday to the refugee issue .
Semites have reassured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
Continuing refugees to the Federal Republic remains possible .
But it is here that there are corresponding border controls .
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the first time .
But the protectors would be brought to Germany with regular moves .
Other EU member states once again called for greater solidarity on refugees .
That Austria , too , is now reintroducing controls on its borders is a `` logical consequence ' ' of what the Germans are doing .
The Next Runtastic is a Time Question
The remediation of " New Values " in the Linzi Industrial Age is officially complete .
In four of the six stock works of the office and manufacturing building , the publicly traded IT & T company is to be consulted , with the rest ( 2700 square meters ) mixed to young , innovative technology companies .
" In IT , smart heads are our commodity - and we must try to work for us , " says S & T chief Hannes .
He could conceivably invest in start-up firms , and then take them into account .
From the outset , S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors – something that the House of Lords promises , " The next Runtastic is only a matter of time . "
€ 1.7 million was invested by S & T in location , $ 3.3 million by the techno-center , which is home to one-third of Linz , the country ’ s Colonel Empire , and the federation ( FFG ) .
The building is scrapped by the Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and the techno-center .
30 % of the 2700 square kilometers of buildings are already avoided , and there are questions about another 40 % .
The Second Arcade Business of Lia-Peroni Inhabitants
The new shop is centered on splash handbags .
In fact , Jutta tried to strike a dog .
The proposal recently postponed Lia Peroni , the 49-year-old inhabitant in the Tau-Market Arcade : after all , she has now gained gains in the form of another business local .
In the Sport Shop against the business , where it sells pockets , suits , shoes , and custores of various manufacturers , the brand Spla is all about dams trades of money , starting with € 75 .
Larger pockets and Accessoires cost up to € 500 .
The new shop in operation has been yesterday .
Previously , several weeks was rebuilt .
" But I have long wondered if I should still open a store , " says blue .
The key determinant of the decision was that the sport manufacturers who are home in Bologna were also attracted by the idea of their own location , which sells only their handbags .
" We are the only people in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand , " says the mother of two daughters who even Italian roots .
Their mode interest has been put from her mother to the cradle .
I am most adapted when something develops and I show new trends at affordable prices .
Why some women , looking at a beautiful handshake , can not answer last-resort .
Perhaps it is because a beautiful pocket upgrades every output .
The Kallstadt Brullesmaker
Donald Trump ’ s ponderant ancestors came from a place whose residents are called recruiters .
Some also connect with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for an excuse .
Whether he speaks xes xenophobic , journalists rub , or reveal gaps in knowledge in international crisis politics , the candidate for the US presidency is campaigning vigorously .
And it does well .
This is also registered in the pilgrimage of the home , where the grandparents come from billions of dollars .
The New Yorker , with a high nose , is a term many in the winter village on the street .
Some in the 1200-location are over - tens of corners are related to him .
His grandfather came out of the dark town : Donald Trump , in the campaign mode .
The city city city changer Simone Wendel turned a movie about Trump .
And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
" I think this is somehow exciting , but not so deeply impressed in their crystal manner , " says Simone Wendel .
The native city city has turned an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous slumps , which , along with Trump , also counts the Ketchup family Heinz .
Trump , not known for modesty , also speaks to " Kings of Kallstadt " ( 2014 ) , saying that he would surely succeed if he were living in the city of Kallstadt .
He has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
While there is respect for the family 's performance , there is also a tendency to believe that Trump " is already a little big stick , " says Wendel .
accidentally , the nickname that Kallstadt has around him is " The Brulljesmaker " - too German , the employee says .
Trump thus comes from the village of the employee .
Trump 's success story began in 1885 , when the former grandfather emigrated and in the US opened a logal to gold graves .
At the heart of the real-estate firm was the first land purchases in New York .
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland indefinitely failed in the Bavarian state , which was the myth of which it was then .
He did not admit Trump because he was once wasted without permission , the director of the Institute for Prudential History and Volkskround , Roland Paul , had declared the film start .
Trump is the grandson of an " illegal immigrant . "
This contrasts with the sometimes markedly testimony of the offspring .
This had repeatedly spoken forcefully about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
" This is not so appealing , " says Hans-Joachim Bender , a remote relative to Trump ( " The Oma was a born Trump , the Opa was born Heinz . " )
The winter in retirement is rather distant to Americans , " he is always so burning . "
Does he believe that Trump comes from ?
" I can not imagine this , " says the 72-year-old .
" He never caved about the city . "
The pension scientist Veronika Schramm , like some Kallstadter , mentions that , on a visit to Heinz family , a composition ended up for the church bullets , which is generally a good thing to do .
" I can not imagine this from Donald , " says the 68-year-olds .
They would do better if he did not know the election , because " he has such radical views , I don ' t know if it is good . "
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US were like him , " he would never have come there . "
" There are more interesting issues than him , " says windmills of Sarah Bühler .
As president ?
" My president is not , " she says .
And “ The mourning will be ripe without the President Trump . ”
Wendel ’ s film , long interviewed by Trump , has seen 12,000 mothers , including in the US .
The upper Bavarian town of Ramsau at Berchtesgades is Germany 's first " mineral increase . "
From the German Alpenverine ’ s vice-president ’ s hand , Ludwig Wucherennig , the 1800-member village received the award for soft tourism in the national mountain park park village on Wednesgades .
Austria already has 20 " mountain villages . "
In neighboring countries , the retirement penalty is responsible for giving the award .
A " mineral village " must have at most 2500 people .
At least one-fifth of its area must be sheltered .
Seven ’ s Sunnis crisis dominates ratings , despite attempts by Nine to take over the loss of leadership in the current show .
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are rushing to Canberra to report after the loss of liberals ’ leadership , but no major shift in ratings has occurred .
Nine ’ s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull abolished Tony Abbott .
The rival Sunnis crisis , with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was part of a weekly series of international TV shows in London , including Dubai , New York , Niagara , fall , and Cancun .
This disadvantage seemed to be unimportant for Australian TV viewers , because the Sunni crisis averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to Today ’ s 39,000 .
Today , there was a slight increase from ratings for Monday ( 317,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) , but its figure lagged behind that of last Thursday ( 343,000 ) .
Today ’ s Sunnis crisis has closed the gap in recent months .
In August , Today averaged 318,000 , compared to the 330,000 Sunnis crisis .
At the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September , the Sunni crisis has averaged 349,000 viewers , 314,000 at Today .
This is the most interesting thing happens every morning .
The winds of change affect these dawn people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are right , thank for scrutiny !
TODAY wrote about Monday , September 14 , 2015 .
The big news for Seven was the impressive rebuke of 800 words with the former star of Packed to the Rafter Erik Thomson .
The new drama about a recently wooden father who chooses to settle with his two children on the coast of Neuseeland reached an impressive 1.219 million viewers .
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a Hitler show Solo without the Rafter Star Rebecca Gibney .
Yesterday 's outcome answered this with a clear " yes . "
Seven ’ s X-factor stayed at 1.136 million , and easily defeated The Block ( 838,000 ) and TBL Families ( 726,000 ) .
Seven had mixed results on evening by The Chase Australia .
The first half-hour ( 17,000-1730 ) of the new Quiz-Show , moderated by Andrew O ' Keefe , averaged 46,000 viewers .
The second half-hour ( 17 : 30 : 18-00 ) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat ( 613,000 ) .
On the monday end , the first half hour of The Chase Australia received 520,000 viewers , and 720,000 in the second half hour .
Hot-Seat averages 620,000 .
The decline in the quota in The Chase Australia ’ s second evening will probably vote Nine confidently that the Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
The Chase Australia is a substitute for millions of dollars that failed to overtake McGuires ’ show .
The Originally Legal Crisis
The last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man , but who will vote ?
Did secrets reveal ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows , Sarah Mackay , and Snezana Markoski may not have been sure who wins The Bachelor .
The wife who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was shut down in greatest secrecy .
And none of the three girls left will certainly not surrender whether she is the last betrayal .
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski , and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before coming to two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will win .
Sam Wood keeps its lists shut until the Douthday Final
All three women have studied in a lyrical way why Wood is the perfect man , calling his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitudes as reasons why they want to be their partner .
However , if the question is asked , " If not you , who should get Bretton Woods last Rose ? " their answers may become spoilers of the game , who won the heart of the battery .
Yavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - save for themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
" From the moment I went home and ( Sarahs ) and Sams felt energy , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought it all over the show , " Jeavons-Fellows said .
" Sarah coalesced with both feet on earth , it makes so much pleasure to be with her , " Markosky added .
I saw it together , and they have the right chemistry .
They feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood are good Paar .
In their view , Mackay said that last week 's home visit to her made it clear that Wood could be " the One . "
" As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is not just a game - I am now unconditional on him , " she said .
And when she was asked who should vote Wood , if not , was puzzling .
" I don ' t know if I can say it , " she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana .
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19-30 , on Ten .
Initially , as Sarah ’ s first election for Sam Wood ?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL-career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent questions to his impressive open training day late last year .
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula , and it looks like a wise decision .
Some trainers would have renounced Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a joke as much as the Excess Rugby-Liga convert did at its first Punt-Return on the Tuesota was defeating Minnesota .
But Tomsula trusted his husband , giving Hayne the next chance to a Punt-Return , as well as to the ongoing game following a breach of Bush .
Tomsula continued to demonstrate his true face in the diversion cabinet after the game .
Instead of mastering his roots to the rest of the team through the millennia , he encouraged them .
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne at his press conference after the game .
The 49ger sports counselor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist coordinator Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget his patented fang and take care of the next game .
Jarryd Hayne patents at a junk restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game .
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian acolytes had hoped for his NFL-Debut .
Hayne left the game floating , later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy of 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not make a worse start in his NFL-career .
" This was a thing that now occurs , look at the next game , and " Hayne said .
Hayne compared the cut to his Origin Debüt in 2007 , when a passport in his own God led to a spiral for Queensland .
Overall , however , it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds .
Hayne positioned himself as a photo with fans , keeping a Australian flag after the game , praising it on his day ’ s opera .
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gays rights .
Mikhail Khodorkovsky , Russia ’ s richest man , was arrested on a Siberian roles field with gun .
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , Khodorkovsky was convicted , seized Yukos oil company , and disrupted his democratic efforts .
Because of the large refugee numbers , free voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria .
Hubert Aiwanger , the Chief Executive of the FWC , warned of a severe crisis in Bayerni 's schools at the start of the Great Caucus , when there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students : " We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , " Aiwanger said .
" Otherwise , we will get dislocations in the Bavarian education system . "
The Free Voters ’ land faction dates to Friday in the undershore municipalities .
In fact , there were very different main issues .
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voter Meeting as well .
" Of course , the issue of asylum will overload the clause , " said Aivwanger .
Aivana called for the establishment of UN safe zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during Yugoslavia 's wars of the 1990 's .
" This is not the case , we must do the causes , " said the Free Voter Chief .
Reason asylum-seekers want to postpone the Free Voters as soon as possible .
As a result , Aivans also demanded more staff in the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : " We also need at least 50 new asylum-seekers , " said Aiwanger .
The FWC leader criticized the fact that several states are not consistent : " We need uniform federal standards . "
" Bavarians shoot down ; others don ' t . "
" Because we must become more capable of acting . "
But national politics in large city should not fall below the table .
A year-long darling remains the order of the day : education policy .
New years of schooling , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle ( CSU ) has launched 47 high school pilots of " median plus , " which extends the gymnasial middle class from three to four years , and takes nine years to complete as a result .
But that doesn ’ t go far enough .
" The G9 issue must be accelerated , " said the head of the FWC .
We are calling for choice for all GymnAsia , who want it .
Free travel comes wherever it is wanted .

4 People die after police shoot rubber cronies at demonstrators in Nepal .
Four people , including a four-year boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
The violence broke out on Tuesday Day in the District of Rupandehi , about 175 miles west of the capital , Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , the head of district officials , said that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station , with some of them dropping stones and fires .
Mr Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot it into the air before resorting to rubber bullets .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets that are known to kill but that they can be used as a lesser alternative seem to produce such a high death rate .
The argument has been the last few weeks of violent protests in Nepal ’ s southern plains , where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
There have also been protests in the Western Nepal by Tharus ’ s ethnic group , which wants its own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have become violent conflicts since 10 .
In August , when the four main political parties signed an agreement to partition the country into provinces – an important step towards a new constitution , but a highly contentious issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
The work of a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April .
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
City construction Creates
The land at the Old Youth Center is to be rebuilt .
The city is preparing everything to market the 4000-square meter area .
What is planned is a mixture of trade , business , and housing – but no concrete offerings yet exist .
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a large portion of roughly 4,000 square meters of land in its direct neighborhood , Alte Post , to the Youth Center .
Preparations for this are underway .
It is planned to use the holdings for a mixture of trade , business , and housing .
Waiting for such offers , says the city .
What investor asks is not yet clear .
As a result , no treaties have been signed .
The city of Emden had bought part of the land on the Strait of RingRoad / Eck , already bought a few months ago , shutting down the buildings that followed .
Hieve : Details are on the table
The Small Sea vacation plans taken shape .
The investor proposed publicly plans for the project for the first time .
Many people are more concerned - they fear the sell-off of their leisure firewalls .
Monatelang had been negotiating , grinding , debating , and signing behind closed doors .
Now plans for a new vacation resettlement on the Small Sea are close to the table .
The Interessent , the median emperor of companies ' " Systems construction , " made plans public for the first time on the monday on the Council 's town Development Committee .
Initially , this point had been on the non-public side of the agenda .
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction , which accused investors and administration of secrecy , Ralf Behren went on the offensive from the System-building Administration : " We don ' t yet have any answer , " he told the Council ’ s members and more than 50 visitors .
But it is good to see all rumors now .
The € 10-12 million plan , which has been expensive for months , has been in discussion .
Hard reactions among maritime owners who had entered the meeting produced images and new details of the desired hotels .
Roberto Schulz , Maritime Bureau , and board member of the Anliever 's advocacy , Pro Hieve , complain : " This becomes a huge enlotz that surprises everyone else . "
Moreover , he and many other project-critic thinkers fear that the transport would rise sharply through the plant ’ s intended size : “ Since there are entire bus charges to make that happen , ” he says , school .
But what exactly happens on the good hectare of the former hosts ’ real space is still an open one .
There are no operators yet .
" First , we must have a coherent concept , " said Ralf Behrends .
Because it was still missing , the building plans are also variable .
Twentification at Gorilla ’ s Frankfurt Zoo

NHC predicts a 60-percentage-point chance for cyclone south of the Kaports Islands .
The US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide depth of printing on Tuesday , roughly 350 miles ( 560 kilometers ) south of the most southern Kaports Islands , which has a 60-percentage-point chance of becoming a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours .
Another well-defined low printing system , for example , in the middle between the Kapverdian Islands and the Small Small , has a 60-percentage-point potential to form a tropical storm in the next two days , added weather experts in Miami .
Google is launching a double-dividend campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees .
Google Inc ( GOGL ) announced a double-dividend campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have swept across European nations by wrapping up war-torn and impoverishing countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the fundraising call on its blog .
Instead of letting a manager announce , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled Kabul ’ s family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
" Our trip included many dark railroads and buses , including hunger , Durst , Calves , and Fear , " she wrote .
I was lucky .
But , as Europe ’ s refugee and migrant crisis has grown , many people like my family are desperately looking for help .
Donors go to four charitable organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , the International Rescue Committee , Save the Children , and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said that the first global donations collected , up to $ 5.5 million , will be doubled , to $ 11 million .
Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely owing to Syria ’ s four-year civil war , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many are also fleeing the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .

For easily overweight diabetics , weight loss can help .
The benefits of weight loss for slightly overweight people with two diabetes can take at least five years , according to a new study .
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with post-weight diabetes live longer than those receiving non-surgical treatments .
" The mortality data take a long time to show something , " said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert in the weight loss of surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery .
Post-loss operations , or Adipositas surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the ploy .
They reduce hunger and limit the physical capacity to absorb food .
Over the years , Adipositas have proven efficient in treating Type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in humans with a Body Massacre Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , some weight in size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and that people with a BMI are more than 30 than obese .
You can calculate your BMI : 1 . usa.gov / 1D0zqDv .
For the new study , the researchers from Taiwan ’ s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected since 2007 , comparing two types of Adipositas surgical surgery – magnetic hypass and plastics – to treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans that were slightly overweight .
The average BMI among those undergoing the operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study .
Meanwhile , the BMI remained roughly the same among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment at 29 .
Among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % disappeared , and 28 % partly , of diabetes .
By comparison , the medical treatment group dissolved entirely , with only about 1 % of diabetes , and only about 2 % .
Moreover , the results were generally better found in the " surgical " group on controls of blood pressure , Triglycerics , and " bad " LDL-Cholesterins . "
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hemoglobin A1c , which reflects the tissue levels over time .
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 % , the researchers write .
After the operation , the average hemoglobin in A1c fell from around 9 % to around 6 % .
But the medical treatment group remained stable at around 8 % .
But this better " glycat " control - reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the head researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the Bypass-Chirure Group had lost more weight relative to the host group ( 18.7 v. 14.2 kilometers ) , received larger reductions in BMI ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) , and Hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % v. ) , and received a more complete overlap of the diabetes ( 46.9 % ) .
While the new study shows no comparative advantage for surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of larger people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life , Blackstone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
The Swedish study showed roughly 29 % less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study showed no benefit for surgical patients ’ survival , Blackstone said that it was reassuring to those with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the proceedings .
" That is the critical point of this study , because it says that it is lower in this lower BMI group , " she said without increased risk of death or kidney disease .
Blackstone added that once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30 , people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously .
" I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously , " she said .
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that their bodies have tied up with obesity and diabetes , it is really difficult to reverse . "
Love History in the Shadow
It is an issue that is now more visible in Belleyist : a young woman , unpopular and insensitive in school , is recurring and reenamored in her youth after years .
As in the recent novel " We are not really " Luisa Binder . "
Beyond love history , the novel may be especially interesting for readers , who play in dull messages and surrounding locations .
The chief author has grown up in dull , enjoying that she could create a literary monument to her home .
" It is impossible that anyone can get to Europe " Dalai Lama " News .
Europe can not absorb all refugees , said the Dalai Lama , adding that the real solution to the Middle East refugee crisis was to be found .
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called on the end of violence in the home countries of the refugees .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech to open the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
He demanded that humanity ’ s interests be put in place in the circumstances , before the interests of individual nations , or even continents .
He also stressed that , while West European countries ’ response to the refugee crisis was admirable , it was not appropriate .
" It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , " he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria ’ s efforts to cope with the crisis , he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution .
" Giving up several thousand refugees is wonderful , but , in the meantime , you need to think about long-term solutions to a genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . "
Ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries .
We must reduce the use of force .
" The use of force never solved these problems , " he added .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence , and compromised George Bush ’ s actions after the terrorist attacks of September 11 th , and found that the violent US response resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events .
After September 11 th , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem is through non-violence .
" I know his motives were good , but he used force , and the unexpected consequences , " said the Dalai Lama .
Four times higher rates of hand-out infectious drugs by children over the past four years .
Poverty control centers in the US report an almost 400-percentage-point increase in the number of children under 12 years of swallowing heavily alcohol hands-infection resources , according to the Georgia Poison Center .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , Director of the Georgia Poison Center , children under 12 years of hand-control medicines rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014 .
" Children increasingly enter these products , " said Lopez CNN , unfortunately .
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants , while some do so to impress their friends or for a social media sample .
YouTube videos show how young people drink disinfectants only for cheap experience .
Youth people have supposedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol mouth water in order to get a harder drink .
Younger children can be lured by attractive fertilizers of disinfectants .
" One child doesn ' t think this is bad for it , " Lopez said .
Many of the more attractive ( mobile disinfectants ) are those that are broken down .
There are disinfectants with earthquake , wine , and uranium duft that appeal to children .
Trading infections contain between 45 % and 95 % alcohol somewhere .
Small children , in particular , have few syringe injectors can lead to alcohol poisoning .
" It is highly concentrated alcohol , " Dr. Stephen Thornton , a medical director of the poison nover center at the University of Kansas hospital , the Station Fox 4 in Kansa City .
So you wouldn ’ t let loose whisky stand around , but people leave these mobile disinfectants in the reach of children , and if children do so , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who recently received four syringe injectors from school after earthquakes of dumping hand-related infections , was brought to emergency relief .
Her blood concentration was 179 , twice the threshold of an adult who is legally bleak , said Dr. Chris Ritchey , a circuit-breaker who treated her in glass Medical Center outside Atlanta .
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
Doctors overnight , in a separate child hospital , monitored her on signs of Hirn-Trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had alienated her head , said Ritchey .
" This was terrifying , " said Ortoria Scott , NhaiYei 's mother , CNN .
It could have been fatal for my child .
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol products or disinfectant books , and to relocate hands-infections beyond their reach .
Beyond alcohol poisoning , some disinfectants have died .
In 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the flood of hands-off infections contained a toxic , undeclared ingredients .
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol , a lethal solution , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was listed as a drug .
In January , three students of New York ’ s fourth class were planning to poison their “ non ” teachers by issuing anti-backlash products around the classroom , ” a police report reported .
The teacher is highly allergic to hands-off infectious drugs and banished her from her room .
The police regarded the thwarted plan as “ drivers , ” refusing disciplinary measures to the school establishment .
The Villingen Slick
A 33-year-old driver was easily injured in a backsliding between North ring and Herder .
A 60-year-old truck driver in the driver ’ s season towards circular traffic developed areas , and came too late to realize that two predetermined vehicles had been stopped on circular transportation .
As a result , he swooped with his truck into an audience ’ s check , placing the vehicle on a prior Ford Fiesta .
Serious damage from the accidental vehicles resulted from about € 10 ,000 , the police share .
The 33-year-old car was no longer ready and required to be pulled down .

Getting Celtic Leadership to Five points
ADAM Rooney ’ s misery in the first half of the day gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie so that the Dons create a five-point gap between them and Celtic .
Griffiff ’ s Lost Talk
There are rumors about Celtic Glasgov ’ s dimony , spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths , who insisted that he and his team cameras are not under increased control , as they prepare to confront the Dutch tabloid leader .
I do not believe that we feel under pressure ; I think players are happy to rejoice .
The lack of front-page competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch Boers
Former Rangers-medieval player and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , because there is no titanic rivalry with the Rangers .
De Boer , now Ambassador to Ajax , said , " In Holland , they no longer boil down the Celtic Games , and why ? "
It is because the Rangers are not there .
People here are not talking about the Rangers ’ return .
They talk about the Old Firm .
They talk about both teams together , and that is what they want .
There is plenty of tension in the Old corporate games , and it is not just Scotland ’ s people who want to see them .
I will turn things around , declaring Deila .
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic is struggling , but Norwegian leader vowed to turn things around .
Following the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by the 10-man from Aberdeen , who is now clearly at the top of the table at five points .
" Celtic had bad times before , " he said , and we will come again . "
Now we want to get out there as soon as possible .
I know that it is very frustrating , and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .
We feel that way - but we need to go further .
We really need , really , the support of Celtic , because the players make them better .
To stand together now is so important .
Warburton ’ s Bond Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting that he was rushing some Yar-Transfers , Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new admissions , insisting that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox caders .
As Brentford 's ex-chairman said , " The Yar-transfer window is very different from the Summer window . "
The players who arrive in summer have that pre-sailor time to integrate what you saw with our own group in this season .
The team is really good .
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Michu , a Celtic target , with Return
SwanSea storms , discussing with Celtic during the transfer period , have suggested that he could withdraw if his Swans Treaty expires .
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome needle for two years , and failed to make the departure from Wales this summer .

Griffiths Calls Avoiding Tynecastle
The incorrect hibee was allocated after admitting that he had sat a song with offensive texts on the former Heart player Rudi Sacel .
The incident occurred in a curse in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014 .

Tannadice Supervisors Trust in Don ’ t Governance

I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us .
We will bring the young back to work , " said Donnelly .
McInnes was happy to " shake up against Hamilton . "

Why I witness execution in Oklahoma
Something later , except in a late legal intervention , I would watch a man die .
When it happens , and I hope it does not , I will sit in a spectator show in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary death camp when Richard Glossip is executed through poison injections .
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
The invitation was for the first time in January above his best friend , and , though I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day nears , I began to fear .
So why should I ?
I agreed , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about capital punishment .
There would be a unique perspective .
To be sure , journalists can see executions in the US , and , because they often have more applications than places , there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media centers from 12 to five .
Whoever is chosen will be watched dispassionately .
I can not .
I will sit next to Richard Glossips , a friend with whom I developed my own relationship with telephone calls and two and a half hours .
I like the clothes .
We often laugh a lot when we speak .
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to read a title and a slump to track what I see .
I must simply try to remember all the details .
One Oklahoma journalist accused me of giving up my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the history of the detainee how he wants and you get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that " it could have better formulated it , " but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things I said and written .
He does not say to me what I have to write , and I would not , even if he did .
I have said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write .
When he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bellware , a reporter at the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , ask the series of Podcasts that I have done .
I don ’ t want to go back to all the details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions after the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a facilitator of action .
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
From that perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary .
Men on fire police hunting , he persuaded to get out of the Canning River .
The canning father of the police remained dry when he persuaded the man of the Canning River .
An attempt by a man from Perth to wean the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swift water , removing only a few meters from a police officer who tried " to persuade him to return to the shore . "
The police force of Canning Vale was called on Tuesday to incite a housewife in Beckenham .
When they discovered the suspects , he tried to escape them to Canning River .
But it did not get that far .
" He was in water - and said , " I don ' t get out , comfort and hol , " said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not all too enthusiastic about making his uniform , so he called for a more reliable tactic - " A good policeman . "
" Sometimes people do some beautiful things to try to escape , " said Senior Sergeant Castledine .
The championship football player Ben Cousins provides an unforgiving example .
In 2006 , cousins captured his car to avoid alcohol control , and then tried to swim over Swan River .
His efforts were unsuccessful , but inspired , locals in their humorous planning of Ben Cousins-Biathlon .
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy out him and threatens to end the race .
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to place a spy in his stalls last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
He aimed at stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai ’ s Late Scratching for treatment , the last straw on the Wednesday .
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the sport , and that he would have found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive Kobalt testing test for Lidaris , which he can not explain .
He had held back 18 months on espionage charges , and did not want " to look like too high a mourning . "
" I had nothing to say , and I had long sat , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out , " Moody said .
They know that it went on .
Sometimes , one responds , and one must live with the consequences , and I must live with what I have said .
Today , I will go home and sleep night .
I want to avoid the head I have heard , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
When they start to think , I don ’ t , I shouldn ’ t be trainers anymore .
I must then consider what I do with my license .
Previously , Moody upheld the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had sought to spy its stalls .
" Eighteen months ago , terror Bailey , Dayle Brown , and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would name when I am asked , offering him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stalls , " Moody said to Racing.com .
They seem to believe that I am a cheating .
If so , they should surely grasp their noses , because they failed to grasp me when trying to grasp me .
Robert Roulston , who chairs the RVL , David Moodie , the sitting president of RVL and Bernard Saundry , the RVL ’ s current CEO , were aware and still are .
Should this make me believe that it will become personal ?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly , perhaps making non-trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
Is I Bad for the Industry ?
Is I so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps people think that I am .
Perhaps they need to take my license and injure me , and I have no doubt that what I say is what makes me think about now .
But I have arrived at the point where I don ’ t care , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The level of frustration of the trainer ’ s levels built up with the prolonged Kobalt investigation of Lidari , and the Late Scratching meant that he said he could “ throw his license above the table . ”
Moody , best known by preparing the unwounded Master Black Caviar , called the Rennago treatment rule " ridiculous " after a pack of mud or tone was levied on horses debtors , which violated the rules .
" It 's against the rules of the sports .
I must assume full responsibility , " he said .
" One of my staff mistakenly muzzled up mud .
Yesterday could have been that way .
So yesterday could have been yesterday ’ s .
But it was the same on Rennday .
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treating the packs on the Rennday , opening an investigation into the matter .
It is a joke .
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse .
" We all accept that we need rules , but we have gone too far , " Moody said .
Trapped by a Car
The police arrested a man after a clash with a cyclist and subsequent Cobram passage on weekend .
The cyclist was handed serious injuries to Royal Melbourne Hospital , a helicopter who was hit by a car on a Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway .
The police said that the driver went further without stopping the injured driver .
On Monday , a 50-year-old man from Nathalia joined the police in Shepparton .
He is likely to be charged with traffic flight and underutilization and other traffic offenses .
The cyclist , a 40-year-old man from Cobram , stays in the hospital , and is in stable condition .
Craig Bellamy , a trainer of Melbourney , is lashing back at rivals for claims of ring ring ring .
Melbourney Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players ’ tackling a " agent setting " of two Prime Minister League Fours .
Sydney Rooster ’ s trainer , Trent Robinson ’ s , said that the referees allowed the Storm players to fight " with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on the Friday Final .
Brisbane Broncos ’ trainer , Wayne Bennett , made a thinly veiled note to the Storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Satday , calling the Rugby League 's game a " model " and saying that the two Queensland " were not too good .
Bellamy defended the torch 's team 's climate and said that they were focused only on their " contact " when it comes to Tackling .
Bellamy added that the critique of two leading coaches at his team trusted him , because they worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
" This recurs time and again - I didn ' t hear Trent Robinson speak of Ringin when they defeated us 24 : 2 , " said Bellamy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that , all year after year , we have not changed our defensive system or technology . But , in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus , and that has made the turnaround for us .
Trent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a little shock for him .
It is already comical , as this year ’ s record continues to appear .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett ’ s idea of “ exciting soccer , ” reminding his mentor that Bennett ’ s St George Illawarra won the Premier League in 2010 with " boring " football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
He likened his game to our Friday Day Day , and how exciting was , ” said Bellamy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was criticized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of it .
But now he has a team that can play , and that we see as exciting , particularly his young players at their speed .
This is the game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all of his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like it .
I build trust because they say these things because they are somewhat concerned about playing against us .
Six weeks ago , they probably did not think of us when the Big Games were involved .
Bellamy also pointed out that the anger against Roots was higher than the Broncos game against cowboys .
The Broncos game was probably a good game , but what was the result ? 16-12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that a exciting game ?
Or are they blueprints , not points of tension ?
For me , it is the game plans .
When they mention us , it means that we will meet them at a stage .
The Storm Team free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Culronla Sharki ’ s on the next Saturday night in the AMI Park Park Park .
Serbia ’ s Drug Criminal Caution
A man who might be a lifelong sentence for his attempt to acquire 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Quecensland was released against a $ 200,000 caution .
Marko Macsimovic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month , after the federal police found 100 kilograms of the drug on Yacht Solay , who came through Vanuatu from South America to place in Coomera in August .
Macsimovic was observed how he met his indictments in the Yachthafe Square , and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse , where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
Despite a potentially life-long punishment for trying to possess a commercial lot of cocaine , the macro-movic lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount , and that a harmless one could have been in the café .
The Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned about the threat of refugees at Macsimovic .
He has clear relations with Serbia .
He often travels to Serbia , " he told the court on Wednesday .
In criminal terms , he lied to the police about his whereabouts .
Macsimovic ’ s mother and boosters had offered a $ 200,000 settlement together as collateral to achieve his release .
" After reading the two people ' iron statements , it is clear that the $ 200,000 security requirement is a real financial burden , " Judge Flanagan said .
But this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Macsimovic was released against bail , under conditions of abandoning Australian and Serbian passport , merging daily with the police , and adhering to a baseline of 18 : 00-06 : 00 .

Stevan Hogg used a telephone of girls to attract pedophile to share images .
One pedophilian used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stevan Hogg took the girl ’ s telephone when he ran out , he may enter an online knife service , receiving a series of indecent images of children sent by another user .
The girl subsequently awakened , discovering that the phone was missing and found in the hands of the sleeping tweet .
She saw it , found the confusing stories , and immediately alarmed her mother .
The police took care of the five images , analyzing computers found under the address and discovering " Web inquiry " that used terms for children seeking decent images .
Hogg then claimed to officials that he did , because it would " lead to Internet pedophile , " and then pretended to be a policeman to frighten them . "
The prosecutor , Eilidh Robertson , told the Dundee Sheriff Court : " He said that it was an addiction - that he was addicted to terrifying people .
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer , but said that it happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare pedophile .

Sheriff Alistair Carmiel postponed the verdict until October to obtain background reports of social work .
Hogg was handed bail in this case , but was kept in custody for hearings other incidents to come .
He was admitted to the sexual criminals even before the ruling date .
Sleeters Good to Small Borders with Germany
More and more refugees are resorted beyond the main controversy on the German-Austrian border .
Many smugglers , afraid of discovery and detention , made people more likely to switch to smaller border crossings .
On the Austrian side , a Speaker of the Federal Police said .
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the countryside circles of Passau and Rottal Inn since the Tuesday .
They were foot over bridges and dams to the German side .

Stuttgart : Expanding Trouble " Henry " in Southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Mittwood Day .
Because of a deep pocket over Western Europe , the German weather service ( DWD ) spilled into Stuttgart .
The strong depth is the extension of the trough " Henry , " which has been drawn in recent days by the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic .
Strong storms and wild storms are widely expected .
According to the DWD , soils of 60-90 miles are expected to occur early in the black forest , gastrobic altitude , and soil season .
So , on Friday , the sun can be looked again .
The mass goes : every two years , the IAA highs show their news .
In 2015 , the main movement has been in the Compact Wars , which currently sell particularly well .
Compact automobiles are particularly challenging today : roughly 28.1 % of new entrants accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the automobile Office ( KBA ) .
This is reflected in the IAA ( publishing days 17 to September 27 ) .
From all the futuristic conception vehicles to new upper - and luxury cars , many new compact models are emerging this year .
One of the biggest presumes for Germany ’ s highways is Opel Astra , who will be with traders in the fall .
" The astrone is an extremely important model for us , " said Opel Chairman Thomas Neumann on the mass .
He is at the heart of the brand .
For the volume model to be sold well , the new astra will not be much more expensive to do so .
Opel promises to enter beneath the largest competitor , VW Golf , who starts at € 650 .
Today ’ s astrone costs $ 116 .
The Astra has a new 1.4 live engine , with 74 kW / 100 PS .
Moreover , the vessels provide more diesel and gasoline engines , from 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 / 200 kW / PS , for the first time including three-cylin-gasolineers .
Unlike the major competitors of the VW Gulf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra initially exists only as a firefighter .
The second variant will follow the Commission ’ s spring , which is already on the IAA .
And what , along with the Astra on the IAA , is being driven to new commercial exchanges ?
Renault Mégane : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astrate competitor Mégane into the race .
On the scale , the Mégane must be viewed solely as a fireworks in a conventional and stressful version of the GT .
Trade comes at the beginning of next year , then as a combi .
Infiniti : A new segment is Q30 .
The Nissan offshoots want to find their position in the rapidly growing segment of the new model .
But accompanying infiniti and its shaken lines fit fully into the chain line .
The baseline model will get a gasoline engine , with at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Suzuki Baleno : Nine in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno , who celebrates his world spokesperson in Frankfurt .
The model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0-live bomb and a performance of 82 kW / 111 PS .
The maximum swing moment is 170 Newtonmeters ( Nm ) after manufacturing .
The Baleno sales start in Europe is in the spring of 2016 .
DS – Not entirely new , but again , the compact cloning emodell , Switzerland , is 4 , which can be seen on the IAA .
Outside , the designers of the noble Citrol-headed offshoot citrol-beat ceiling ceiled : here the refrigerator was rebranded and the changed shoppers were equipped with LED technology .
Inside space was , above all , modernized , reducing the number of needles by a touch screen , and for the first time integrating Apple ’ s cargo .
Along with the IAA , a series of revisions and new variants , such as the revised Mercedes A Class or the pandemic 308 GTI , are appealing to the IAA .
JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square meter cells are degrading .
The German Constitutional Court rightly gave an ex-detainee of the judiciary ’ s mandate , Tegel , who was subject to too small a month in a cell .
Because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners have a fundamental claim to financial compensation when they are subject to small cells .
The German Constitutional Court decided this in a decision issued on Wednesday .
Indeed , according to judges , even if they were locked into the narrower spaces for a few days ( Az 1 BVR 127 / 14 ) , they can hope for money .
As a result , an ex-detainee who was drafted to Karlshe succeeded : he was in a single cell with about five square kilometers of land in the June and November 2009 judiciary , when Berlin-tea was not separated .
After that , the man who , according to his lawyer , has been returning to a free foothold had been moved into a larger cell .
His prosecution lawsuit for unworthy prison terms against Berlin failed .
But the Constitutional magistrates lifted the ruling of Berlin ’ s assembly law and rejected the case for re-examination .
They see the human dignity of the man violated .
Kammergers now decide on the level of compensation
Although only a few days are detention days for legal reasons of the questionable period , this said , for compensation .
Otherwise , " there would be no concern for the legal protection of personality . "
The collection clause must now clarify the level of monetary compensation .
Constitutional judges have in the past often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
Thus , they appealed to a prisoner ’ s compensation only in April because he was naked into a cell .
A 2011 decision , according to human dignity , is also vindicated by a cell with no separate toilet .
Moreover , on Wednesday , Karlshe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
The plaintiffs at the time were in between 15 and 21 hours per day in an equal proportion to the case in the carlruher .
Berlin ’ s prisons have also grabbed the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel .
Hence , 23 hours of aggressiveness , even beatings , are said to have happened because of the tense situation .
According to the court prosecutor ’ s arrival , 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied for lack of talent ; 19 are to be removed in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy : “ We Create it ”
Immigration is a huge challenge - the German chancellor is determined to accept it .
What ’ s Wrong with Germany ?
Some 800 thousand asylum-seekers are forecast to come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated firmness in the face of the unusual challenge : " I say again and again : we can do it , and we do it . "
What goes on to Germany is the overview that follows .
According to different forecasts , between 350,000 ( the federal government ’ s estimate ) and 400,000 ( the Pestel Institute ’ s estimate ) homes are needed annually – and for the next five years .
That is nearly twice what has been built ( 250,000 homes ) .
In particular , a shortage of residential areas is dramatic : 60,000 to 80,000 rental homes are now collected on average , and refugees will be applying for them for the most affordable housing .
German Minister Barbara Hendrick ( SPD ) therefore wants to double production , from € 518 million today to € 1 billion .
Far too little , from the perspective of the Pestel Institute , is the case : 80-000,000 social housing would have to be created annually , and for that the federal government would have to invest a $ 6.4 billion per year support .
Scientists and Secretary of State are united in ensuring that there are also more tax advantages for residential investment .
According to estimates by the Institute for Labor and Employment Research , 55 % of displaced people in Germany can be employed in the long run .
But the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them to join , criticized Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
But it is crucial that they find work in Germany to integrate refugees .
Labor holds the key to social contacts , for which advertisements in the admission society , but also for the self-esteem of immigrants , says migration researchers Dietrich Thrhardt .
In Germany , according to Thrhardt , there has been a political shift , from the labor ban on refugees to recognize work .
While formerly banning asylum-seekers from working for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as was the residence requirement , which confined asylum-seekers to a living place .
In society , a majority -- including because of skilled workers -- have come to believe that refugees should be able to enter the labor market faster .
A major obstacle to labor-market access is the lack of Germany ’ s knowledge .
So far , there is no adequate offer of general and professional language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most often delivered through personal contacts .
Building networks is thus a royal route to labor integration .
The Berlin School Administration has found that few fleeing parents give their children to the kitas , an estimated 10-15 % , " for the displaced parents , it is important to keep the family together , " Ilyes says , spokesperson for young and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
Yet , in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita , the administration distributes handzetters in different languages .
Should the large number of refugees boost the need for education , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities – for example , by allowing more university education .
In countries , students without Germany ’ s knowledge of will be prepared for classroom teaching .
But they are not always fully educated teachers and teachers , but , like Berlin , teachers who have only a qualification in German terms as second .
There is no shortage of them , says the Berliners School Administration .
The German student plant estimates that about 20 % of the refugees in Germany want to study .
In principle , no federal country forbids asylum-seekers or patients - the only exception so far has been Berlin , an interior senator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but has now abandoned his position .
Student-seeking refugees could be facilitated by access to higher education .
For refugees with residence permits or approval can not get post-asylum-seekers benefits when they begin to study .
The latter , in principle , do not get a firewood act , because they do not fall under the circle of Africans .
Patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible , shortened from January 1 , 2016 , to 15 months .
But the funding gap also needs to be closed , Steffen Krach , Berlin ’ s Secretary of State for Science , and Germany ’ s student network are calling for Stemming .
Students should get firewood right now .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , for many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many .
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches , and continue to develop the existing state Church right to a new state religion-based relationship .
It would also be important to create an Islamic welfare federation that is professional about newcomers .
The right also includes duties .
Thus , Islam ’ s representatives must agree on clear appeals and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and provide it with some checks and balances .
This includes a willingness to act against religious fundamentalism .
On Donbas Day , the head of the Muslim Central Council , Aiman Mazyek , expressed concern that religious conflict could be drawn into Germany as well .
Those who wanted to broadcast such conflicts in Germany " immediately forfeited their right to occasionally " forgive " in Germany , he said in Bayrian broadcasting .
He proposed translating the Basic Law in Arabic .
Integration in the future will be much more a matter for all society than it is today .
In order to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism becomes more urgent .
To be sure , Germany has had an anti-discrimination place and a general equality law for almost a decade as a result of European decisions .
But it is very slow to learn , as the NSU murder show , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
So are the same opportunities for everyone : what migrant organizations and non-white interest groups have long demanded , and what obligates international agreements such as the anti-racial Convention on Germany , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens and citizens - for the sake of all .
In general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that it has previously expected , says medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
" We create the power and capacities , " he said .
But extra money must go into the system to do so .
To avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery calls for all assumptions to carry out health cards equal to registration .
Benefits could be expected later with the German countries .
And , in the long run , it would be highly doubtful to decompose so many people to the limited measure of performance envisaged by the asylum application law .
Otherwise , doctors can create language barriers above all .
So far , Berliners have shown health scientists Thea Borde to be worse educated about migrants than other patients are .
Not only in clinics , but in doctors ’ brackets , too , need to be covered up with doler costs .
But many refugees would be paid , even with more common medical facilities in the emergency populations .
And with another diagnostic view .
Among refugee children , for example , there are far more untreated disabilities , and the young are HIV-educated .
But German doctors would be clear about their training , says Montgomery .
" Parasite cases or tuberculosis are not so difficult to see . " And when it comes to the medical shortages , refugees may even be seeing relief in sight .
The Syrians would have a sophisticated education system , with several refugees even doctors .
But , in order to be allowed to do so , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications , and perhaps re-examine them again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill , according to estimates by the Bundespchotherapy camp ( BPtK ) : most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Most vulnerable , Dietrich Munz , President of the BPTK , explains .
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child traumatizes in Germany .
Those with post-traumatic stress suffer , among other things , from respiratory frenzy , skirmish , heart races , and death fears .
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disturbances , strong horror , and emotional thumb .
To prevent symptoms from chronic , early treatment was necessary , Munz declared .
So far , however , only 4 % of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy .
While mentally ill asylum-seekers can apply for psychotherapy , the processing tends to take several months .
Moreover , in most social services , physical workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
This often leads to misperceptions , says Munz .
Slumbers
With the new intimacy of " passion , " the Circus Process is reverting to the traditions of circuses .
The goal is to draw every age group into the span of fascinating acrobatics , animal resses , and one-time entertainment .
Now the Circus Promony is inviting the Manege on the mirror waves .
" Our passion is the circus . "
" I can not imagine myself without living my circuses family , " says Stephania Promise , Tibetan , and Juniorchefin .
" Passion " - that is the current motto of managerial licensing .
For more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the family of Progressive Chambers .
So the family ’ s gift to enthusiasm lies in blood .
" It is important for us to take people away from their daily stroke and to catch them into a completely different world for two hours , " says the 27-year-old junior phone .
" Manegencocktail with the World Stadt-Flair , " Director Reinhard Proliferation calls his concept .
Today , 50 cities in the 300-mile tour can see this boir .
The circus program is convincing with talented artists from around the world .
Easy at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , Russia ’ s Stoliv Clown Family draws the audience with jokes and charms .
The Castillo Brothers , too , understand their craft .
Cuban duo is eager to take in with the triumphs ’ heroes .
They identify with ease and agility - in these words .
Their humorous art at the Mast is to conquer women ’ s hearts in the storm .
Except for numerous salves , the Acrobatics of the Circus Procus is also fascinated with fingerticism and money kindness .
Fixing Up to a bullet ?
For He Yuan , there is no problem .
Planket human beings are fascinating and frightening .
Lang in China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics , like little others , and fascinated with their mobility .
In every sense , 60 workers from 12 nations offer diversity .
" The animals are part of our family , " emphasized Stephanies ’ mother , Brigitte Protest .
Disputes in circuses are all too often the subject of various animal-welfare organizations .
Stephanie also puts it in place : " If our animals are not doing well , we are not doing well . "
Some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every unit of maturity .
The " four artists , " as they are lovely called , are dismissed from the eye for every wish possible .
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal is uncomfortable , it will not want to maneuver .
So the first imperative is to ensure good animals .
Specifically , the family is proud of the proprietary family , in particular to her Zebroid Jumbo , a combination of a Shetland-Ponyhengst and a citizen .
The two animals have lived together eight years in a secret , and nothing has happened .
" Then , suddenly , our small jumbo existed , " Brigitte Protest tells .
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for manege , it is the unique masses of the Circus Proliferation .
So , for every visitor , there may be something here .
" One thing is certain , " says Stephanie Protest , " Whether five or 1 viewers , we always do our best , and are all in the heart . "
The Circus town of September 17 to 20 per day invites his ideas at 7-20 .
On Sunday , the program begins 11-16 p.m.
Donbas Day is family Day , for which prices are moderated at 17 p.m.
Moreover , daily animus waters are opened at 10-18 p.m.
Zimbabwe ’ s Robert Mugabe Speaks the Wrong Parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa ’ s oldest leader , fell from a podium to the meeting earlier this year .
He remained intact , but the video of the case quickly spread to the social media .
The parliament ’ s opening was also clouded by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe ’ s speech .
Last month , they had buried him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address to Parliament - the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
The Speaker of the Democratic Change Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned would disrupt Mr. Mugabe ’ s speech .
" The message comes from a number not reported , but she is entitled " Death , " he told journalists after Mugabe 's speech .
It warns the affected MPs that immunity in parliament ends , and that their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective once they leave parliament .
The chief advocate said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was " concerned " about the dangers facing politicians .
Up to 30,000 jobs will be eliminated by Hewlett-Packard
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company ’ s restructuring and dissaving efforts .
Later this year , the HP will split into two publicly traded societies , separating computer and printing operations from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service jobs .
The expected reduction in jobs will add more than $ 2.7 billion to a fourth quarter , said HP in a statement .
" These restructurings will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise , " said Meg Whitman , HP Chairman , and Chief Executive to guide unity after the separation .
" Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses supporting a transition to a new style of business , " Whitman said .
As a separate firm , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy our customers ’ changing needs around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in annual sales , and " will focus on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions to business , " says the company .
It divides a company created by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930 's to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto Garage was called " Silicon Valley 's birthplace . "
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
HP , the world ’ s second-largest PCO manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that narrow , focused companies perform better .
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teamers must face the game of Dynamo Zagreb ’ s injured jack Wilshers .
Less emphasized to Wilshers that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation is carried out according to plan , there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilders will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and , given its history , his participation in next summer ’ s European championship is certainly still uncertain .
The great disgrace of this current problem is that Wildder sharply ended the last season of separate needle injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the pre-season .
" This kind of injury does not threaten the career , " said less .
It is a bone not well healed .
This is not a major matter .
This was just an accident .
It wasn ’ t connected to its needles or to the injuries that it had before .
That may be true from a purely medical perspective , but , however less recognized , there is a risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
An unpleasant pattern is also emerging .
Prime Minister Injuries Ltd ’ s research has had 23 different illnesses since his demise six years ago .
He has also played 157 gigawatts in just 65 of Arsenal in the last five days .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs , in six of eight hours since 2007 / 08 , that have seen most injuries .
Less accepts the potential for a vicious circle , but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will continue over the last season .
" Sometimes , when you get back from an injury , you have a fragile period , a time when you must strengthen your body and win your fighting power , " said less .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope that his body is stabilizing , I am confident that he will , and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions-League season on Wednesday against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday , and less of them rotation occurs within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Less can also start with Kieran Gibb and Olivier Giroud , rather than with aftero Monreal and Theo Walcott .
" I try to balance it , " said less . "
Although Arsenal is clear faiths to move forward by group F , the Zagreb Macmiri Stadium is one of the most terrifying places in Europe .
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games , after the " invincible " campaign was launched last season .
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on the Tuesday , 3.2 by the judge scale .
This year , it was 10 th in Zagreb .
Less , Arsenal has drawn the lesson of the past season with the champions ’ League-capitulation against Monaco , and remains motivated by distant hope of leading merchants with his management to his first European triumph .
" This driver is immense , " said less .
It has never clung to Arsenal .
We were very close in 2006 , but I am long enough in business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .
Friendsest Fest : the Comedy Show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar accounts in Shows is obvious , especially in view of men ’ s need to open up , has now become even more desperate than ever before , as suicide dramas among young men show on a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20-45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common for men than women .
In an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM ) announced 2015 as the year of mankind to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressed symptoms found that when the suffering had a sufficient percentage of friends with " healthy moods , " its chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , one must have friends , so that friendship can work .
In an age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on substance , the immediacy of the answer is often more important than significant contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lively , and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinary values ; money , image , social status ; everything at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner yearning for personal development and friendship , which is much more profound to our mental health .
As a video inventor and billionaire inventor recently said , money can not really buy happiness .
The beauty at Friends was that this focus was turned on its head .
Every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shined through the interaction as a friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandler frequent embrace , matches in the football guards , and Ross 's desire for revenge - all of this came from the knowledge that men can take to whatever circumstance , even if they often hold back their feelings .
As a telephone care officer told me , “ My audience for the role of people who are depressed and at risk of suicides has really shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ”
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
The old turn " I 'm right " has an enormous effect , as does the sense that it is perceived as weakness when it comes to speaking openly about problems . "
Friends is one of the Shows that makes me sense when I try to provide longer-term coping mechanisms .
It clearly represents the small moments of male friendship .
As much as my objective outsider status over telephone may help people at a time of despair , long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
So , if you visited this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the crowds that celebrate the day , why not take your friends into a drink in Central Perk .
Or , better yet , if you see someone around him in start-ups alone , you will listen to him a smile and say Hallo .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends are sent to Comedy Central Fest from the start to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for Friendsday Fest .
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blair Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his meeting against Malmö .
Di Maria meets his debution at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move to Malmö .
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on track when Paris Saint Gerhard launched his Champions League Saison with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Princensorship Stadium on Tuesday .
Di Maria met less than four minutes after his Champion ’ s League of Debüts , the PSGC players launched the French champion , but afterwards they missed a series of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani reached a headscarf in the 61 minute .
With Real Madrid and Donetsk in the Group , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master as they seek not only quality for the K. OK rounds , but improvement on the road to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns .
But , while they got the points , it was not a caricature pile of Laurent Blanc ’ s team that squandered Ibrahimovic ’ s opportunity to switch off the door , later swept away in the game against his home square team and the congregations that his illustrate career began in 1999 .
" It is not easy to win back home or outside the Champions League , " said Blanc , " so it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause and relax our adversaries , even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the season . "
" This is a good sign .
We wanted to win , and we won , though I regret that we have not yet reached another goals or two . "
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury to a Paris team of three changes , one of which , on weekend , was able to keep a 2 : 2 undecided , in its own place , against Bordeaux in the First League , but was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
Argentina ’ s flights were described as the man who can take the next stage in Europe , when Manchester United took over last month , and it hinted why , when he joined Marco Verrattis ’ s pass behind Malm-defense before surpassing Johan Wiland into the network ’ s long corners .
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed .
Malmö , who beat Celtic in a playoff to achieve this stage , entered the field at Anpiff with nine national players , with five defense and two deep opponents in the middle .
But , except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic , who went far to Kevin Trappin ’ s pastoralists in the 34th minute , they offered little to attack .
Instead , PSG sometimes abandoned itself , with some missteps and bad qualifications , not least by Ibrahimovic , who was patrolled in the first half of five attempts alone , and then abandoned after Cavani launched it after the reset .
Nevertheless , he demonstrated much more skill when he brought his co-players into play , and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a hub sent by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the forest ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the Cavani Stunn brand , thanks to Cavani , Uruguayan ’ s sixth season after Ibrahimovic fired a leftist flank of Maxwell .
This ended all the thought that Malmö could return to play , and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before replacing players Ezequiel Lavezzi was eventually recognized as a goal .
The coach of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class above its team , and the Norwegian said , “ Our last champions League game was last December .
Since then , we have been playing only in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
The skills games are not enough . "
Hold before Paris !
It was a great game of them !

Xavi : Pep Guardiola prevented change to the FC Bavaria in 2008 .
Since summer 2015 , the world ’ s champion of Europe has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar .
The FC Bavaria was apparently on the verge of a few years ago the commitment of Spain ’ s superstar Xavi , then playing for the FC Barcelona .
Eight times Spanish champions , three times the colonel winner , Champions League winners , two times club-world champions , two times the champions of Europe , one time a world champion - Xavi 's cover list is staggering .
In the summer , the 35-year-old , after 24 years , left the FC Barcelona and changed to Qatar al-Sadd Slub .
But in an interview with Marca , Xavi now tells us that he was about to leave Barcelona before the EM in 2008 .
" I was told that Barça wanted to sell me . "
" Madrid won everything " he says .
And so did the FC Bavaria .
Xavi : " There was an offer by Bavaria . "
" Romanians wanted me . "
To remember : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bavarians .
Guardiola was why Xavi did not change
But the shift was not possible .
And the decisive man for doing so today is working for Germany ’ s record mayor : Pep Guardiola .
Xavi explains why , “ Barça has taken Guardiola under treaty and I played a great EM . ”
" Pep told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . "
" He got me to do so . "
Who knows how Bayerns ’ s 2008 / 2009 Game would have gone with Xavi .
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance of race , switched the Red Rouge ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) , and ultimately celebrated the Royal Triumph .
Matt Damon ’ s Battle
Matt Damon confronted the African-American film magazine Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes .
During a succession of Sunday Night HBOs Project Greenlight , the experienced actor Brown broke down as he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagonist in the project ’ s elected script .
" If we talk about diversity , then do you , " not obsess the show , " he assured .
Brown responded shocked , with bewildered disbelief , calling " Hoo ! Wow Oay , " when comments reinforced the actor 's comments from The Martian .
Damon and Brown joined producer Ben Affleck and the Farly-brothers to discuss the Show-Finalists .
" I want to urge people to think about who will be the director , " Brown said at first .
The only black person , and she is a needle to be beaten by her white object .
Dear White People 's producer championed the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for Directorate Rights at the movie ; he replied that their directors " could end up giving us something that we don ' t want . "
When the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon ’ s comments .
Twitter users Mr Pooni expressed anger at the clip by writing “ Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is , SWEISS that it does away . ”
The Tweet has earned more than 5,000 residuals and 4,000 likes since its publication .
Damon ’ s comments come at a time when accurate racial media representation is at the top of social debate .
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Lives Matter movement was nationwide , urging legislators and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against farmers .
In February , the singer Prince referred to the movement during the nominated heirs of the year at Grammy Awards .
" So , " he said ( the elderly still have their meaning ) .
Like books and black life , old people still have their meaning .

Isaac Caldiero , a profitable exporter and promoter , became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and to take home the Great Price of $ 1 million .
The competitive show that just completed its 7th season , had never seen a competitive participant who had completed every stage of his hindrance .
During the seasonfinals , two men , Caldiero , and Cameroon Geoff BThird succeeded until the final .
The final task was to keep the glaciers in 30 seconds on a 75 foot of long glaciers .
In time , Caldiero finished the job , making him the first athlete to complete the strict 4 of American Ninja Warrior .
Caldiero talked to E ! News after the hard-won victory , still under the shock of the $ 1 million profit of the Great Price .

He received fans from masses of signatories .
So he is a brave guy and a family father .
He is a hero to his children and his wife .

Detroit Tigers Look Over Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half of the season was not particularly encouraging for the Detroit Tigers .
Once one of the best teams in Baseball , the Tigers are at last place in the American Central League .
The Tigers have been reduced to their role as Spoiler , but it has been perfect against the Minnesota Twins , with 5-4 in Target Field , at the Tuesday .
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a Houston Astros match for the second American League of Wildcard Square .

It was the first three-heat game for navy ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
" He has swallowed the slaughter , " said Ausmus .
He looked good at ( heading ) Bulgaria , looked far better , and got into the game directly .
With three rounds in mind at the end of the seventh inaction , Twins had their best chance of getting back into play .
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inside with a double standard on the left .
Right Fielder Aaron Hick achieved a walk , and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the trickery before replacing him with the left countries Blaine Hardy .
Hardy outnumbered the wall , the only man he faced , before the designated Rooky Camp # 45 ; Miguel Sano , who sacked the ICC leader , Drew Verhigen .

The ICC , however , suspended Sano at three Pitches for his fifth season .
Detroit benefited from an unmoving Phil Hughes game .
The Tigers arrived at three races in the first two instances against the ICC veteran , which had been removed from the violence-list game after having been missing more than a month for a feedback .
" Obviously not the start I wanted , " Hughes said , " but I felt more comfortable when I got rid of and felt that I would create some rather good plea in third inning . "
Having received the Leadaffi batter in the first place , Hushes gave up a single figure to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler .
A Two-Out Walk for J. D. Martinez brought into play Victor Martinez , who created a single " to the middle " at the first round of the game .
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 chances of success with the smokers in the Scoring position .
The third , Baseman Nick Castellanos , followed with a single right , created another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , ending the threat .
The Tigers made an One-Out Double of Catcher James McCain and a Two-Out Single of Center-Fielder Anthony Gose at 3-0 .
" This was a big blow , " said Twins-manager Paul Molitor .
He did not do very well , but he caught the right place .
Hughes was in a Pitchen council , failed to reach points in the third , before being replaced by the rebel director A. J. Aghter .
Hughes had three rounds at six Hits and one forest with four stickouts .

Germany , too , has not sent refugees back to Austria .

She did not name concrete figures and referred to talks on Mittwski in Berlin .
In recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary .
Their goal is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague , Werner Faymann , joined several other EU leaders in calling for a special summit next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis .
EU interior ministers want to take a new effort at a special meeting on the coming Tuesday ( September 22 ) to distribute another 120,000 refugees .
Given Germany ’ s strong refugee presence , the federal government wants more support in borrowing and distributing people .
The gog , together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday Day after nearly four hours of deliberation with the prime minister in Berlin .

Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkans Route .

The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
There were first arrests of people who had been fence .
Meanwhile , in Turkey , eyewitnesses reports suggest that thousands of other migrants were heading toward the Greek border .
Spacecraft " Cassini " finds oceans on Saturmond Enceladus
Under Saturmond Enceladus ’ s eggs , a global ocean surged .
This excludes researchers from observations of the predators " cassini . "
So the moon is easily switching around the rabble-plan .
The merchandise movement , though small , is nonetheless too big for an energetic heycopter , says a member of the Cornell-University in Ithaca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
Researchers present their analyses in the " Icarus " journal .
Later , it was known that under the Enceladus ice ceiling , there must be liquid water .
For example , “ cassini ” had already discovered an iron vulture on the south of the Saturmond ’ s south in 2006 , feeding the water vessel and eggs , the satellite ’ s so-called e-ring .
At least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronomers closed back then .
But the expansion of the hidden ocean was not settled .
Rama ’ s 1860 Munich lacks Several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up roughly one month or so at the offensive value of Rama .
An inquiry indicated an Adductor injury at the 27-year-old , the club shared .

No Dice Fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and safely sweet .
But those who want to pay attention to his slim line are often more likely to fade away from them .
For Mangos contain relatively much sugar – especially chimpy .
But the exotic fruit is healthy : they have B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. But , above all , Mangos contains a lot vitamin A and its precursor of concrete carotene .
Those who eat the fruit thus back segment , immune systems , and metabolic processes in the body .
Mangos should not be too soft or too firm to buy and pleasant .
The color alone does not say how ripe the fruit is , so green mangos can taste very well .
They should be smoothed at a meter temperature and consumed within days .
They then , of course , taste pure or sweet sticks .
One Mango , however , also gives special note to wary courts .
It mitigates the slightly bitter taste of some late-night alumni like Chicoree and Radico .
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish , poultry , and wild .

First , it ’ s Market Cold Front
Next night , the valleys of the elderly side of the rise are breaking through the way meteosilence topped the Tuesday .
On Wednesday , and on the night of Douchner ’ s Day , the heights are partially blowing up by the elderly .
After heavier on Donbas Days , we are crossing a markedly cold front that brings powerful rainfall , wind , and temperature declines .
As MeteoNews writes in a split , Switzerland is now on the verge of a large deep pocket over the British islands in a vigorous southwest .
On the world ’ s old-age page , it breaks down at the night to the highest level .
As a result , the level up to Donors tomorrow is in the soils of 60-100 kilometers ( 60-100 kilometers ) , combined , and specifically in the urban-land with more than 100 kilometers / h .
High levels can penetrate into adjacent Mittelland , and even mountains are more than 120 kilometers / h possible .
Whereas stormy warmth in the North is causing summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees on Wednesday , firepower on the Alpenhole is beginning to dust .
Here are speeches that persist until Donor Day .
In sum , in the next 48 hours , south of the alpen must be expected to be more than 100 liters per square mile , which has fallen sharply in recent days .
On the Donors Day , the sky is running out of steam , with a cold front roiling over Switzerland with strong , partially implemented speeches from West to East .
Together with the cold front , the wind frees up sharply to storm , and temperatures decline sharply .
The following days are about 15-20 degrees in the north , but the South is becoming less weekend and warmer , to up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther-Square
Knapp 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin-Luther-Square Square .
In the presence of city President Ignazio Marino , a nameless place in the park on the opio hill was on the name of the German reformer on Wednesday .
The " Piazza Martin Lutero " now pays him credit as a " German theologian of Reformation . "
The park is next to the Colosum in the middle of the old Rome .
The name environment had been requested by the evangelical churches ’ working community in Rome .
Jens-Martin Kruse , the arsonist of the Evangelian-Luthic Community in Rome , reminded Mittwoch that for centuries Protestants in the town of the pages could often live only in secret faith .
Square becomes symbolic that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 1483-1546 ) stayed in Rome for a few months as a young Augustine monkey to the annual turnaround of 1510 / 11 .
He felt that the city was a wooden scapegoat .
His negative impression may have reinforced him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther has then begun to fragment the Renewal Church with his anti-competitive credentials .
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus is ( gold-golden ) the village krone , one of the main works that Otmar Alt has in common for his bible .
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction , updating the context .
First , was the word ?
No , not for the Otmar-Alt-Bible , which now appears with magnificent images .
At the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt , who has articulated 150 motives his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and lunch .
His " language " of colorful color and imaginative forms has received 75-year-olds , but it is by no means synonymous with " capricious " images .
On the contrary , adapting the issues may well be bleak .
Around three years , Otmar Alt has worked on his Bibeli project , for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many themes of the " Book of All Boys . "
Cycles have emerged that address issues such as cruise , passports , avenues , or fatherland .
He spontaneously fascinated several partners : that is true of the Luther-Versus , with its theological orientation , as well as of the Cettler Deception , which focuses on art books .
And there is , above all , the author Klaus Altepost , who has grappled with each other on the basis of malaria .
He has interpreted the biblical selected by Otmar Alt , " translating it into " current contexts . "
These texts are like verbal mirror of old Malthus .
They are embedded between Martin Luther ’ s original biscene and each artist ’ s phrase , which formulates his very personal thoughts .
The smuggling band has golden limbs .
For example , the 75-year-old population allows him to look at his soul , his emotions .
This is a high degree of intimacy .
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bibeli project : Otmar Alt , born in 1940 , and raised in Berlin , came from a family that belonged to the rigid Protestant ruling Order .
" Otmar Alt remembers . "
" I have tried to work that way , perhaps again , to behave with the master . "
The second concern is to re-emphasize the art in a fast-moving way : " The perception of the world of images is now a recipe , and one that is loud .
Symbolic is displaced .
Artists have another appetite and window to show things .
Images always have some secrecy , not decorresponding .
" Here I am a dinosaurs . "
Otmar Alt wants viewers to " fall into the images , " to be found , and to feel what force they have : " The image is his counterpart . "
Klaus Altepost was on Tuesday in presenting the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation to be " always a lover of Otmar Alt 's art , " I may understand how he lives with images . "
It was not altogether important , even mysterious , issues that he chose .
" This was not an equal cooperation , " says Altepost : " This is the pictures of the text , " and it is an accounting bible .
For Hans ’ s air singer , this work is an invitation to " deepen his life and find freedom . "
Otmar Alt ’ s images speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
Part of the original , paper , and field images are first presented in an exhibition opened in the Otmar-Alt Foundation on November 15 .
Beginning BMR Road
Plans have made room , companies charged , modeled grabs for a rally : a year later , almost everything was finished – but before the official BMR railroad was opened .
Failures in politics and administration , especially among residents , failed to tolerate the channels .
So hill , searching for new space - now formally planned and approved by construction .
Allowing it to take place in October , the first community member , Sabine Mosebach-Bock , could now join the Children ’ s and Young Committee .
" I hope that we can still see this year , " she said .
It should then be launched without " another memorial break " with work at the former Hallenbad .
DFB Increases Refugee
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the federal league provides a clear sign on weekend .
Football responds to the incipient German situation , and it assures policymakers to help manage the problems ahead .
" I think this is our country 's greatest challenge since reunification . "
" In principle , no one can say that this does not matter ; I have nothing to do with it . "
" This must concern everyone , " said DFB Chairman Wolfgang Nierbach .
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
" I am the next Wednesday in the German chancellor of state , Mrs. Ezouz and the Chancellor . "
" Because the issue will certainly play a central role , " he announced .
Football can and wants to help .
But the decisive way must be by policymakers .
The German football ball ball thus expanded its “ 1 : 0 for a will ” by four years .
" Through the Egidius Brain Foundation , we have made certain that the program will continue by 2019 , " declared Nierbach on the fringes of the St. Julian / Malta meeting at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian .
Some federal authorities also support this program .
Already this weekend , the 36 profit clubs make a clear sign when they are wearing a high profile on the left rather than the usual sponsorship logos ( Hermes ) .
" We also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , " said Lesusz 's sports leader Rudi birller of the " image " ( Tuesday ) newspaper , calling it " self-understandable . "
" The refugee drama goes to everyone , no one can see away . "
" We can not , no , use our glory , influence , and capabilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , " said Hertha manager Michael Preetz .
Hundheim 's managing director , Peter Retsch , referred to a " prominent sign of the league . "
On this Friday , the women ’ s national team invites 100 refugees to Hall / Saale for qualification against Hungary .
Nanny called support for refugees " a great community of German soccer . "
That all 36 licenses in their places had started their own projects is great .
Equally great , small and small clubs are active .
The message " 1 : 0 for a will " that we have spent is soccer .
" This is of enormous importance , " he said .
This year and next year , the association with the DFB selection and the German government each provides € 300 billion to integrate refugees .
" The clubs have already cited the full amount in 2015 , " reported kidney beach .
Reports : SAP Chief Executive in Accidents
The chief executive of Europe ’ s largest software corporation , Bill McDermott , reportedly lost the left eye by overthrowing in early July .
In the accident at his brother 's US house , he fell to a water glass he bore on the left after midnight , reporting the " economic week " on his Wednesday .
" He was almost hidden , " he quickly took to the streets , saying last week , " quoted the " Vienna " where Hasso Plattner co-foundered .
McDermott , however , can do his job .

Football : BVB without Reus against Krasnodar
At Borussia Dortmund , all hope of a Marco Reus comeback in the European League ’ s first group match has finally disintegrated .
The national player will also lack the tobacco leader of the German football league on the DFK Krasnodar Day ( 19.00 Peter / Sky ) .
" We can not use him , " Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday .
Whether Reus will be there on Sunday in the Bundesliga-Topus match against libel , the BVB coach revealed , " We expect him to return to free-trade activities on Friday . "
Given his professionals ’ heavy exposure , Tuchel will not just change his stem post .
So he announced a change in the horror position .
That is why Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of tribal keepers Roman Buki .
" He trained at an absolute level , " the football teacher praised the world champion .
But , whether wheat fans were used in all European players in the future left Tuchel open .
He will most likely deny the second game .
As Miter Reus 's forceful testimony that the final entry for the BVB in the European League should be the goal , medium field player Julian Weigl believes , " It is not so wrong with Marco . "
" I think we have a good chance to strike the title . "
Robotercar ’ s Leadership for Germany
Germany is supposed to be the federal government ’ s will to change the car of technological leaders .
The German government ’ s ministers , including investments in expanding digital infrastructure , decided on Wednesday to issue a policy paper issued by Secretary of Transportation Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) .
On Wednesday in Frankfurt , on the fringes of the IAA automobile , Dobrindt spoke of a " new Mobility-Age . "
Automated and connected driving would increase traffic safety and reduce traffic traffic safety , said Dobrindt .
He wants to address the issue even with his G7 counterparts , who come together with representatives of the IAA .
The Department of Transportation ’ s strategic paper emphasizes , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband construction and a rapid shift to digital courses .
A test drive on the highway 9 in Bavaria is being developed to test new technologies .
The German government wants to review " the legal framework , " and to adjust , where necessary , to new developments . "
Germany , for example , wants to push internationally for the permissible maximum speed of self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers .
The German government also wants to push for a change in the Vienna Accords , which are so far the only driver of people .
As automated drivers drive , the car increasingly takes over , the driver becomes a passenger more and more .
Technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras who capture the environment and process the data in secondary settings .
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , high-automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Nevertheless , driverless public-road vehicles are " expected only after 2020 . "
The value added in bicyclist systems and highly automated location vehicles , Germany , estimates that the study ’ s authors will reach around € 8.4 billion in 2025 .
" Digital interconnectedness of the Pkew can lead to greater security and efficiency in street traffic , " said the SPD ’ s politician , Sören Bartol .
But the question of liability for accidents and the safety of drivers ’ personal data must be clear .
But Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or American cars .
As a survey by the Forsaari Institute on Wednesday for the Test Organization of Dekra shows , only eight % of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next decade , 32 % do not expect 31 % to believe in it at all in 20 years .
In France , 21 % of respondents are counting on autonomous driving cars by 2025 , 33 % in the US .
German drivers are often unwilling to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle .
According to an increase in the digital federation of Bitkom , only seven % would agree to transfer control across the street .
On the highway , the headline traffic could at least be 15 % , 45 % in traffic .
For every fourth , the car would not be left to control under any circumstances .
Boll says Team and Double Start at Tischnis-EM
The villain , now on its cover of the 25-4 front-page struggles , is only in a bind .
The final decision is to fall on September 22 th .
" This is a huge loss for our team . "

" We are strong enough even without titling Timo , " said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßf during the EMU curriculum in Dsseldorf .
Boll was then on the run to become a long-agreed sponsorship in China .
The 34 years old German champion is expected to return on Friday .

The hamelner who leads the slaughter in Yekaterinburg , but also reminded the EM in 2013 .
" Back then , Timo was also lacking , and we have become champions of Europe . "
" This is what we should look to , " the world-class Fifth .
Manchester United , the English national football player Luke Shaw , has drawn a heavy injury on the right .

Gauller feels too old for an Enfant to Be
It is a mixture of quite large fashion shows and a mother-grandson : the designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) issued an exhibition on Munich ’ s Wednesday .
The bottom-up tips , which , thanks to video projections , seem terribly human .
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became a great star of Modeszene 's chickens with Madonna 's refrigerator , and thus of keeping men in ruins .
" I can no longer say today that I am the grandfather of the skin clause because I have soft hair . "
" In the old days , it was not easy , now it 's real , " said Gauller .
To visit the exhibition " From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk " ( from the Citizen to the Staff ) , which was seen on September 18 at the Kunthall of the hypothesis Culture Foundation , it is lucky that the fashion creator has altered its initially anti-human stance .
In fact , he had opposed it , because , “ for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , ” he said .
When you die , you get into the museum .
The impressive collection had already been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris .
" It 's about as much more than just beautiful clothes , " the director of the Kunthal , Roger Dieder , said .
It is about tolerance , acceptance , and a vision of an open society .
The exhibits provide a glimpse into the thinly overlooked work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completing an education .
Chronologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent choreography of the entire enterprise for which much effort has been done : a stylist , for example , has been involved to fix the puppets .
14 tons of material , according to the Kurator Thierry-Mamaximum Loriot , mapped power to Munich .
Just before October 's launch , it was a special smancher : a lederhosenger outfit with corset .
Heimeets Madonna .
He has always wanted strong women ( “ women are cleaner than men ” ) , and said Gauller for people who are a bit different .
There is also the exhibition of Gaullist ’ s old Teddy .
He represents the designer ’ s first , timid fashion hacking .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy BHs and clothes , Gauller said .
Playing with a puzzle would not have allowed his parents to play with him .
He later taught himself the design of fashion .
He staged fashion journals and looked at other designers ’ drafts , as Gauller told in Munich .
Later , of course , I bought it .
For his first movie look , he could not pay the models .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to stay .
Smuck , not Gardine - Plucky Leaders as Mode-Niche
In the past , long nitrogen engines were about to make meters .
The specified materials and hospitals were created in large numbers for customers who , for example , continued to process them for cards and garden engines .
That alone no longer works , Andreas Reinhart , the Modespitz Plus CEO .
Instead , fashion is once again important .
Mode played a larger role in the parrot 's early days , then displaced by the textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche .
Reinhart offers some examples : the top of smuggling , accessoires like pockets , and regional traits .
Overseas , the so-called vinta fashion , which has been opposed to past styles , is an increasing potential for contract .
Those in Germany who do not consume niches are no longer market .
We already make up half of all contracts .
Modespitz Plus , along with nine other companies , is a member of the industry ’ s association of Plauenians .
Only they must bear the burden of being protected .
Roughly 80 % of sales have broken out over the last 15 years .
Private expertise , as well as wholesale trade , has almost disappeared .
Our products still barely reach customers on this path .
Mass supplies are now produced much cheaper in Asia , and are displaced almost exclusively through chains .
Moreover , exports , currently to Russia and the US , are weakening .
So there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
The industry ’ s confederation also seeks to showcase , as Cordula Bauler of the Falkenstein Staff explains , “ Since this year , we have conducted a quality seal that shows we produce environmentally and socially tolerable . ”
Additionally , " This refers to the materials used . "
Diplomacy designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snow Executive Schneeberg of the West 's higher school of Testeau - the fact of art applied - and is specialized on sticks and spies .
To counter Asian competition , we need to find high-quality and innovative products .
That will take time and courage .
There is a tension between the designer 's sinister ideas and the operations , " says Schmidt .
That is why existing design is often easily varied in order to maintain a customer .
A few years ago , textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic Ponzi balloon .
Yet , in some places , the machine stifles small cows .
Bianca Hallebachi , the plenary gold demaster , was inspired by this : " Before I could do nothing with traditional platitudes at the top . "
Now it is using the Ponzi balloon for its smuggling .
In an appalling procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
" Many people in the region identify with Plens ’ top and old , " said Reuter .
It also supplies to the US , after Australia , and Finland – especially customers whose ancestors have lived in blue and environment , and who want to remember .
So I see this as a modern Ambassador to the Plauenians at the helm .
Disney plans New " Mary Pollins "
Let ’ s not celebrate , but Disney nonetheless dares to create a new film by his classic “ Mary Poppin . ”
" Entertainment Weekly , " however , is not about a revision , but about a kind of sequence that 20 years after the first film with the magic nannies .
The question is the experience of the nanny family with the Bank in England during the Great Depression .
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear .
But the director is already clear : whether Marshall , most recently , was " Into the Woods " in Kino .
Xi is pressing to Broaden the World ’ s Economy
The economy must more broadly open up to support growth , President Xi Jinping said on the Tuesday of a group tasked with guiding reform .
" China should advocate attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-ups , " he said in a speech at the 16th headquarters meeting of the Central Leaders Group to deepen comprehensive reform .
To promote start-ups and reform will create new momentum and vitality , giving new ground to economic growth , Xi said .
The Leading Group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border-control policies , promotion of SOE state-owned enterprises ( SOE ) to raise private capital , and overhaul the resident melting system .
According to the statute , a negative list is developed that identifies sectors and companies that are not in question for investment .
The system is gradually being tested and improved through testing programs .
The initiative is important , because it assigns a larger role to the market in allocating resources , ensures a legal business environment , and makes the market more open , the Statement said .
The government will also loosen controls on the powers transferred to companies , ensuring that companies decide how to run their business .
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors , more areas are opened for private investment .
" The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , " said the Statement , " protecting the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and providing better services to them . "
Moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply permanent residency permits or the “ Green Card ” by optimizing requirements and facilitating the process of application .
The lawyers ’ right to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosecutors , was also discussed at a meeting .
At the meeting , Prime Minister Li Keqiang and major leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended a declaration issued after the meeting .
The EU wants to double mercury in spacecraft fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits on mercury in large spacecraft fish , thereby encouraging consumers to become a much higher dose of nerve poisoning .
The Consumer Foodwatch Organization , which includes an analogous EU working paper , sharply criticized plans : " Risks and side-effects of failed industrial and environmental policies will be passed on with full force to pregnant pregnant and small children , " Matthia 's Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch .
According to Wolfmidt , the limits of nervous poisonous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai or Food Facility , are set to be raised from a two-millimeter mercury per kilogram .
Major spacecraft , however , is already so heavily burdened by mercury that around 50 % of the size of the border remains unsold .
As border levels are doubled , only 14.5 % would be unavailable .
In exchange for this relaxation , the EU , according to Foodwatch , wants to tighten the threshold in other fish from 0.5 milligrams today to 0.1 million meters of mercury per kilogram .
But Foodwatch called this a " trick , " because smaller cables , such as maps , are usually so low that they are already meeting the projected maximum levels .
Lowering small fish is thus " a perfidu distraction box , " Wolfmidt explained .
mercury is a highly toxic metal of gravity for humans , which extends heavily across the food chain , especially in spacecraft fish .
The German government therefore warns that " already-small quantities , especially in unborn insults to the nervous system , " can cause already small quantities .
The Federal Environment Ministry says at its homage in terms of maximum health threats to the general population , " but that it does not expect a " health threat . "
Mercury is concentrated in burning coal .
Germany ’ s coal plants , according to a written departure from the Federal Department of State , are reporting to the Green Bundestag MP Annalena Baerbock , more than six tons of mercury every year , two-thirds of the total in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish in , say , Elbe , Rhein , and Donau was " permanently and covered " had cited the " mirror " from paper in March .
Last year , Europe ’ s warnings about mercury in fish have been among the most common health risks in the EU ’ s warning system , RASFF .
Foodwatch calls consumers for a protest against the EU ’ s plans : www.quecksilberg ’ s action .

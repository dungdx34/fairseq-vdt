Back to the very American Ideal of Labor Rights as Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil law .
" Just as unions die , so , too , do middle-class jobs , " Ellison said , a Democrat from Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress .
So I proudly put forward the Workers ’ Law , along with the Civil Rights Cone John Lewis .
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against the organization of trade unions as it does in other forms of discrimination , and it frees up anti-union forces .
The amendment of national labor laws to create a way for discriminatory workers to organize a union service to try justice in civil justice - and to receive compensation or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative .
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis , and other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link back to a very American idea .
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan , and other countries around the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize , extend , and respect labor rights .
There was a time when millions of Americans remember it called democracy , freedom of speech , press freedom , and the right to unite in a breath .
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged Japan to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced with democracy .
Aware that workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan , they used a language explicitly acknowledging that " workers ' rights to unify and to negotiate and act together . "
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was replaced by a strong democracy .
Recognizing that workers would have to organize and speak out in the new nation , the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly said : " The right to start associations in order to ensure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed for each individual and every profession or business .
Agreements limiting that right , or aiming to diminish it , are zero and unlawful ; targeted measures are illegal .
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the presidency of the International Human Rights Commission , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations in 1948 , Roosevelt and the other authors issued a guarantee that " everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests . "
For generations , Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
When that country debated other countries how to form civil and democratic societies , Americans said that the right to establish a union union – and to insist that the union should then be protected in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government .
With those rights under fire in America , it is indeed wise to re-examine the American ideal , which requires that working people have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society .
Fifty years ago , Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said :
History is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not constrain , but increased , the strength of , the nation .
By raising living standards for millions of people , labor miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of output .
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
History is reminiscent , and we should do so .
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and extending the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of labor representation - is long overdue .
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renovating the ideals that America has made in the past and that triggered the promise of democracy .
Judges are temporarily stopping the law that all abortive clinics in Louisiana could force abortion clinics to close .
A US federal judge stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday , which one of them said was likely to lead to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
This measure , which Bobby Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , was to be legislated in June 1 and enacted on September 1 , would force physicians who carried out abortions to obtain a patient entry at a hospital within 30 miles of hospital .
But the judge ’ s decision means that , for the time being , doctors can continue to be legally permitted to write down while demanding such a right .
" The plaintiffs can continue working as they seek these rights , " wrote federal judge John Gradevelles in his judgment .
Within a month , a hearing is set for the judge to make the law a more permanent decision .
Writers of abortion welcomed the recent decision in a series of judgments against similar measures , saying that doctors gained so much time to gain hospital rights .
“ Today ’ s decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a lazy law that they want to deprive them of their health and rights , ” Nancy Northup , President , and Chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights , which had indicted in the name of three of the state ’ s five clinics to stop the law .
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict was extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the suit and had also requested enforcement rights .
Louisiana is one of 11 states that enacted similar laws , and courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be unconstitutional .
Key branches of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the remaining clinics to close down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday .
Supporters of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists , as well as the American Medical Association , agree that doctors ’ discretionary rights demand unnecessary restrictions .
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures were intended to protect women ’ s health , though some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics .
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patients ’ rights to intervene , shared the center for reproductive rights .
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop aborting , the doctor , fearful of his security , would no longer conduct surgery , the group said .
In opposing the verdict , Louisiana State officials said that they would not punish doctors for conducting abortions , while their claims to patients would be penalized .
Delayed diagnoses and inadequate access to best treatments mean higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas .
Angelina Jolie and her brother , James , have online a video maker for her mother who died from ovarian cancer in 2007 .
For women in rural Australia , there is a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than for women in cities .
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1100 Australians , who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 , and found that only 25 % were alive five years after the diagnosis .
Susan ’ s research director , the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute , said that for those living in rural and remote regions , the risk of death during the study was 20 % higher than for those living in urban areas .
CALEINE STUDIE – New Drugs could slow LEvents and ovarian cancer .
Researchers studied health care for women for more than seven years .
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosing , the type of ovarian cancer , existing predisorders , and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival .
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed at the diagnostic point , the survival rate was lowest .
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of mortality during the study was 20 % higher than for those living in urban areas .
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suspects a belated diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments centers than possible factors .
“ The disease is best treated by gyneological oncologists , and these are mostly found in major cities , ” she said .
Despite improving the telemedical services to counter the distance , she proposed , as a possible remedies , an increase in the service of registered doctors to enable specialists to provide poetry to women living in their homes , as well as treatment programs for people outside their region .
Dr. Jordan said that , regardless of geographic status , the study showed poor long-term survival rates for women in ovarian cancer and underscored the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The study , funded by Rio Tinto de Riquer Cancer , is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2013 , Elisha Neave , a young mother of 33 , learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
Regret the Declining Household
The decline , together with an increase in the number of homeowners under 35 , could cause gardening centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year if today ’ s young consumers , according to a study by the HTA , reach , the “ Creation Group for Chief Products . ”
The report states that , on average , mix spending 55 % of the amount that people with homes spend on their own .
The rise in people living without gardens in highly urbanized areas , the popular process of aspiring forebears for parking , and the falling garden size are further factors that threaten the industry , estimated to be transferred at $ 5 billion annually .
In London , where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 % to 43 % for a period of 6 years , the lowest expenditure on gardential products per household is reported .
The HTA and Royal Horticultural Society suggest that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not harbor plants .
Guy Barter , Chief Adviser for RHS , said , " Container gardens , for example , are popular with rented cattle because they can pick their crops in a reversal . "
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the " golden era " of the horse-trading era , owing to rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 's to the mid-1990 's .
He also predicted improved market conditions this year , owing to better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April of last year .
Pakistan ’ s protest movement , led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri , continues .
In the capital , Islamabad , roughly 1,000 protesters have staged PTV ’ s state-owned television station .
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings .
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes , but is now sending back .
At the same time , some 3,000 protesters tried to get Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence .
Roughly a kilometer away from it , they fought rivers and stones armed with security forces .
The police used tear gas .
The protesters demanded Sharif ’ s resignation , but he rejects it .
Meanwhile , the country 's army has vowed to " waste without time and use without force " a political solution to the conflict .
After a meeting on Sunday 's headquarters , the military declared : " The army remains committed to ensuring the state 's security . "
The military has played an important role in Pakistan , and has already been more frequent .
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of being cheated in last May ’ s parliamentary election .
The protests were escalated on weekend , as Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to penetrate Sharif ’ s residence .
Three people had been killed .
Turkey Institutes the US Diplomat for Spying Report
Turkey ’ s foreign ministry has hired the country ’ s longest-serving US diplomats to announce a report on American and British espionage in Turkey .
Vice Secretary Bülent said that the US Embassy businessman and Turkish officials addressed the report on Monday .
Germany ’ s magazine The Spiegel , as well as online magazine The Intercept , reported that the former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a major area of engagement for the US and British intelligence services .
According to Turkish news agencies , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the significance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other .
An earlier report that included Germany ’ s main intelligence agency , Ankara , was targeting by far more angry than the Turkish government ’ s response .
Warning : Local Leaders Do Consequences
The local leader ’ s national warfare on Monday night may also affect people ’ s movement into NRC ’ s .
The state of emergency , announced for 18 to 21 , has been canceled nationally all traffic companies , including farms , regional , and S-rail traffic .
The main thugs of the wark are movement of goods .

Sven Schmitte , the leader of the German Locomotive Union ( GDL ) union , said in Düsself village .
We expect substantial defaults .
Regional focus has not been given .
The main thugs of the wark is movement of goods .
The German Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimize the impact .
But the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike , so it is hard to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
Corruption Police Chief
The prosecutors , on Friday , submitted evidence to the Mallorca prosecutor ’ s office of blackmail by police and public servant of the city of Calvià .
The head of Calvià ’ s police on the Mallorca fireworks was arrested after corruption charges from businessmen and barracks in the infamous Bind-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf .
The chief commissioner , José Antonio Navarro , has been put in custody by several businessmen from Punta Ballena , the street where most bars and nightclubs are from Magaluf .
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario , on the Friday , prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià .
Two other local policemen have been arrested by Spain ’ s Guardia Civil with corruption charges , and are consulted with Navarro by a judge .
The ABC , the national newspaper , reported that angry nightclubs said that the authorities ’ cronyism had a serious impact on their business .
" It is no longer about making money , it is about survival , " said one businessman to the court .
Let our livelihoods be put off the line .
We have nothing to lose .
Magaluf made international headlines this summer , owing to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist to 24 men during a Sentour Fellatio .
Since then , the authorities have tried to stop alcoholic vacation behavior in magnetic care by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic cattle cities .
The Playhouse club , where the Fellatio incident took place , was forced to close a year , while Playhouse and the Kneipentance organizer Carnage collectively face a € 55,000 ( $ 73,000 ) penalty .
The tourist town of Magaluf , popular mainly with young British holidays , is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence , including the trend of " Balconing , " in which humans leapfrog from one balcon to another , or from one balcon , balcon , to the hotel pool .
The first Spring Day , with Numerous and stormy weather conditions , impairs flights from the Adelaide Airport .
The FRUSLING has brought South Australia a winter surprise , with powerful actors and strong wind disrupting flights from the Airport of Adelaide .
On evening 21-21 , another 5 feet of rain fell to the city , after 6.6 feet that had already settled on Sunday the night .
The final rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy spectators , including a committee that began just 20 p.m. , producing almost 4 feet of precipitation .
After last week ’ s winter produced an early dose of spring , the city ’ s temperatures fell again on Monday to a peak of only 15.8 ° C .
Divided weather conditions have probably led to the belated landing of Virgin Airlines Flight from Melbourne to Adelaide .
The plane was to have landed shortly after 19.30 , but was hit by a wind – a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance – and had to start .
wind strikes reached about 50 kilometers / h at that point on the Airport of Adelaide .
The airline data showed that the plane had to go through a second runway , and eventually set it at around 20.40 .
Delaying the air subsequently led to the delaying of some other flights , including a Dubai Emizer Flight and a quantum flight from Sydney .
For Adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted at the Tuesday , with prospective actors .
Matthies says , Best Time for Great Blinders
Given the galvanizing technological progress that threatens to turn our easy home into high-tech centers , our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles with a highly familiar electronic audience .
As I write this , my look at the spiral that links the words to the telephone and I think : Boah , how retro is it ?
But there is a reasoning : if the cables were not , all words would quickly be rotten in the house , and that would be significantly more retro .
In any case , is the electronic ( ectronic ) ?
No , Tipply errors : the electronic sector is the rule that today 's global newness is tomorrow 's electronic bankruptcy - purchased .
And whoever , for example , still has a TV screen in the living room , says only that he fundamentally rejects television .
Why these considerations ?
Because Ifa ’ s urge to function this week reminds us of our absolute incompetence on electronics issues .
The lay that once blindly dominated washing machines and CD players now does not even understand the purpose of the devices used by unfathomably enviable speech of experts before him : " Connected Home , Wearables , Health Care , and Urban Technologies " promise us the press office .
Yes , is it ?
What should be said about people who seem to volunteer such quarters ?
Indeed , for about 20 years , the main point has been that we should be complacent on our house .
In order to prove yourt himself so that the firewall on the Maldives will tell us in the vacation that it is burning in the workroom .
And wouldn ’ t it be surprising if we arrived from the office on climate change anytime soon ?
Yes , however , this presupposes a climate change plant .
But a dream is soon realized : we , according to you , raise our watch , say , " sows ! " and at home , the dust boy feeds grossly .
It is a mistake .
Everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution : " The boundaries between white and brown commodities are becoming blurred , " an industry brown , one can link the washing machine with a headscarf hearing , the steam garners send the weather report , and the data brilliance reveals how long the pizza still needs in the blueprint , but because we are in the blue .
We also know from daily practice : when a new-fashioned device is sorely needed , the acku is guaranteed empty .
What another reason is that the phone spiral will survive the next editions .
Israeli Children Return to School after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they spent summer in airspace , while rockets and murderers fled their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war , and schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from fighting .
The start of schools brought a sense of joy and expectation to southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting are fresh .
In the southern city of Ashdod , workers of the " Pashosh " kindergarde , who were hit by one rocket , removed from the walls and shale admirers before the students arrived .
" We have a bit of fear , but are excited , " said Ronit Bart , a Kibbutz inhabitant , Saad , and English traveler there .
Many of our area ’ s children desperately need a return to routine .
Her 11-year-old daughter , Shani Bart , said that it feels " a little comical " to return to school suddenly .
“ These were difficult times , and we didn ’ t get out of the house at all , ” she said .
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support .
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week , thousands of border inhabitants like Saad left their homes or left their homes to move farther from Gaza to escape the rocket and murderous fire .
Many Middle al Oz residents , a community near the border with Gaza , where a four-year young were killed by a Palestinian murderer grant , are hesitant to return .
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned .
Their children have been taught for now in other schools .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot , a border city with Gaza that was severely marked by the Palestinian shootings .
He appealed to children " to learn much , " and said , " We will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and provides you with security . "
Israel and Hamas agreed on an open-ended ceasefire on last Tuesday .
The ceasefire ensured an immediate end to the fighting , but major issues remain unresolved , such as Hamas ’ s demand to remove the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the Gaza Air and Lake .
Israel calls for disarming Hamas and transferring the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin this month in Egypt .
In the war , more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed , three-quarters of civilians , and at least 494 children were estimated to have been killed by Palestinians and the UN .
Israel denies this , and estimates that at least half of the combatants are fighters , but produced no concrete evidence of the information .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and assassinations into Israeli cities during the fighting , most in the south of the country .
Meanwhile , the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
Israel ’ s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were rebuilt into temporary safe havens .
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in space and continue fighting , education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week .
" I hope the school will soon be reopened so that we can learn more , like the world 's children and Jewish children , " said Mohammad Amara , a 13-year-old boy living in a school in Gaza .
Electing in Sachsen : CDU Vice power is questioning NPD supply processes .
Given the NPD ’ s loss of votes in Sachsen , CDU-vize Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD supply-side procedure in federal constitutional court .
- According to the CDU Federal Republic ’ s Thomas Strobl , the ongoing supply-side procedure against the NPD should be put to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court .
" The NPD performs worse than last time , " said the power bl , who is also the leader of the Bavarian submarine at Baden-Württemberg , the " Bopty People 's newspaper . "
This is a pleasant development in the right direction , and a development that makes me more likely to conclude that the NPD is politically challenged than in the constitutional court .
The NPD barely failed in Sunday ’ s vote on the five-percentage-point vote .
A first push for a ban on the far right failed in 2003 , because constitutional protection was then also informanted at the NPD ’ s top .
In December 2013 , after a long preparation , the Federal Council filed a new motion in career calls .
Germany ’ s government and Bundestag did not follow suit .
Harburg : Ten for New Refugees
The place in the newcomer is now being put in tents .
The headline first incursion into refugees in Harburg is bursting from all counts .
Now the interior authority has let three tents of the Red Cross go by .
Short-noticed , districts are unenthusiastic .
" These skin actions continue to inflame citizens ' reservations , giving the local politicians no way to constructively participate in the human shelter of refugees , " says Britta ruler , the leader of Greens in the Harburger district assembly .
Harburg , the county administration , is calling for its party to provide unused houses to house .
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents .
The onslaught of aid users – and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough tracts in subsequent facilities – is the cause of overcrowding .
Many refugees remain longer than the regular three months .
Housing prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years , a widely observed index shows .
RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Home Home in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 % in August , RP data from Monday .
This increase is the total increase in June , July , and August at 4.2 % , the largest in winter monthly hikes since 2007 .
The annual price increase was 10.9 % , more than twice the rate of increase in the 12 months ending in August 2013 , but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country .
RP Data ’ s research director , Tim Lawless , said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a secondary market .
RP data show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1 % last year , but by 11.7 % in Melbourne .
Subsequent markets are Adelaide , Brisbane , and Darwin , where prices rose by an average of 5-6 % .
At the other end of the scale is Canberra , hit hard by cuts in government spending , where prices rose by only 1.4 % year on year .
Mr. Lawless continued to say that with the start of the spring , an increase in real estate sales would now be seen for the next few months , which would " be subject to " real tests " of the market .
“ Looking at persistently high rates of auctional prices , generally rapid sales , and persistently low interest rates , it is likely that home prices will rise even more over the next three months , ” he said .
In a comment to the New Press , he disagrees with executive statements , attacking " like a field master . "
This is not , it is said , the style of higher education .
For example , the Medau family was already " barely informed in mid-June of the seminary 's request .
The statement that the plans were announced only in July is definitely wrong , ” he said .
At the same time , he points out that the plans are not " designs , even decisions , " but there are " preferences . "
Closure is also less dramatic than it is feared by Medal .
There was , and is , a nine-meter street .
It ’ s 5.50 meters below its current level , which is a meter more widely than it has been , ” explains peddling .
The argument made by Medau-operators that their free and school-free parking space will be used only by university students in the future does not want to hold idle .
No small fix can be made at all , because , as in other public parking centers , this can now be intelligently solved .
Thinking to the Residents
According to the Child Cross Bergy , which is located on its doorstep and would lead to the passage to the parking deck on its doorstep , according to higher education presidents , " it is said , " it will not be compromised . "
Rather , he says , " It is not just about child flu , but also about bringing in the Friedmans Road and the 800 students of neighboring real school .
So it is about far more than the vested interests of Mr. Medau . "
Whether criticism of the child flu ’ s parent , with which the street would be scaled up , “ would be lost to one of the few soft patches of Coburgs , ” can " determine readers themselves . "
At the beginning of October , worshirts want to inform Bamberg , along with the National Bureau , the councils on the development of higher education by 2020 , " and in this context address the importance of the new development . "
Last week , Peer Medau informed the children ’ s crystal parents about the university ’ s plans .
Thus , the new parking deck is not to travel , as it has been , across the campus and gravegetables , but rather across the Medau-Berg .
This would require expanding the fine road to about a kilometer of double-digit life .
According to Medal ’ s projections , traffic in the park of Schloss of High Level would increase ten-fold .
Of roughly 2,000 vehicles a day , talk is rampant .
The city has not wanted to speak out .
Glorif Returns from a Clall National Team
Holger Gland will no longer play for the DHB team .
The 31-year-old Federal Religious SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision .
The decision did not please me easily ; it has been rushed for several months .
It is time for me to listen to my body 's signals and end my career in the national team , " the 2007 World Cup told me on his Facebook page .
He thus runs on a balance sheet of 167 countries and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement .
Because the much-vaunted backup player of Flensbourg ’ s Champions-League victor wants to go on to death for several years now , he is no longer available to the new federal prosecutor , Dagur Sigurdsson .
With Iceland , which announces on the Tuesday its cadres for country games against Switzerland , Glorf led a " long and good conversation .
His ideas and approaches have eagerly haunted me , just as they will enthusiasm my longtime co-players and successors .
But , for my club , I want to be healthy for years to come , which requires longer regenerational exchanges that do not allow the current double burden .
The left had even feared its career after a finished infection in 2012 .
Because of Achilles ’ problems , he had been treated by German cell-phone doctors ( DHB ) with a cortisoon-injection injection that later triggered strong disaggregation .
Emergency operation and two more interventions followed .
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team physician , and the controversy ended with a comparison .
Twelve years of Profi and 11 years of national team careers do not sit on a body without a trace .
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore .
After the three infectious football operations that briefly occurred in 2012 , I have never properly grabbed my blood pressure .
This includes some other disguised complaints .
As early as the year , I noted that while I can control my head , I can not deceive my body , ” Gland orf told the magazine " Handball Time " in the interview .
He would be ready for a comeback only in an absolute emergency .
" When all the rivers break , I 'm always ready for discussion , " the dual father told the professional magazine .
But I can count the years in which I can still play football at one hand .
I must also say that , after my long hospital period in 2012 , I have also become rather humble about my health .
After my career , I want at least to be able to go somewhat .
In 2008 ( HSG North Horn ) and 2010 ( TBV Lemgo ) , in addition to the World Cup title 2007 and the profits of the Champions League , he delivered the EHF pokal .
In 2012 , he also secured , with Flensbourg , the post-European political victory .
Germany ’ s Economy contracted by 0.2 % in the spring
The crises that gripped the world economy in the second quarter have held back the German economy .
GDP fell by 0.2 % from April to late June 2014 , compared to the headquarters .
This divided the Federal Statistical Office , confirming temporary calculations .
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
Foreign trade , too , slowed the economy .
Thanks to a strong annual rise , the first half of this year overall implies a 0.8 % GDP gap from the second half of 2013 .
Horstmar was the starting point and the target of the " Munisterland Moire " that first ran through the Burgmanstown on Sunday .
The Burgmannese town of Horstmar , on Sunday , witnessed an invasion of Dutch `` heretics drivers . ' '
The largest sports federation of the Netherlands , NTFU , hosted the so-called " Munisterlant Moires . "
It is the largest radar quer in Muniquer , the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands .
More than 1,000 participants , with their registration at Jos Huerne , needed to organize the rally through the Munior country .
The tour was offered in various journals .
We come from the heroes and are driven overnight to participate in this rally .
We want to learn the Munisterland in this way as well , " and the cyclists rejoiced about the route through the circles of Steinfurt , Borks , and Coesfeld .
After registering in the United Kingdom of the protégé Brotherhood Sta .
Katharina entered a small " peace " trip through the city over Wall , where the start was also underway .
Further , the route written for three different categories led to heroism over the beautiful mountain to the coesfield , and back to Horstmar by Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
On lines of 95 kilometers of 175 cares , 120 kilometers of oceans with 1475 cares , and 145 kilometers with 1775 cares , cyclists proved their good conditionality .
They have been put forward in Havixbeck and Billerbeck .
The chief organizer , Jos Huerne , and Mayor Heinz Loil-fing , showed much pleasure about the success of this cyclist Events .
We are satisfied , and it was a beautiful experience for all involved .
The organization went without problems , and there were no negative incidents , " draws Heinz Loil-fing a positive conclusion .
Unfortunately , not as many participants came as the organizer hoped , owing probably to poor weather forecasts and rainfall .
" We see again in 2015 , one hopes , with beautiful weather on August 30 , or during another weekend , " but we pledged to return the cyclists to Municipal land and reclaim the contemporaries .
Constantin Wecker ’ s Dishonest Memoirs
It is , in fact , more philosophical testimony than biography , which brought Konstantin Wecker , Honest Machist , Pazifist , to police , ex-detainee , into " monks and warriors , " on 287 pages .
It is not chronological , but more thought networks of thought , that the Munich born on June 1 , 1947 , put down his memoirs , every chapter inaugurated by a fitting song .
And he is relentlessly honest : from the oneself as a high school of gymnasiast to ladder theft , and from drug use , he does not expose any human weakness .
So , too , has he learned how to treat his fellow human beings for his own tolerance .
There are also abstract but even more important terms : love , soul , ego , Sein , who is now trying to press spirituality - all of which he tries to do , in a very philosophical , but also a very personal , way .
He also explains his pacifism , his social critique , his political commitment - and , as he coined not only music ( opera leader became soul and rock musician ) , but also his prison term .
The latter , he says , has brought the Lebean Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk who " generates subtraction , " as he says , " by sweeping away everything unnecessary . "
But there are also short anecdotes between the high mindset of the mind : beatings in a GIs local , for example , or a delusional motory-vehicle in which he ran head-on a tree .
There , too , he is relentless .
Lenny Henry : My father never took me to my arms .
Never said , “ I love you . ”
Henry was one of seven children of a Yamaican family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry 19 was , worked in a factory , and her relationship was limited .
Henry is standing up for a comedy , Rudy ' s Rare Records , partly based on imaginary conversation with his father and arose from the series on radio 4 .
The soundtrack is a combination of Reggae and Rap , with vivid melodias .
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
He visited " many " therapies after his mother died , and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
It was hard to know him .
You never saw his face , only ended his voice : " Mr. with the tide .
Let your sister be calmed .
Moving !
I want to look at cricket .
My older brothers , Seymour and Hilton , who had grown up when I was a child , went to his knees and talked about things like the form of biergy or the beauty of cricketing .
I have never had such a conversation with him .
He was a corner for much of my life , the newspaper ’ s serious type .
Henry recently opened a shootball in Dudley , and , while conditions are better than in his father ’ s time , he gained a glimpse of how life was for him .
It is now a bit brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stygic labyrinthe flamboyroid and smoke .
My father used to simply walk in the wall , and then was slowly told how to sing him because he could wash the glass .
When I went there , I realized that he had done the job for years to get food on the table , and my respect for it became greater .
Yet Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ faiths .
My father never embraced me ; he never said , " I love you . "
Only when my mother was doing poorly at the end of her life did we begin to say , " I love to tell you " I love you . "
Through his own daughter cheap , with Dawn French , he was able to share the love he lacked as a child .
Can you stop watching " I love you ? "
Let me get around !
Papa , I am 22 !
With Dawn French .
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends ?
It is a great mother .
It is still pleased with French , with whom he was married for 25 years .
Dawn is a good person .
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends ?
It is a great mother .
Henry ’ s own mother was a diatician .
This helped them die .
So when I became very , overweight , and symptoms of diabetes showed that my doctor said , " you must be radical .
So I drew this fitting and had to make a dramatic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It is very difficult .
And it is hard to do .
No one likes to eat carnivors .
Henron ’ s career shift may be reflected in his elegant short-cut barrel .
Ever since he was praised for his ethello , the theater has captured him .
The comedy followed , and then Fences Wilson of August .
This is a different experience from that of the seats and comedy that have filled out his business life .
He began with just 16 years when he was working in a factory .
One DJ discovered him when he imitated and wrote about New Faces .
His television career began in the mid-1970 's . " I was the only black imitator / comedian on television for a fairly long time . "
He learned in the profession .
I had to be big not only in front of the public eye , but also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient waitze-tale machine , while TV star was a star , and that was really difficult .
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the right of refrigeration on the brown and White Minscl Show , a slight entertainment program in which people were " black , " Henry Comedy introduced for more than five years .
My family was unpleasant .
I wish somehow that it had never happened , but I do not regret that I did .
It was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
But this " longtime low-cost pillar of British television " was also a " grotesque parody of black people . "
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture , Henry worked in the 1980 ’ s on an alternative comedy circle .
The first line of Lenny Henry Show was sent in 1984 , and in the 1990 ’ s he was known , among other things , as the kitchen leader of Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie !
Advertising " documentary movies , telephony , and filmmaking movies shaped his next decade , but , after his BCC series of LennyHenry.tv in 2008 , he thought , " What you do next , because it feels as if you can only look for time or trip in place . "
Then came a radio documentary series four entitled What ' So Great About ?
The first consequence was Shakespeare .
I was typically allergic at Shakespeare .
I had never really learned about him in school , and mostly thought of him as middle class dominance , whites in structural hotels , and a coal coalmine .
So I was afraid .
Everyone we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , " Judi Dench , " said Du shaltest .
Don ’ t look bad if you don ’ t know what you call .
Never mind a few words , and then you understand why we all love Shakespeare .
Henry instituted 20 lines of Othellos ’ s last speech on the document film , and was enthusiastic .
I felt that I could do that .
It was almost as if someone had finally put me right .
" It 's a matter of serious , don ' t care , don ' t get your text , think of you .
The samples were brutal , and I learned this piece of it for months before we did it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
He soon joined the comedy of errors .
Suddenly , I was in the national theater , and I could hardly believe it .
There was a moment when I thought " Oh , you hasten you . "
There was a technical mistake , and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience .
" A small voice told me , " You must now bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer . "
Instead , the refrigerator announced that once the problem was resolved , the idea would continue .
I went from the scene to something I said , " Oh said , " Thank God . "
I am not responsible .
I can leave it to someone else .
" You play in a piece of theater , so you remain in your role . "
Henry at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding .
Panic is very good , which strengthens longings .
This , too , has been fine : it is like a big sign of gods who tell me , " This is your destiny . "
He says this , of course , with a DONNERNDA voice .
So I remain there .
I really love this .
I love being in a profit room .
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is riddled with humorous outbreaks , while repeatedly imitating people .
I have decided not to make a stand-alone comedy , because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
Looking at this , it feeds on a wall .
I sometimes live in the Apollo when I am eager for it , but there is less overall than before .
I ask him whether he will ever again make a standard comedy .
The fun I have in a space with a director who helps shape a start , a middle class , and the end of a journey -- I don ' t think I ever want to give up .
So , is this his new incarnation ?
I think so .
I like an actor .
It is fun .
It always tells a story , and that is great .
I love stories .
People love stories .
Huthi rebels blocked the streets in Yemen ’ s capital
In the conflict between the Shia Houthi rebels and Yemen ’ s government , the Houthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital , Sanaa .
Huthi supporters would have occupied key roads in Sanaa on Monday , said one Speaker of the Huthi Party " Ansar Allah . "
It also blocked access to parliament .
Yemeni media report traffic jams in the capital .
According to the newspaper 's online edition " Yemen Post , " Huthik leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday 's night .
Huthi , according to the tables , threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met .
The Shia Houthis struggles for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and calls for the government to resign .
The Huthi people ’ s family has been beating Yemeni ’ s capital for almost two weeks .
Roughly 30,000 rebels have built protest camps at Sanaa ’ s large grassroots Sanaa .
Around the country , bloody fighting with Yemeni ’ s army continues to occur .
Kenya registered civil servants to curb “ ghost ” employees
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to extinguish " ghost employees " from the government 's payrolls .
Those who do not register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid were they told a government share .
The government suspects that thousands of people will be paid even after they leave the civil service .
When President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013 , he promised to fight corruption in public services .
A review earlier this year found that at least $ 1 million ( $ 700,000 ) a month was lost on " ghost " payments and other abusive financial practices .
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts after a person died or leaves public services , Wanyama Chebusiri reports that he will continue to be paid for the BBC from the capital , Nairobi .
All officials must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometrical registration are included , has been reported in a government news story .
Everyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be slashed by the payroll list was still told .
" This action will go a long way toward rationalizing the civil service by identifying the actual number of civil servants , as well as by cleaning up salary lists at both levels of government , " eliminating " mental-health employees , " said Anne Waiguru , the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning .
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach is being negotiated for the first time on November 11 .
Five inheritors from Berthold Albrecht , the son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht , are demanding € 19.4 million in damage replacement of Axis and two of his companies in bankruptcy proceedings in a civil suit at the Uzbekistan City village .
This shared a lawyer on Monday .
The clothes are said to have cheated rooftop purchases of art plants and omniposts , and to compute Berthold Albreach with higher prices than actually paid .
This has also made the required revision higher .
Eighth , for € 121 million , the value of the old is fixed .
Children Need River
He was in school for 44 years , of which 23 were the primary school ladder .
In that time , Manfred Judges know many peer-makers and collaborators of their time as students .
His methods were sometimes unconventional , but always guided by his desire to see the student go .
The snowfall is the best-known mountain of the tree .
Manfred judges love the painting with his home ’ s motive .
Judges were born in 1930 in Trautenau and North Heights ; now Trutnov .
He was already interested in teacher after four years .
A year later , the Sudeten Germans were expropriated .
Within a half-hour , the family had to leave its house .
After a few months in one camp , Bavaria went to 1946 – in the Guardian Gorge .
So it sent judges to the upper house of Senkaif .
Teachers ’ education took place in Bamberg .
In addition , Manfred judges had to go to school six kilometers a week , with the pathway to Bamberg , where three kilometers pass through the town to school .
After two months , Manfred Judges received a bedroom in a Red Cross Heim at Bamberg : along with up to 15 fellow combatants in a bedroom .
In 1951 , he made the first and after three years of Lehman ’ s presidential term the second name .
Since he lacked a free teacher for him , he went to the upper bazaar on November 1 , 1954 , to the school in a halt .
The " traitor room " was his first " service " home in the school house .
In 1958 , he invoked a three-room service in the rebuilt house of teachers next to school .
That house bought Manfred Judge in 1980 , after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968 .
Until then , there have been three classes and five classes in petershell breaks at the Petershell Association .
Starting in the 1968-69 school year , they were summarized in petershauts in today ’ s Rathouse .
When the school federation was established , the primary school was left .
To avoid a downgrade in the smaller school , then rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld and Manfred Judge .
But petershautes grew , and so , starting in September 1982 , children and their teachers could draw on today ’ s construction , which was expanded by Judge ’ s retirement in 1997 .
Manfred judges praise the intricate generosity of then-Mayor Ludwig Götz , who built cellular space at the expense of community and enlargement in 1997 , though this was not appropriate under the guidelines of school construction .
" Mayor Götz was very guilty , " Judge was grateful .
Throughout his career , Manfred Judge never forgot the speeches of a government official who responded to a referenda by a school council on law and justice : " You must never forget love . " Manfred judges implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
" One must tell the children two things : roots and wings , " says today 's 84-year-old .
And he learned , " Don ' t always do it ; " Whether he means only his students , or just his own six children , is not entirely clear .
In any case , judges have sometimes been unconventional .
When students beat , they did not get some punitive work from him , nor were they allowed to sit by .
At the community ’ s expense , judges had created two pairs of box-stove stoves , and allowed the two contrasts to compete , even though there were some breaks .
For the sake of the school , judges used to have a good relationship with then-Mayor Ludwig Götz ( CSU ) .
He induced partisan judges to run for retirement , at least in 1996 , as the last on the CSU list for the Community .
But judges were elected six-place , and joined the CSU .
180 kilometers in Three Days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers in the Kurk of Bad Salzhot Shots and Scots Stall
When Radler walks on her tour in Bad Salzhot or Scots Race , it is not something special in itself .
On Friday , however , the mere number of caste looked like a mere number : the 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour and Bebyttross had pause in the lower Kurk of Bad Salzhose , and later a Free-Radtour party in Altburgpark .
Under the slogan " Radles and celebrations on newfound routes between Nidda and Children , " the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a Van Baker & Band concert .
On Friday , it became serious : the rampage began the first hits that struck 60 kilometers from Flortown to Bad Salzhot , and still to Shots .
In Bad Salzhausen , mayor Hans-Peter See , who had launched the bicycle in Bad Vilbel , was greeted with the head of Bad Salzhose , Petra Schwing village .
Everything had been prepared for the healing of the body and mind : the countrymen of Ranstadt and the Dutch Mocktown had squipped 85 lead bullets , coercive , streamlining , and cages that made the sobery cyclists wonderful .
" Such pie can only paint women factories , " praised one participant from ultra-salary , while he picked another pie .
On the corner of Turn-Nidda , cold freezes could be invented .
The " Duo Bravo " kept visitors from known melodias surgies and musicals , and appointed enthusiastic applause .
The Park ’ s beautiful ambition was relaxing .
One Mr. also enjoyed a headscarf from his partner : " It deserved to be restored , after all , to fractured bicycle chains . "
Meanwhile , the mayor and operator have had to work , interviewed at the well before the print house of reporters Rainer Jank , and used the opportunity to lobby for Bad Saleshhausen on radio .
Promotion leader Tobias Hagen has also briefly dissipated since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 , when he was involved in plenty of local engineering .
His pickup Truck , in which he communicated with his staff and the police 15-member motorcycle plant Hate , wrote Facebook contracts , and made reporting books , also needed a check .
" Most of the participants come from the Rhein-Main area , " he said , " but from cattle or floodgage , wildlife , and even many cities in the West have traveled radar drivers .
Participation is a bit about transmission capacity at its disposal .
In category I , participants are housed in hotels , in category II in collection shelters .
From the Kurdish town , the cyclists looked good when they rebounded after a week and a half : " Czechs ! "
" It was beautiful in Bad Salzhot ! " They waited to leave .
After the Scots arrived , the group was allowed to take a brief respite .
But on evening , the radar in the idyllic Alteburgpark were called for .
Under Scottish society for tourism and urban marketing ( GTS ) governance , the Park had received a beautiful feast , and of course it had been prepared to pull the plug , such as flames with well-cooled barbers .
Mayor Susanne Schaab , GTS CEO Markus Hosfeld , and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner Sachs all welcomed the visitors as CEO of the ADAC Hessen-Thürge .
The three were visibly pleased by the " many Scottish factories . "
DJ ’ s dogs then released the tanks .
The opportunity to flourish under free heaven was used jealously , despite sports on the bicycle .
Among customers , citizens who were as fed up with the good mood as those of cyclists were .
On the second day , the Birstein , Guardian , and Bad Orb stations - including a corporation with the trenches - were on the agenda .
Yesterday , after 180 kilometers of Radeln , athletes returned to Bad Vills .
Dozens of Turkish Policemen are arrested for " conspiracy " against the government .
Overall , 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey on the grounds of the `` conspiracy against the government ' ' of local media agencies .
The police authorities issued no immediate comment .
Among the detained are 14 senior police officers , Hürriyet Daily News .
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government workers , including four government ministers last December .
In July , a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly establishing organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ( who was then Prime Minister ) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Gül against him and others in positions of power .
Not all Children in Ukraine Return to School
Schools throughout Ukraine opened on Monday ( September 1 ) after summer ’ s vacations .
This day is traditionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arseniy Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
He told warning journalists that not all schools had reopened , but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations :
September ’ s celebrations were not held in every school .
The sky is not all over Ukraine peacefully .
We must fight for peaceful heaven .
The whole of Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian People ’ s Front , must fight for peaceful heaven .
Aleksan Pastukhow , the school ’ s schoolmaster in Slawjansk who attends Jazenjuk ’ s daughter , spoke in Russian .
We hope that peace is finally back here , and that children get an education that will benefit them further in life .
The first school day of the new year is traditionally celebrated , with children wearing hooked shirts , holding balloons in their hands , and putting flowers on their teachers .
With Rona Fairhead , the BBC may have found the great director it needs .
It arrives with a proud glory flu from the banking world , media management , and the inner circle of the Tory Party .
And it has its own frontline experience .
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co. , changing for Morgan Stanley , Bombadians , ICI , and the media world of Pearson .
She chaired the Financial Times Board for seven years , and resigned when the parent company ’ s top post Pearson went to a younger male colleague .
Their severance was supposedly almost € 1 million .
Their political rankings , too , are solid .
She was recommended by Lord Browne , the former BP Chairman , when he searched for more private economic knowledge in whitehall : she became the cabinet ’ s adviser .
Her husband is an earlier telling council member .
As early as May , I described the Chairman ’ s job with a poisoned edge .
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life , but it also has an internal paradox in its structure .
Confidence works in two directions : inward reliance on the BBC ’ s first guard of its managerial ethics hierarchy , but also on the outside world , as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong .
This produces an almost untenable duopoly , requiring a comprehensive reform .
But the new chairman would risk running , beating on everything , and picking up an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty , while perhaps depriving himself of his job .
It is a difficult task .
And , if that were not enough , many are still interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power , money , and status – outpaced .
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old , comfortable safeguards , the upcoming process of royalties for the BBC carries special risks .
For the modest amount of $ 145.50 per year , the British public certainly buys into the world ’ s largest media company .
The BBC tells a good story : it says that it reaches 96 % of all households and costs only 40 Pence per day .
And the BBC seems to be rising again on the popularity scale : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % a decade ago .
The BBC ’ s naval and utilization habits have changed : I now grab news headlines on my cell phone , and see missed programs later on my iPlayer .
But it remains a very loved and notable institution .
She needs a notable chairman - I hope she has found him .
Perry from Texas says that mitigating Tweet was not authorized
One tweet of Texas ’ s Republican Governor Rick Perry ’ s official user account on Sunday contained a corrosive remark on the Democratic district prosecution of his rule .
The tweet was later wiped out and replaced with another of Perry ’ s user ’ s account , which took place before that .
It is precisely a tweet that I had not authorized .
“ I don ’ t endorse the tweet and wiped it out , ” the later news said .
Perry staff did not respond immediately to comments .
Although the tweets of Perry ’ s office were phased out , it was not clear who actually serves the Feed .
In the former tweet , an unfavorable picture of the county prosecutor of Travis County , Rosemary Lehmberg , was recorded in April 2013 for drunk .
Perry vetoed funding for her office when she refused to resign , leading to a prosecution against Perry , who might be a 2016 presidential candidate , earlier this month in Austin before Grand Jury .
The tweet 's text is that " I don ' t always drill with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but when I can , I propose Governor Perry when he spells it out . "
I am the most dark democracy in Texas .
Lehmberg ’ s office was not charged with guiding the Grand Jury against Perry .
Michael McCrum , a special prosecutor from San Antonio , was run by a Republican judge .
Perry pleads not guilty , calling the charges a political trick .
His cherished team of jurisdictions requested the case of judges to reject charges , arguing that the law used to address the longest-serving governor in Texas ’ s history is unfathomably diffuse .
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government funds to the state 's Public Integrity Unit , based in Travis County and identified corruption in Texas in government cases , when Lehmberg refused to resign .
This veto ensured public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group .
Perry ’ s official user account is often updated – and sometimes famous .
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election meetings during his 2012 presidential candidacy , Perry responded to speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of photos from near a sea , in the words " South Carolina , We Next ! "
Berkeley Again calls the Housing Market “ Normal ”
One of London 's most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England has returned " to normal levels . "
Households in the capital were hot and subject to massive price increases , prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage lending in June , owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble .
As Tony Pidgley , the founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley , said on Monday , " Since the current financial years began , the market has returned to normal levels of transactions since the peak of 2013 , " adding that this offers a " stable change of action . "
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
According to the Crown Board , prices in urban areas alone rose by 18.5 % last year , far more than average in England and Wales .
Average sales prices for Berketty ’ s private , low-cost , and incremental offers rose by about one-fifth a year and stood at $ 423,000 in late April .
But a stronger pound has made property ownership less attractive to foreign buyers in London in recent months – some have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible " Vills tax " before the general election next May .
The London real-estate maker Foxton warned last week that the mortgage report for April , when more severe lending successes were introduced , would also lead to slower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year .
New data from the Bank of England show a decline in mortgage approval in July , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
Hamptions International , another real-estate agency , revised its forecast of rising home prices in London to 3 % in 2015 , on the basis of an already weakening housing price .
The volume of transaction in the most expensive areas of London , such as Chelsea , Mayfairo , and Kensington , has fallen by a quarter year after year , according to the broker WA Ellis .
Nevertheless , the desire for home in the capital , Berkeley , is a boon , because the maturing amounts of future sales amount to more than £ 2.2 billion .
Mr Pidgley added : " Demand for the right , well-designed product in the best locations remained stable , and , as a result , futures sales remain stable . "
In June , the company reported selling 3,742 new homes by the end of April – nearly one-third more than the pre-crisis peak of 2007 .
The annual pretax result rose by 40 % annually , to £ 280 million , and sales rose by 18 % , to $ 1.6 billion .
In a paper on Monday before the company ’ s annual meeting , Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley this year are expected to match current market expectations .
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pretax outcome to £ 450 million .
Berkeley shares were fixed at £ 23.96 on afternoon in London .
Naktto photos of Jennifer Lawrence by Hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence occurs at the 85 th Oscarl ceremony .
Nackttos of the Ottoman Nobel laureate Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a " master list " of pictures another 100 starlets .
One star 's " The Tribunals of Panem " confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine , accusing the hackers of " blatant injury of privacy . "
The authorities have been notified , and will persecute all those who continue the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence .
The photographs originally postponed on the photo sharing side were supposedly created by a gap in the online storage system by Apple ’ s icloud . The alleged “ master list ” of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars , including Rihanna , Kim Kardashian , Mary Elizabeth Were , and Mary Kings Olsen , reported Buffed Bued Bued Fean .
It is not certain how many of the images are genuine , though Wolls " Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world " also condemned Twitter .
" To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I received years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you will be so genuinely satisfied with you , " writes wrote on Twitter .
But Victoria Justice of the nickologic series " iCarly " and " Victorious " did not deny that the photographs are pictures of them and titles " of these so-called needle images of me , GEFLCHT , people .
Neither begin at all , nor does * wording game intend .
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday that a pop spokesman , Ariana Grande , denied the honesty of the alleged photos of them .
Exclusive exit from Howard Jacobson 's cherished new novel about love and letter " J . "
They disintegrated , it was best described , that they were slowly unraveling like a carton being drowned out .
Occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , demanding , intensive , distancing , and perhaps intransigence .
And then he shake his hand .
He knew about Kratzicism .
He was stubborn , as in Igel , yes .
The last victim of this vengeance was a just beginning affair , which had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual , and might even have brought him some satisfaction .
Ailinn Solomon was a trembling beauty , with countless hair and a flourishing heart from a village on the coordinator that was even more remote and smoother than Port Reuves .
She had come to the south with an older analogy that thought she was her aunt , and that inherited a land in a mob but paradise valley called Paradise Valley .
For several years , no one had lived in the house .
The plumbing was leaky , the trees were still spies , packages had left their traces on all windows , and believed that they belonged to it all , and the garden was exuberant with resentment that looked like huge coalmines .
It was like a child-mouth house , both threatening and tempting , a guarantee full of secrets .
Portrait of the author : Howard Jacobson , whose novel " J " is on the Long list of Booker 's prize in 2014 .
The Shortlist list is announced next week .
Kevern had sneezed with Ailinn on the shattered high grass looms and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon . Both had been chastened into the service consolation , which soothing the country with calming music and apprehension news when the sight of its wrecked brown bunes had put him on a long cry in the hands of an old father .
your feet is too big .
Because of their own aggressiveness , Song ’ s role in this kind was no longer consoled .
Not forbidden - nothing was so really prohibited - simply did not play .
Success has been obsolete , just as the word is obsolete .
The general taste created what forgiveness and regulation never achieved , and how people in books chose the Vom Tell-millionaire memoirs , cooking books , and songs , they chose the Ballades in music .
In the euphoria of the day , Kevern began to play an imaginary camp and to fill great feet in a grob-comic serenade of Ailinns .
Ailinn did not understand this .
" This was a famous song by a jazestant named Fat Wall , " he explained it , and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
This had always done so for his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth .
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
His father had played it with his own father , he said .
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers above your lip , you cost a penny .
It had not been a very noxious game back then , and it was not very funny now .
He knew what he expected ; that was all that .
It had to explain what Jazz was .
Ailinn had never heard that story .
Jazz , though not forbidden directly , was not playing .
Improvisation was no longer modern .
It was only space for a single " if " in life .
People wanted to be quite certain at the beginning of a meloden where it would end .
So is reason .
Its unpredictability made people nervous .
And jazz was music with expressed reason .
Although he had grown 10 years old without hearing of Sammy Davis Junior , Kevern knew something about Jazz of his father ’ s semi-secret collection of old CDs .
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats was black .
At their age , she probably could not recall a time when pop singers were not black .
Once again , there were no laws or constraints .
A conscientious society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group adoption - grateful as it did from destiny .
People with African-Caribbean backgrounds were suited and burned by temperament and body building for entertainment and sports .
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were , like nature , governed by electronic talent and charged with ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service telephone .
What was left of the Polish community was calisation ; what was left of the Greeks was shattered .
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WAS GESCHENS WAR , WENN ES GESCHES WAR , fearing that fire fire fire fire , even fearing that the flames would consume them next , had been opened up for lab and Shisham restaurants .
Each according to his capabilities .
Since she had heard only Ballades , Ailinn found it hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just made could be spared .
Music reflected love .
" They are not truly insulting , " said Kevern .
Perhaps except for people whose feet is too big .
My father never insulted anyone , but he loved that song .
He talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive sense of security .
Nothing could overcome the parallels of the huge coal-fired leaves .
Ailinn still did not understand .
Why would your father have loved that ?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux , but delayed putting two fingers on the lips in their present .
They thought that he was something strange anyway .
" It seemed to him , " he said instead .
They threw their heads around indefinitely and closed their eyes on the downside .
Around the world , there was nothing to see their untested black hair .
There was nothing he wanted otherwise .
" If you say it , " she means without conviction .
But this does not explain why you are singling out me .
It seemed genuinely concerned .
Are my feet too big ?
He saw again .
Don ’ t have your feet so directly .
Perhaps your clothes , a little bit ...
And do you say you hate me because my necessities are too fat ?
Hate you ?
Of course , I don ’ t hate you .
That is just the stupid song .
He could have said , " I love you , " but it was too early to do so .
“ You need your kernel just why you like me , ” he instead tried .
I am a bit perverse .
That did not sound right .
It was supposed to be comical .
When he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble , because , like his father , he did not have the reassuring charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes .
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
Perhaps he wanted to be a skin .
Despite his friendly eyes .
Ailinn Solomon was red and raised from her favorite chair , drowned the consols , and wasted the wine they had drowned .
Holunderbourg wine , so drunk was no excuse for him .
In their excitement , she seemed to be trembling like Palmwedel in the storm .
“ And your dickhead is precisely why I feel perverse to you , ” she said ...
Except that I am not at all .
She was tired of him , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that they saw when she stood up to him .
Think he would beat them ?
She had not told him of life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown , but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here .
The same vast and jealous ocean broke there as there was on the shores .
The same confused men , with even thicker skin and more abysmal after DEM WAS GESCHEVAR , when their forebears had been their smugglers and rogues , have drawn from Kneipe to Kneipe , always willing to rise up their hand against a woman who refused or lost his hand .
Dickchef ?
That would have shown you a fat fist if she did not fit !
It was the most widely used word for an erotic appeal between men and women , an antidote to the mindless favorite packs of the Konsole - they smashed and then beat .
According to Ketz , this was an unnecessary refinement , as the Kuchens themselves were an act of violence .
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign by her body .
He rose from the love chair like an old man .
She also felt lasting , but the wreckage of his mourning caught her by surprise .
That was not the end of the world .
They hardly knew .
She watched him evacuate , as he did from a upper floor in his upper floor , a man who complained about what he had acquired .
Adam left the Garden , she thought .
She felt sudden pain for him and men in general , though some had raised their hands against her .
A man turned away from her back , bowing , shaming , beating , losing a fighting spirit - why was this a look that she seemed to know well when she could not recall when she could not recall a single time that she had seen before today ?
When she was alone again , Ailinn Solomon looked on her feet .
Several years before the just told incidents , Esme Nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioning Ofnow , the non-legislative oversight body for public sentiment , was on a short lecture about continued low - and middle-class violence in the very areas where reducing , if not elimination , was most likely to be expected in the energy supply , and investing in the violence .
" Much has already been done , and much more needs to be done , " she wrote , " to assuage the born aggressiveness of a people who fought thousands of wars and won most of them , especially in the country 's remote corners and valleys , where the sweet of human friendship has been historically rarely felt , despite the looming church gaps between the hecks .
But some attributes turn out to be irrevocable .
The higher the churchurchtom , it seems , the less passion he continues to inspire .
The population wears sentimental ballades , searches of stories of overdue difficulties , and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the former cruelty keep rural communities firmly in control , as well as in our urban contexts , but also in the emergence of new and wicked domestic , workplace , and even in the field .
“ They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , ” she said when he read the report .
I suggest that you read fewer novels .
Esme Nussbaum cut her head .
I must also ask : are you atheist ?
" I think I don ' t think I don ' t have to say , " answered Esme Nussbaum .
Are you reading ?
Again , Esme invoked her right to privacy and denial of the statement .
Feminists ?
Again , silence .
" I don ' t ask , " said Luther Rabinowitz after all , " because I was against atheism , reading , or feminism .
This is a prejudicious job .
We serve as a prejudicious society .
But certain types of hypersensitivity , fully acceptable and laudable in itself , can occasionally distort outcomes that you have imagined .
You obviously have prejudices about the Church , and these things you call " deceptive " and " red " may as well be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vigor and vitality .
Moving on the sidelines , WAS GESCHENS IST , WENN GESCHENS IST , as if yesterday , should it have happened , means taking the country its substantial vitality .
Esme Nussbaum looked around , while Rabinowitz spoke .
Behind his head , an LED writing in Flamingorosa reiterated the advice Ofnow had given to the country over the last quarter-century or more .
Smile your neighbors , value your partner , listen to Ballades , visit music , use your phone , talk you , listen to you , and listen to you .
Speaking is better than silence ; the healthy word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
“ I understand absolutely what you want , ” Esme Nussbaum answered calmly when she was sure that her superiors had come to an end , ” and I say nothing more than that we are not as effectively cured as we imagine ourselves .
My concern is that , without warning , we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to DEM WAS GESHENT , WENN ES GESHENHENS IST .
This time , however , it is not the others we leave our rage and distrust .
Luther Rabinowitz shaped pyramid with hands .
To suggest a sense of impatience .
" You go too far , " he said , " when you call actions " mistakes " that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
You go too far when you talk about them leaving out their " rage " and their " distrust " of " others . "
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we speak of " us " and " others . "
There was no " us " and there were no " others . "
It was a time of disorder that is all we know .
" No part of society can claim to have behave well , " if we are honest about ourselves . "
I am not prosecuting anyone .
Whether bad or well done what happened has happened .
That was then .
Nothing more needs to be said - there is a consensus .
And just as no culpability must be blamed , so , too , must not be extinguished if such repayments were appropriate , and if there were a way to extinguish them .
But what the past does not do if we don ' t learn from it ;
The past serves us to forget it .
If I are allowed to say :
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid fall apart .
“ I will consider their report , ” he said and dismissed it .
The next day , when she went to work as usual , a motorcycle driver who , as Passonds describe , had been driven onto the footpath in a way of " brutal rage . "
There are accidents .
Lesothothothothood military member says that no coup is planned ; Prime Minister remains in South Africa .
Military officials in Lesotho argued that they planned a coup to overthrow the government , and said that they were committed to police officers charged with arming political fanatics .
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the country ’ s army had reshuffled its residence and occupied government buildings in the capital , Maseru .
The prime minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting on assassination threats .
Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup , but that the military responded to the threat posed by " political fanatics " whose armed forces were about .
" What happened tomorrow , " he said to Voice of America , " was the stuff of defense forces acting in Lesotho after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements , in fact , wanted to arm some of the political and partisan fanatics that were about to wreak havoc .
Clayson Monyela , South African government spokesman , said that military action seemed overthrown .
" While no one has claimed to have torn the government by force , all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup , " he said .
Speaker of the military Lesotho said on Sunday that soldiers would retire to their barracks and settle in the capital .
In the meantime , Vice Premier Mothetyoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabanes ’ absence .
Thabane said that he thought he was targeted because of his attempts to combat corruption at home .
Since June , there has been great tension in Lesotho , after Thabane parliamentary meetings suspended in his unity government , owing to the clashes over his government .
He said that his actions had not undermined the government , despite loud accusations .
Eurozone output at a 13-month low
The rise in output in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months , according to a closely observed study .
The final brand of shopping managers ( PMI ) fell to 50.7 in August , from 51.8 levels in July .
One issue above 50 is expansion .
New contracts declined , and factories experienced collapses in a time of rising EU-Russia tensions over Ukraine .
The figures are coming before the European Central Bank ( ECB ) meeting on Thursday .
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with a delayed eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of deflation at just 0.3 % inflation .
There is speculation that ECB head Mario Draghi could make more of the same this week , whether he considers quantitative easing for the eurozone , commensurate with those set by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis .
" Although small growth is better than growth at all , " the stunning effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers has become clearer , " said Rob Dobson , a leading economist at Markit .
The Fabrik PMI for Germany , Russia ’ s largest trading partner in the EU , fell to the lowest level in 11 months , with 51.4 .
Meanwhile , in the second largest economy , France , the PMI fell to 46.9 .
France remains a Sorgenkind , as does Italy ’ s shift from solid expansion to stagnation .
Similarly , hints that growth incentives in key industrial technologies , Germany and Spain and the Netherlands , are no longer comforting , " said Mr. Dobson .
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts , who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , the highest level since late 1999 .
Howard Archer , chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight , said : " The best that can be said for the purchasing manager index in the eurozone in August is that the sector continues to grow . "
He added : " Producers in the eurozone are finding life obviously quite difficult now , because today 's heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly over Russia and Ukraine - heighten uncertainty in many countries 's still difficult conditions .
These heightened uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – especially , and consumer confidence – and probably lead to delayed or even cancellation , especially , of some contracts .
He said that it would " become more and more likely " that the ECB , after all , must start some kind of QE , " though we suspect that it will be limited . "
The hell ’ s tenth century passes the survivors of Beslan : ten years have passed since the horrific school siege that their children still suffer .
Ten years ago , Chechen militias held more than 1,000 people hostage in a school in Beslan in southern land .
More than 330 people , more than half of them , were killed in the three-day Martyrium that shocked the world .
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom .
Just a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan School , which killed 34 people , including 186 children , heroic survivors last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine .
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1 , 2004 , the start of a new school year , that seemed like the worst of evil .
The tragedy united West and East , and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of worst misery .
Ten years later , we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims escaped to death in the classroom .
We found surprising young people who overcome resistance , though the memory of this terrorist hell will always follow it .
Their best hope ?
The war now afflicting Ukraine - and infants like it - is ending .
The girl who was photographed in attempting to return to the shocked school sports
She was photographed and famous by Russia ’ s startup photographer Dimitri Beliakov , when she sought only to climb back into the shot school room after a mine exploded .
Never mind Aida searched for her mother Larissa , now 40 years old .
Both were considered dead , but they survived .
“ A woman told me that I should be burning for my life , but I could not , ” Aida said .
My legs were overblown .
I stood up and climbed back to look for my mother .
One soldier put them in safety .
After a series of operations , she thought she was completely cured , but said yesterday : " Three months ago , pain returned .
I fear that I must be restored .
Some grenades are still in my knees .
Their aim now is to become a dentist to help the people how doctors helped them .
" This tragedy changed my life , but it hasn ' t broken me up , " she says .
“ That has happened to me , and it can not be changed .
Once a year , I have always entered the sports room to remember those who stayed there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
Pain is too great .
My best friend and future classroom stadium Dzera Gapoeva was killed there .
We played together when we were small , dreaming of going to school together .
“ I don ’ t want to marry until I complete my studies and start my career .
I think of a family later .
She says that the siege will always remain part of it , though the memory will become a bit weaker every year .
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors , and we are so grateful for the help we get from people in Britain and everywhere .
When I look online at the photo of me as I climb back into school , I think that for the first time , many people see it , understand our disaster , and help prevent such things from happening again .
The young , who fled the bullet , believe his mother was dead .
It was his first day of school ( Russians go to school for seven years ) and survived the three-day siege of his mother ’ s poor .
As he said seven years ago , “ Mama told me that I should declare when there is an explosion and keep a hand . ”
After an explosion , he thought they would die .
" Over time , " she said to him .
He fled , fearful of her being dead , and watched a weeping young child , seized hands and fled through a bullet .
“ Damir told me that his father had died .
“ I could not save them , ” he said .
In reality , Tamara was dumped out , and violated in the hospital with near-injuries , in turn assuming that her son had been killed .
After their reunification , she said , " I was wearing pleasure .
I could not believe .
He burned and impoverished me .
Damir was later flown to London ( now a newspaper , News of the World ) to be titled by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie by a Barnardo ' s Children ' s Champion .
" This horror persecutes you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering , " he said yesterday .
But I can say that it becomes blackwater in my memory .
I still know that I immediately threw away all my game games .
But now I can play computer games with shoots , and that is no problem for me .
" I 'm not afraid to go back to the sports room , but I don ' t think about myself .
I remember these children , with whom I played in the court , and who failed to get out .
We never say that they have been killed or died .
We say that they have remained in the sports Valley .
I remember my trip to London , particularly to the playgrounds where I could choose everything I wanted , and to travel in a top-down car .
But now he is scared about places like Ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered .
This horror persecutes you every day , but I wish I would stop remembering it .
“ I care so much about all those suffering from the grey , ” Damir said Damir , who worked as a volunteer in a closter last week .
I want to help .
I want to go to the police one day , hoping to take me at next year ’ s education seminary .
His mother , 48 , said , “ Are 37 children from our neighborhood killed , can you imagine this ?
I remember the terrible post-siege silence that there were simply no children who could call and run around , and that silence lasted many months .
She vivividly recalls her trip to London with Damir .
London ’ s people wept our history .
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our emotions and show their support .
She was grateful to Blair and her foundation for the price and the possibility of travel to London in the fall of 2004 .
I wish I could call Cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed , but I still remember her and her husband in London , and how the Damir and me helped .
I remember how Damir liked to eat Borschch and called all local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he played with waitters in a restaurant , and Damir shot away with his water pistoves and burned them , playing with him .
And that was just a month after the horror .
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and to support us .
“ I always think that this world has not gotten better in these 10 years .
The war continues in Ukraine now , and people die every day , and I believe that many children have been killed and are killed .
These are just like our children .
I think that for many of the war , part of the news they hear when they are soft or preoccupied with something else .
I just know what these people feel , all the horror .
And I can not stop feeling that way .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
Damir became big and is a very sober and quiet boy ; he is not aggressive or angry at all .
He , for example , does not look for revenge ; he is not overwhelmed by the past grey .
I know that he does not like to recall it , but he has six close friends from the class , and occasionally go to the sports room , arousing candles .
When he was smaller , he suffered - I remember how he sometimes turned to the sofa , the face of us , for hours .
Not sleeping ; his eyes were open .
I also remember how he continued his weapons and other military instruments , now 17 , greater than I look , intelligent , and healthy .
I can hardly believe that I have been so sure for a few hours that he was dead , and I would never see him again .
When I recovered and recovered after the explosion , I looked around me and watched the hell around me , with body parts around him everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that my small boy could not possibly survive that hell .
" I remember that I told him " Damir " run " , but I was also so sure that he had not heard me .
But he has heard it , and he has gone away .
So , unlike many others , life continues for us .
Georgia ’ s Ilyin , 17
The boy , whose terrible image became a symbol of the Greuel von Beslan siege , became the symbol .
To be sure , Georgia ’ s Orange survivor , Georgia ’ s Lyin , with his mother , Fatima after the 2004 siege , is a right-wing image of Georgia today .
His blood-stained face was marked by fear when he burned his life , while Chechen terrorists shot down his classrooms .
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beslan barbarism .
His mother , Fatima , a physician , had removed him for his first day of school , before moving quickly to bring her elderly son , Vladimir to university .
" I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , so my young boy stayed alone for three terrible days , " she reminds .
It was not just a family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
Only my Georgia managed to survive .
As this date approaches , it is harder to think and talk about it .
There is no single day we do not remember this tragedy .
We do not think that it has been a long time since I thought that it had happened yesterday to some scenes of those days .
Nobody ever forgets this , I deny it .
Importantly , the image of Georgia ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack , and was revamped as a statue ( right ) .
I remember that he liked to go to school that day , saying that he wanted to impoverish his teacher .
I knew that he was alive only when I saw him on television .
And now there is even the statue of Georgia ’ s embarrassing defeat in San Marino .
Georgia does not like the picture , and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf .
I understand this , but I also understand that , thanks to this image , people around the world feel our pain .
Georgia today says , " It is important that no such thing can ever happen again .
“ I doubt that we will ever know the truth .
People repeatedly examine such tragedies and never experience the truth .
Now they are examining the plunge of that boeing in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is becoming something horrible .
" I can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , how does no one want a war , so how ?
Ten years are not at all pain .
We need dozens of years to forget it a little .
It has attacked my health , and I still feel it .
For about three or four years , I had a few nightmares of siege , but then it became better .
I went to school again in 2004 , and was afraid every day .
I thought of my friends and classrooms who had been killed .
That is why , when September 1 approaches , I am always entering the sport .
I want to take a toll on my old friends of childhood .
I find it hard to go to the sports room , but I have to do it .
I do not feel victimized ; that story is now part of my past .
I will not forget , but I don ’ t care .
My life continues .
I finished school this year and visited a medical college in Vladikawkaz .
I will become heart surgeon .
My first election was an army training .
I wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not permit it .
I wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
Georgia ’ s Faniyev , 20
The boy who survived , despite being trapped in feet of a murderous terrorist , was a boy .
One wonder : Georgia ’ s Faniyev was trapped in the siege of a murderous terrorist , but managed to survive .
During the siege , he was trapped in sports , sat next to the bomb , which was on the foot of a murderous terrorist .
It is really a wonder that he was not killed .
" We feel as if it had been yesterday , " says Georgia , which , as a intelligence officer , wanted to go to the FSB but could not do so because of its damage from the siege .
It is still me that it is not something I have left behind .
I am older now , and people say that children can easily deal with bad experience – I have to say that is wrong .
“ In 2006 , I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that , but I can not forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - in the year since - was the first and only time I went back into the sports room .
I lost consciousness .
I will never return to you , and do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous image .
Survivors : Georgia ’ s Faniyev today , with a photo of themselves in the hospital following the Laptop siege .
My pain is egregious , and I meet it every day with me .
My friends know that I do not like to think about it or speak about it , and they never asked me about school .
Physically , I do well .
I should be careful about my wounded knees , but I can now do well .
But , because of my health , I could not study the FSB ’ s intelligence agency in Saint Petersburg , as I wanted .
I have made my documents , including medical records , and they have responded that it is not possible .
My second passion was animals , so I went to the animal physician institute .
I have been there for two years .
He learns about treating all animals " from cats to cows . "
“ I knew that I would never report my children my experience .
Children should know nothing about this , and , of course , they should not suffer .
His mother , Marina 42 , said , " This pain never leaves me .
He is worse in my soul , when the anniversary approaches .
I will go to memory .
I know that Georgia will not go away .
He must be much more forceful , because he was there and I don ’ t .
I waited at home and could not help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me , with everyone in Beslan .
It remains in us .
Georgia is now an adult , but that horror is still in him .
It is hard to accept this when something so unfair strikes you .
He is a boy , he likes sports , but he can not participate because of his knees .
He has been operating several times , but can run , not exercise .
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50 % , but you can never overcome it altogether or forget it .
This terrible experience will always follow us .
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege , and that only reinforced my pain .
I lost many people who knew well and who were expensive to me .
My son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that God could do to me , but that my heart wine around the beaten .
I know of families born into new children , but also of widows who never married again .
It is hard to accept that life will continue , even if one does not want that .
I will never forget what my heart was in me when I saw him in the hospital .
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
What are these people fighting for ?
Why do they kill each other ?
The war is now very close to our country , and I can almost believe it .
We used to be a friendly country , how can we be fighting ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine , and that many are killed .
If only we could all pick and throw them around – as far as possible .
Aljona Tskajewa , 10
The Baby , so awakened by a special command , was secured .
Sadly , Aljona Tskajewa is being brought to safety by a Russian Special Operation Commando ( left ) .
It is now ten ( right ) , and it does not recall the cruelties at all .
The world stood its breath in 2004 , when the Baby Aljona was thrown out of the siege in the poor of a Russian policeman .
The terrorists left them out , but in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother , the 10-year-old sister Cristina , and their brother , Machar , held back in school sports .
Makhar , then three years old , was escaped , but Aljona ’ s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage .
Her father , Ruslan , has since married again , and has a small girl with his new wife , Swetlana , who has named him after his lost daughter , Cristina .
Aljona , now a decade old , does not recall the siege and has grown into a smart and happy girl , say neighbors .
“ They are now a great happily family , Aljona , and Makhar are both great children , ” says a close friend .
Ruslan is a phantotic father , and wants to spare all the memories that grow up over the tenth anniversary .
They will understand why .

4 Tipps for Better Water Shotos and Videos
If you want to water photos or videos , there is a choice of equipment .
The cheapest option is a water-intensive pot show , such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 , or an Action Cam like the Goro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both of which have around $ 300 .
I took this photos into a family with multiple cameras , all available at a price below $ 350 .
Regardless of equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
Consider your equipment twice .
Even if you have a water-density camera , you are reassured that the battery cage and other roofs are closed .
Consider your camera in the photos or videos you want to take .
Some cameras and Camcorder have scenes and sewage collections to optimize time for Danish underwater conditions .
And before you leapfrog , consider the depth of your equipment ’ ability to function .
Some cameras are allowed for up to 5 ; others are allowed to 50 or 60 foot .
Look for the traditional and watertight models in our shopping leader and for digital cameras .
Make multiply acquisitions - because many will not climb .
Point-and-cameras have an LCD with which to complicate images usually do not have Action Cams .
Even if you have an LCD , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right imaging station is a good fortune .
So you make many excuses .
When your camera has a travel mode to make a series of images of slightly changed liability hires , you use it .
Down close to the surface .
Light becomes dramatically worse as you continue to move away from the surface .
So , if you are possible , stay on the surface when you make takeovers in a pool , sea , or sea .
This can also bring more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
Consider the objects .
That is a good council to countryside , but it is all the more important in light of bad light .
It is particularly important to work with an Action Cam : these devices often have a solid wildwind ink , which means that you must put your object in thickens if you are to fill the full picture dramas .
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things , even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS .
As an advisory physician , he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the anguish of treatment .
Among his patients , he reminds his wife , was a MI6 staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture .
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and diseases , while the persons are mostly preoccupied with something else : pain .
One day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
" I did not feel , " he wrote in May of this year .
I had trouble upsetting .
As he fought the flash-like symptoms , he observed that he was impatient about his wife .
" I prefer everything more immediately than later , " he said .
When Judge was on a business trip for a week , Lawson felt unusual and without reason .
Something was in the air .
He asked a colleague to investigate his breast X-rays .
Just two weeks ago , he had been sick in the French nightmare .
The result of X-ray examination was X-rays .
He was suffering from Mesotheliom , an incurable cancer that attacked the breast , that is , the lungs of superior skin .
As with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
For example , while smokers have been ill with lung cancer , not all lung cancer have been smokers earlier .
But Mesotheliom is different .
In almost all cases , the trigger is an asset-load contact with the fast-growing commodity , which was once considered a " miracle " that is now considered lethal .
For most of us , Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore .
Asbeis , after all , a product of the past .
The most dangerous asset type was no longer used in Britain since the 1960 ’ s , when industry voluntarily committed to stop using it .
Even where it was still in use , only people in certain industries worked directly on the back burner – plumbers , construction workers , cimmersmen , and advertising workers , for example .
Today , as an industrial commodity from another time , he seems hardly worrisome .
But this complacency is misplaced .
Britain , it seems , is now experiencing the culmination of a Mesolthelioma epidemic .
There are more Mesotheliom deaths here than in any other country in the world .
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year , that disease kills twice as many as traffic accidents .
The annual numbers of Mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom .
The reason that we are now experiencing the deadly effects , though asbestos have been illegal for years ( in 1999 , all the best types of asbeys have been banned ) , is that a Mesotheliom evolved only after decades .
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not confined to former construction workers .
Asbewas , and often remains , present in the houses where we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn , and the shops we buy .
So Mesotheliom does not know class disease , financial boundaries , occupations , or age .
The privileged bastions , from elegant shopping homes in London to private schools , are not room to protect .
Parliament buildings are contaminated .
Even in the hospitals where we are meant to be healthy , this deadly carcinogens have been made to begin .
Andrew Lawson was not old .
Nor was he a plumber .
Indeed , he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos .
Then he discovered .
" There seems to be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy ' s Hospital , where I have completed my education for six years . "
All students - students , nurses , doctors , and pinsecretaries - use the tunnels .
One wonders how many of my associates will suffer from the same disease ?
Unfortunately , he could answer that question , at least in part .
" Of the four doctors trained on the Guy ' s Hospital , who have been sick of Mesotheliom for the last five years , " he wrote in a letter in 2010 , " I 'm the last who still lives . "
How many of us will get sick ?
At Andrew Lawson , Mesotheliom was diagnosed at age 48 .
When he died on February 17 of this year , he was 55 .
That was an extraordinarily long survivor .
Fifty percent of all Mesothelioman disease die within 8 months of diagnosis .
The disease always ends fatally .
So we can only repeat Lawson 's question : " How many of us will be sick ? "
The leading British expert on Mesotheliom , a professor Julian Peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the UK ’ s best epidemic is expected to stall , 90,000 of the disease will be lost .
For the moment , most of them have no idea that they will die .

A brief look at courts ’ files , to which those affected often turn to for compensation requirements , shows how far the scourge of the Mesotheliom is already widespread .
In June of this year , for example , Marks and Spencer admitted that they had been negligently exposed to Janice Allen .
For nine years , she worked for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for clothing department in two locations - one of them the fiefdoms at Oxford Street .
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years away when she started operating at M & S .
Now it has two children in the twenties .
" Before this cause , " she says , " I had never heard of Mesotheliom ; I didn ' t even know anything about asbestos .
I would never have thought that this would have been the case .
Few people know a lot about asbestos .
The fact is that Asbestos does not derive a substance , but a group of six minerals .
The name stems from the word " asform , " a description of the fascist structure that makes the stuff resilient and flexible .
Three of the six were used in the construction industry .
Chrysotle , also known as white asbestos , is by far today ’ s most widely fed asbestos in buildings .
It was used for ventilators , football pills , raw liquids , boills , even for brakes in cars .
It is less lethal than other forms of assimilation , but it is still viewed by the EU and the WTO as a " great health risk " with possible success .
But more dangerous is the brown asbestos ( Amosit ) and the blue asbestom ( Croydolith ) .
Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspected that " there is strong , but indirect , evidence that this was a major reason for the country 's unique high rates of mesothelioma . "
Marks & Spencer ’ s staff was placed on fire store in Oxford Street , London , Asbestos Albey .
Janice Allen may not have regarded herself as typical pesothelioma victims , but Julian Peto ’ s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual .
He has presented a study of those involved showing that " a significant portion of the Mesotheliome without being known by work or at home was probably caused by asbestos in the environment . "
Much of this contact is based on the " normal use and aging " of our buildings .
No one looks likely to be certain .
A report by Goddard Consulting , which studied the palace of Westminster , shows how people , even in the heart of the government , might have been unwittingly disrupted .
In 2009 , Goddard reported that service shops and royalties were contaminated behind Parliament 's assault rooms , whose lethal fascists could be bought up with something as innocuous as " strong as " air movements . "
MPs are often accused of addressing their own interests , but here it looks as if the opposite is true .
While Diet Diet Direction insisted that the West Minster Palace received a " clean health paper , " it is now undeniable that £ 1 billion must be used for several years to renovate Parliament , modernize the electric installations , and remove the asbestos , and that , after the general election in 2015 , legislators are more likely to meet in the nearby QE2 Conventions than in the western Britons .
As the God report also pointed out , " the presence of asbestos was not handled according to their terms . "
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
All we can do now is wait .
One person who could never specify the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott , a general practitioner .
As Andrew Lawson suggests , the 50th year abbott was susceptible to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
“ I worked in a hospital where suits of assay , ” he says , “ but I can not prove them in my case .
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked and the data .
What he remembers is the day early December 2009 , when he was given a kind of fever .
He was 45 , and just abducted an operation .
Suddenly , I had shaken rocks .
It suddenly came .
I felt terrible .
I believed that the drive was no longer going home .
As a doctor , Abbott knew that the pain was drowned by the breast that arose around his running .
But , like Janice Allen , he had no reason to suspect a memotheliom .
He did not go to work a month .
miraculous doctors made x-rays of his breast , using Pleurakathetis to take liquid fluid and test in the laboratory .
But its complaints remained undiagnosed .
Its health was slowly improving , and it returned to the workplace .
From time to time , however , symptoms returned , often after sporting activity and heavy breathing space .
In 2011 , a patient had similar symptoms of symptoms and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom .
But , again , Abbott did not associate this with his own case .
After all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
The connection in this case was clear .
In September 2011 , Abbott ’ s state deteriorated again , and his house physician turned CTSans and X-rays into a group of experts .
In December 2011 , just two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time , a camera-equipped Sunnis were introduced to the heights of the river between the river and the breast .
I am an optimist .
I mostly keep saying , " he says .
Frankly , I had not worried so much at all .
But Rachel , my wife , was worried .
The result of the biopsy was a new year between Christmas and New Year : " They told me that it was Mesotheliom . "
Graham Abbott : Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly , Abbott Termine had Macmillan nurses , one of whom recommended taking a lawyer from him .
Only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic .
“ It turns out that asbestos were widespread , especially in large public buildings where plumbing was often isolated with asbestos , ” he says .
The people exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are suffering .
As a result , Mesotheliom is now meeting younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
The most dangerous plumbing with assurances in hospitals was below the earth , so patients were probably not obliged .
But many staff who moved from one building to another ( such as Andrew Lawson ) or in underground canals ( as Graham Abbott often did ) came into contact with toxic substances .
It turns out that , for several decades after the war , hospitals may have been a life-saving household , but life-threatening , for physicians .
It remains a distant prospect today .
Students turned their tunnels to asbeds .
And it is not just hospitals .
Asbestos was often used in offices , stores , libraries , and urban areas , owing to its flimsy isolated and flattening properties .
Schools , too , are schools .
Indeed , many people probably had the first assault act in the classroom .
Across the country , in thousands of chemicals , students have turned their tunnels on assault burners .
Websites frequently address the issue of asbestos in schools .
Meanwhile , our homes have contained such innocent items as soccer slopes or sloppers as standard asbestos .
“ It is an industrial poison contained in much of our real estate , ” Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his Guy ' s hospital trial .
In one case , the only contact that invaded a woman was the demolition of a garden-building in the 1970 ’ s .
So let ’ s adjust how you turn your garden forces down .
The impact of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
“ It takes a while to process , ” Graham Abbott says .
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I noted that I could not focus on what I did .
I was in practice for two weeks .
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself .
Well , I will not see any more Christmas firmly .
The greatest difficulty was the shift from a doctor ’ s position to that of a patient .
Like countless patients before him , he reminds himself of how overwhelmed he was of all the information with which he was right .
“ It was very difficult to absorb all of this , ” he says .
" I asked my doctor " how long I have ? "
And I was told about 12 months .
I remember I thought that " Na yes , " I will not see any more Christmas .
" That was it . "
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious , because it is our life-support mechanism - ie , breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer .
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos .
Asbestos consists of smallest fathers .
When the asbestos are bypassed and the fascists illiterated , they can become entrenched in the brown , surrounding skin .
Assistants irritate the breast , and can cause cell mutations .
" The problem arises from the inhalized nadelmal assistants , " said Professor Tom Treasure , a cardiovascular doctor who changed the guy ' s hospital in 2001 .
Ironically , the very hospital that Andrew Lawson suggests has exposed him to asbestos is now a leading center in treating Mesotheliom .
Treasury secretaries knew Lawson , and treated a few others who were also probably exposed to asbestos during their education in the hospital .
Once the best advertisements reach pneumonia , treasuries say , " they are marginalized from the respiratory process , where the skin is the skin .
It is invasive from the outset .
The usual options for other cancers do not work well for Mesotheliom .
The efficacy of an operation , for example , is hotly contentious .
Some argue that it is worth trying .
Treasuries agree .
“ You can ’ t read the brother , ” he says .
They are not around the knife .
Meanwhile , “ cancer ” does not apply well to chemotherapy , which " shows " but does not heal .
“ Sometimes there are long-term survivors , ” Treasuries say .
But , in the end , they all die .
Fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis , Graham Abbott is still fighting .
After contacting Mesotheliom , Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson , who had become a one-man support and consultancy office four years after his diagnosis .
" Hallo , Cancer 's center , " he was cheerful about appeals .
" He was very positive , " says Abbott .
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier , and was still very active .
Initially , Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that took four months to prolong his life by only a month .
" I was desperate , " he says .
I wanted to give up .
But Lawson managed " to make things look more positive in a somewhat more positive light . "
Following the advice of several doctors , Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lazdunski , the heartbeat specialist , on Guy .
" We had an advantage by not having to be relegated , I simply called , and received a date " admits Graham . "
A normal patient would have to be transferred and await treatment approval .
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom ’ s sufferers to understand the best treatments available .
But when these treatments inevitably fail , many of those affected by another financial concern – about the future of families left behind .
So they turn to the courts in hope of compensation .
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LP .
“ It has been known since 1898 that asbestos are extremely dangerous to health , ” Morgan says .
But what changed in the 1960 ’ s was that it recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk .
And here , companies ’ negligence began to play a role .
Andrew Lawson and Guy ' s Hospital finally brought about their case , but it was not what Morgan calls " complete compensation , " because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an assisted contact to the guy .
After investigating his death , however , a Speaker of the Guy confirmed that " the most fascists in the affected area were removed in the 1990 's . "
That was too late for Andrew Lawson .
How to Eliminate Asbestos
Indeed , it is a huge problem for Mesotheliom sufferers , who seek compensation , to attribute the deadly asset-taking of a firm or a job – usually decades after the incidents .
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
Insurance claims can be lost .
And those who resist claims know that the time is time for them , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
In response , there have been clear new legislation earlier this year that makes it easier for Mesotheliom ’ s sufferers to sue compensation , even if their former employers can no longer be found .
The law has established a £ 350 million ( $ 350 million ) insurance fund for all whom were diagnosed after July 2012 , but can not show contact , but can not sue anyone .
In these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court could have called in a normal compensation process – about $ 120,000 .
Some 300 successful applications for the program are expected to be around a year .
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom sufferers that £ 350 million was a " very good job " for the insurance industry .
" This is a deal of insurers , " he says , " and suggests that this amount is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if time had not gone away , and that Mesothelioma sufferers could have found and sued them normally .
Mike Penning , then Labor and pension ministers , also admitted that the law was " imperfect . "
But both retirement and Morgan admitted that with seven deaths per day , speedy action is needed .
" People suffer so much and need help today , " said Penning during the second hearing of last year 's Mesothelioma Act .
At that point , Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lazdunski for 19 months .
After its first deliberations , long-term Lazdunski recommended an operation that , unlike Tom Treasuries , he expected to have a positive impact .
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy , which allows long-term Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 % for five years .
Abbott felt stronger .
" This is the most important , of course , " says Abbott .
This is always seen in patients .
There is something to let you continue .
If you break down , you will soon be worse off .
Graham Abbott subjected to surgery in March 2012 .
By late August , he had undergone the last of the six chemotherapy cycles .
Politburo health workers showed no sign of the disease .
Then I had a scan in March 2014 .
There were several cancer spots about my breast .
I just got 50 .
This is not life-threatening .
That is livelihoods .
Again , Abbott subjected six chemotherapy cycles .
Now it is no longer a trace of tumors .
But the process is physically and psychologically demanding .
You need to think about practical things - say , the money I don ' t have , or my wife shows how the Boiltime hiring works .
If you get bad news , you will get negative .
They must look forward .
As a father of Ellie , 16 , and Tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
" It 's hard for parents , " he says .
It is hard to know what to say , and how much .
When I received my first diagnosis , I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old .
They responded differently .
Tamsin is very healthy and ruthless .
She told her friends , and we soon received very many calls .
Ellie was more restrained .
She didn ’ t say much .
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must endure .
But , for Mesotheliomdiseases , such talks are not riddled with hope , not a trace of hope for survival .
The disease ( just as it finally did for Stephen Jay Gould ) brings grim security .
As Andrew Morgan says , “ Mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

China refuses Hong Kong ’ s Right to Government Choice ; demonstrators retaliate
On Sunday , despite increasing calls for democratic reform , China ’ s parliament voted against nominating candidates for the 2017 elections by Hong Kong ’ s electorate .
This is likely to fuel the long-heralded protests in Hong Kong ’ s business district , while activists instructed and mobilized to do so within a few hours of declaration .
The ruling by the People ’ s Congress allows Chinese Communist leaders to reject all non-peers .
" This is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , " said the leader of the Democratic Party , Emily Lau .
That is not what Beijing had promised .
Hong Kong 's inhabitants were praised .
And it is clear that there is an authoritarian regime .
In defending China ’ s decision , Li Fei , Deputy Secretary of the People ’ s Congress ’ s Standing Committee , said that permitting public nominations to vote for Hong Kong ’ s government was too “ chaotic . ”
Since 1997 , when Britain returned control of Hong Kong ’ s Chinese , Beijing has pledged to let the inhabitants choose the presidency from 2017 onward .
China ’ s leaders presented Sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because Hong Kong ’ s citizens have a direct suffrage , but the decision also made clear that China ’ s leaders remain firmly in the hands of a Beijing nominating committee .
Moreover , according to a new clause , only candidates " with love of the country and love of Hong Kong " should be allowed .
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong ’ s largest and most popular protests have been held in many years .
Behind Hong Kong ’ s pro-democracy campaign is Occupy Central Love and Peace movement , whose organizers threatened to insulate the financial district if Beijing does not allow real universal suffrage .
On Sunday 's night , within a few hours of the announcement , hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in rain before Hong Kong 's ruling headquarters .
At the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civilian disobedience and planned waves of protest in the coming weeks .
But they did not do so much in order to apparently avoid problems with the authorities .
In an online message , the organizers said that " the movement " considered occupying the central district only as a last resort , a move intended to take place only when all chances of dialogue are exhausted and no other choice .
We are tired of saying that all chances of dialogue have now been exhausted , and that the occupation of the central district will take place definitively .
Hong Kong ’ s authorities have been preparing for Beijing ’ s announcement for days , and security measures , including police and barricades , were strengthened on Sunday before government buildings .
The unrest is aggravated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
The movement of people from the mainland intensifies competition for products and services .
Moreover , there is a growing fear that Hong Kong ’ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing .
Some criticized the Occupy Central demonstrations as they threatened business operations - Hong Kong 's lifeline .
" The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage , depending on how many of them are involved and how long they last , " said legal experts Regine Ip , who has long criticized the movement .
We don ’ t want to stoke fears that Hong Kong is running out of control .
That impression is bad for investment .
China ’ s state-controlled media also recently reported Hong Kong ’ s pro-democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an informal referendum on the voting rights of 780,000 people – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong ’ s voters .
In July , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
The tradition of schooling in the US is now transferred to universities , where friendships are offered with private aircraft .
We are pleased to respond to this demand , offering the UK ’ s first luxurious travel service to students today .
To achieve a particularly impressive university performance , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , Rolls-Royce Phantom , Aston Martes , or McLare P1 .
Mr. Stewart also said that the service had a security saving .
This service is an ideal alternative for students , who would have to pocket their habits in a dangerously overloaded car .
Together with our new VIF options , we are pleased to ensure this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury .
A business spokesperson said that no new accounts were made , because the service had just been introduced , but added that " students would pay the service for the next few weeks . "
The company also said that , despite tuition fees of $ 9,000 a year , it expected a market for the supply .
Students today are very different from students ’ expectations and demands 10 , 20 , 30 , or 40 years ago - more important than ever , making a great first impression , and VIF can do just that .
The National Student Union , however , criticized the service as being withdrawn .
Megan Dunn , NUS Vice President for Higher Education , said : " This offer seems totally separated from the lives of the majority of students .
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis in living costs , since available financial support , in the form of credit and scholarships , does not keep pace with soaring bills for the easiest livelihoods before they can think of spending thousands of pounds just one-fold as they arrive in university homes .
Feminists criticize race and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson , Moon .
Participants raised their hands and sang " high , not shooting , " while waiting before the funeral .
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson , Mo , over the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown , blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discourse of white feminists .
According to their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before the race to address reproductive law and income inequality .
But , while tensions rose in the Middle East and received attention across the country , Perez saw white women ’ s answers revolving around 100 % .
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the students of August 9 , personal essays came with titles like “ Thinking about Ferguson of a white woman , ” and “ feminism is not just about oppression of women . ”
But for Perez , this represented an important shift .
“ I don ’ t believe that feminism finds many people who are white and speak privilege in such high-class ways , ” she said .
People felt compelled to express what happened .
It is emblematic of the crisis we are in , and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they must express it .
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University , Ferguson exposed problems that black American women face every day , but that are not considered " women 's issues " in the cultural sphere .
“ I can publish some amusement on Facebook about me and my partner , and get 150 lists from anywhere , ” Mitchell said .
When I insist on how Farbige is under siege in her own country , the silence is deafening .
“ How can women be sure to speak publicly about a relationship , but not about security in the public sphere ? ” she asked ?
There is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems for black women , such as Mitchell , who have studied race , gender , and sexuality in US history .
For them , black women did not have the luxury of cleaning up issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
While white women now connect race and gender issues in mainstream feminist circles , Angela Hattery , a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University , says that their predecessors did the opposite .
“ Between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were managed , and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , ” said Hattery .
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchmurder .
Hattery saw the rift between whites and black women at the point of analyzing white women ’ s voting rights , such as Susan B. Anthony , and noting that fighting for the right to vote could succeed only one group : women or blacks .
“ They made a choice to advocate women ’ s voting rights , and the suffrage of blacks should come later , ” Hattery said .
When one recalls such things , one becomes aware of the power to understand why white women do not trust them .
We have not done our job well .
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons .
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade to organize white women against the Lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching .
Nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women , Mitchell says .
For Mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists played " with the problems faced by black women for generations .
“ Wouldn ’ t it be tolerable if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to control recipient ? ” Mitchell asked .
Second generation feminists who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception now try to understand what that means .
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Stein went on Facebook two weeks after the shootings of Michael Brown , publishing a scripted article by Rebecca Carroll , columnist of the Guardian , calling for more protests from white Americans on racism .
" I hope that women with another , but parallel , reason for understanding an inherent danger to the body -- and for opinions about the race that are very different in public surveys -- will lead the changes . "
Although stones represent a rather intersectarian feminism where racial and gender issues are addressed , some of their comments on race in America are puzzled .
Christina Summers , researchers at the American Enterprise Institute and author of “ Who Stole Feminism ? ” she said to The People that young men in the United States , especially young non-white men , are “ far more vulnerable than their sisters , ” but Steinem 's remarks about Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism .
There are now hundreds of specific programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently introduced a small program , My Brother ' s Keeper , to help vulnerable black and Hispanic men , there were angry reactions from many feminists , including Gloria Stein .
The police relationship with the black community is not the only problem that mainstream feminism is pressing to the fore .
After nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minutes on the country 's southwest border this year , the immigration reform issue is back to the surface - this time as a women 's issue .
Andrea Mercado , Co-Chairman of us Belong Together , an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform , said that she had to publish only immigration women ’ s stories for reviewing the issue as a major issue .
" They speak for themselves , " Mercado said .
When the vast majority of labor visas go to male immigrants , the women they accompany are in a position to be vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
" These stories resonate with women 's organizations , " she said .
“ Pig Home ” in Ipswich
The image of a house selling was removed from real-estate brokers when it became clear that it had picked up a large pig of it in the living room .
The vacant house has a bedroom , is on a private street in Ipswich , and is offered for £ 120,000 .
Among the details was a demolition of the home room of the house -- including a pig that had beamed his head on a sofa .
Housing maker Connell has said that the pig is the owner ’ s boy .
" The photo , however , was misleadingly published , and has since been removed , " said one of the company 's spokesperson .
In the exile of the House , Connell described the former assembly construction as a “ unique single family with a bedroom . ”
Although the broker has removed the picture from the Web site , it still appears on advertising material .
Housing sales gave rise to social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .
The SWF City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire by Lower Winning
A Harvey loopholder is this month ’ s Origin
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth , with a happy winner receiving nearly $ 1.1 million from the Saturday loophole .
A Harvey newspaper kiosk drew the jackpot for the second time in five years , following $ 1 million in November 2009 .
But the happy winner has yet to register .
Steve Forward , the storeowner , said that the profits of pollutants in the small town in the southwest of Perth .
The city talks about nothing else , and everyone is rather outspoken .
We thought that such a gain could occur .
Eight WMA winners celebrated gains in the first division last month , a fee degree for a few weeks for state players .
Last week , a Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires in August , after a couple of people in Belmont gained a mega-win of $ 7.5 million just a few weeks earlier .
The victor person had played and said for twenty years that the benefits allow them to travel around the world and buy a new house .
Harvard ’ s millionaire is the 59th winner of the first vision in the WEA this year , totaling nearly $ 85 million .
Leonida asked the Gladiatorenena
Not only did Gladiatorians sit in the game during the first Rhine Rome Day in leisure park .
But the event ’ s attraction was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday , who defy the rainforests and cold-scale cold , and were enthusiastic about historical spectacles .
There were a bunch of depictions , shows , games , exhibitions , and information about the days of Romans and their meaning for the Rhineland .
The day 's main attraction was undoubtedly the Martian combat force of the Gladiatoran " Amor Mortis " school , which used every respite to demonstrate its robust combat arena with soft sand .
Gladiatorenians " Leonida " proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter into each other 's heroic dual struggle in various Gladiatoran attacks .
First , " provocators " were short on the line with legal ships and short-term sword , as well as legacies on the left and on the right .
It was followed by " Essedarii , " with breast shipts , short-term sword , and worm flanks , and iron gladiatorenhelm , legs , and arms protection .
The appearance of " Retiarius , " which ran against the " Secutor " with worm , tributor , and dolch after a recent fight , was particularly impressive .
There , the heavy metallic growers scraped each other , packaged fts , and the root farms fled the arena for fear and belong to Gladiatorium ’ s health .
But the monumental " Summa Rudis , " the muscular refereeing judge , had an ever-attentive eye .
" We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of Roman times viable , " declared Lorence Euskirch , Chairman of the event " Freedom Canal , " the intensity behind the spectacle .
After two years of preparation , an “ opium of Romanum , ” a Roman city , as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage observed in his grasp , became an “ Oppium Romanum for a day . ”
After all , Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region , but also Roman culture and numerous structures that we still admire today .
Residual survivors were also the best of Roman Day , such as “ Aquacduke Marmor , ” of the 11-meter high and 1,400 kilometers long Römerkanal bridge that was once a lip of lies .
The frontline society once and now confronted water and energy supplies , and CEO Petra Fricke knew : " We still derive benefits from the knowledge of those then . "
This confirms diplomat measurement engineers Ralph Heiger of the " Engineering Task " of Rhine , who unveiled measurement tools of Romans such as Chorobat , Groma , and Dioptra .
The Römervilla in Blankheim presented skickards and models of the explosions Anno in 1894 , as well as brick stones from the Original mortgage , the warm-up heating that once warmed Rome villa .
Also impressive were footprints left to the tone by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago before they were burned .
In 2011 , the National Association of Rhineland post had buried the remains of Roman villa in commercial park Nord in Rheinbach .
They found redrafting walls of an economy building with a Darre to dry grain and cold .
Building probably included a Villa Rustica , an agricultural commodity , the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morsel explained .
A number of holes from these congestions presented them in a glass vitrine , including a large plastic , several fine bottlenecks , and parts of a zier chain .
The Villa had arguably existed from the first to fourth centuries after Christianity until the arrival of Germanen in the then Roman Rhineland , suspects morning .
The children also looked at Roman windmills , similar to today ’ s refrigerators , or wrote , as Roman students once , their names with metal flying on yellow .
At the level of Rome thermal Zulpich , children could use mosaiks themselves , at the level of the glass museum of Rhine glass mosaic , and at the level of the natural center , use a heavy wheat of stones to chase the seeds for a bottling broke or a garbage .
The Roman rice fathers built up by two cold-blooded trucks also kept visitors through the leisure park , overcoming the impressive location of the city ’ s glamnasium , which presented the results of their “ Rome Project weeks . ”
With a firestorm week on September 13-21 , the community will enter the Rhineland year 2014 to recall the deaths of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago .
Along with home and history clubs , as well as with the wake-up clubs , the partnerships , and the layman ’ s circle of colonels , mathematical migrations are offered , a lecture , cooking department , and school classrooms leaders , and reminders of the Roman past of Wachberg .
In this case , for example , Roman legions are told by his work on the promised guard , presenting crops as living nostrums of the Roman era , and providing a ludicrous lesson in international understanding between a group of wake-up " Germanen " and admitted Romans .
The Adenvillage primary school is devoted to the Roman issue during a project week .
With the Roman week , the numerous , but often no longer at first sight sight , traces of the Romans at Wachberg are being regained .
In the guard camp Rathau , a small presentation is reminiscent of the Berator ’ s Matronenshirt-Holy Fund in 1879 .
Ebola : The Epidemic Burdens West Africa ’ s Economy
West Africa ’ s Ebola epidemic is also a serious blow to the economy .
Markets are orphaned – and international companies distance themselves .
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealt a serious blow to West Africa ’ s economy .
The crops are depleted to fields , the mines are abandoned , and the markets are orphaned – the virus has made the region hard .
Some international companies , too , are already at a distance .
" The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , " judged by the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kaberuka .
The Hardest hit for Liberia
" It is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , " says Alhaji Bamogo , who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia 's capital , Monrovia Kclothing .
The market has only seen who wants to buy food or something to destroy Ebola .
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , with more than 600 victims of fever alone .
Recently , health officials declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country .
In Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Nigeria , too , the virus has spread .
Overall , more than 1,500 people have died , and thousands more have died .
Withdrawal of Foreign Business
Everywhere in resource-rich countries , firms are running their operations .
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flooding the affected regions .
Likewise , domestic traders and farmers respond : few merchants leave their homes to worry about supplies .
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia , quarantine areas , including the export of key cococoa and coffee crops , is rolling in the fields .
Farmers dare not want to leave their homes for harvest .
Food Skills
" People will travel less and less , " Phillipe De Vreyer says , Paris experts on West Africa 's economy .
For example , the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables is preferable to stay home .
So the population is directly and urgently affected by the epidemic : food is scarce .
In markets , the supply of staple foods such as rice is waning .
At the same time , the region heavily dependent on international firms is threatening a reputational damage – with far-reaching consequences .
The greatest danger is that international companies will essentially shun the area for a long time , says Filipink Hugon of French think tank Iris .
The key is how far and how long the virus will spread .
Investors may feel that " it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone , and Liberia , and thus to invest , " Hugon warns .
The disease also strains states ’ budget strains
The disease also strains the countries ’ already-strained budgets .
The credit rating agency Moody ’ s fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by high health-care spending and further tightened by the deteriorating economy .
The African Development Bank has already pledged to help health systems in the affected countries of $ 60 million ( $ 45 million ) .
The effects are apparent in Nigeria , where few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far .
Yes , the oil-rich region in southern Niger Delta is not yet affected .
But many people elsewhere remain , fearful of contagion at home .
Reserves in hotels are also falling sharply .
Protections celebrate their 50th anniversary .
Purchases of " tannenwald " Berngau celebrates his 50-year founding line from 12 to 14 .
High tours are the preparations for the 50-year founding stick of September 12-14 .
The plan is on September 12 th , a major entertainment with the " Dorfrocker " group .
On Saturday , the big bad will shoot at 18 p.m.
Then there is the crowd casting of the vote with the " Stoapmature Spitzbuzam . "
The Music Blash
Batons on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 a.m. in the arrhage and the Great Leap Forward at 14 p.m.
On afternoon , too , the price distribution of the federal and Gauck shoots is the same .
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festivities with their throne .
The firebrand captain is Berngau .
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Schwarracker have taken over .
The original term " Protection Society Tannenwald Berngau " originated in 1907 , when the club was founded on March 21 for " social entertainment through the cigarette shootings . "
The NS regime caused the United Nations to disintegrate in 1937 .
Only in 1964 did 19 young men who , on April 30 , raised the " new " cannum forest " of Berngau gas in Luca .
Karl March and Adolf Ried cited the club as the champion of a difficult initial period , mainly about finding a location and installing shale operations .
Back in the autumn of 1965 , the pollutant club started in the gas thouse " Leininger " with two teams of rodents .
In subsequent years , sports protection , now organized in seven teams , grew in all classes , all the way to the 1 th Gauliga .
The United Nations record peddled , and the 380 accomplishments were achieved for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier .
Just as the capability of active proteins has increased , so , too , has membership numbers performed well .
After the United Nations Communication " Leininger " no longer satisfied the demands of a modern umbrella , the then CEO , led by Johan Rinn , has chosen to create a future state of affairs in the wastes of the new " land thouse of hardship . "
Following a job of 2700 hours on May 8 , 1988 , Pfarrer Strasses gave the cornerstone blessing to new polluters .
One of the great realities of United Nations history was certainly the 44th Gauck ’ s shooting , coupled with the solemn nature of the new protégé flag in July 1991 .
On April 23 and 24 , 1994 , the polluter club celebrated its 30-year anniversary .
In 1995 , a non-tariff group was created .
Joseph Schmalzl became a bad referent .
A major challenge to the " bad guys " and the overall club was to follow Bavarian bad luster in 2005 .
In many hours of honorable work , the United Nations modernized the rooms and shale facilities in Berngauer Hof last year , bringing them to the latest level of the technology .
Eleven Teams in Rundensity Fights
Suspending can also be given the sports of the umbrella union .
Overall , 11 teams currently participate in the race race fight : six Air Defense teams , an airborne proud team , one sports proud KK1 , a youth and two AHR teams .
The 1 . The team with Lar Ellrich , Katharina Ellrich , Steffi degrees , and Kerstin Kellermann rose to the town of 1 in the 2013 / 14 from the Gaullia ( the highest league in the guards of the guards of the guards , ANB ) .
The 2nd team with Verena Mosburger Alexandra Meier , Eva Schuhmann , and Tobias Graml has moved from the Gauliga Nord to the Gaullian upper League .
Beyond sports , events such as bockchains , fashing and royal football , United Statement , and Christmas celebration have a tradition .
In the process , the walls are also in the feasts of Pfarrei and Community .
Tony Stewart is suffering an accident in return to the Renewals
Tony Stewart ’ s return to the race , for example , ended halfway through his race on the Atlantic Motor Speedway .
Stewart ran against the Wall for the second time , after his rightful predecessor burst in Round 172 and ended its evening .
Stewart kept his damaged car in check , leaving it without speaking to journalists .
His team , Chad Johnston , said that his 14-member team was disappointed , but is now focused on the race in Jumond , Virginia , next weekend .
“ I wish we had better use and a better outcome for him , ” Johnston said .
We travel to Jumond , hoping that we can do better there .
Stewart was already entering a wall in Sunday ’ s race , following a collision with Kyle busch , and had to repair the right side of his folly .
“ I ’ ve reached out today with reasonably good hopes for a good outcome , ” said Johnston , adding : “ It ’ s simply not there . ”
Not long after the second accident , Stewart ’ s car was invited to the screeching room , and the team had packed and was ready to abate .
Stewart allowed three NASCAR Sprint Cup to be running after his car hit and killed another driver in an eight-rail race in New York ’ s north .
He decided to return this week , either in Atlanta or in the next race , to gain a place in the persecution process .
He returned to his job during an inquiry into the tragic incident that led to the death of Kevin Jr. , a 20-year-old Kevin Jr. , who had embarked on the way during a race to confront Stewart .
The authorities said on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks .
There has not been a choice yet about whether steady must face charges .
The triple champion was received with great applause when presented before the race .
Start with a 12th position , Stewart entered the first tenth place shortly thereafter , and was temporarily ranked fourth .
After a New Round of 122 , Buschy
Wagging with the Nr , 18 out of control after the exit from Kurve 2 , collided with Stewart , with both cars running against the Wall .
Stewart continued , but fell to 21st place .

Simply put , Laura , Lena , Lisa , Marie , Bettina , Emma , and Left Director Lisa Neitzel look forward to competitors .
Like many other clubs , the jazz groups on TV must create annual education for secondary schools .
After the summer vacations , some groups have decimated sharply .
Young people are now looking for a sport that is healthy and enjoys great fun .
In the two jazz and modernity groups of Lisa Neitzel , formerly Jazz and Modern Dance Formation members , only nine children are children .

" We 're also eating , guessing tanks , and we have already overhauled ourselves in tanks , " says Lisa Neitzel .
One can build friendships in the group , share a beautiful hobby , and do much for one ’ s own motor development .
Whoever is not so because of whom Jaztleness , one of the other offerings of TV , can sneak into the nuclei year .
Children and teenagers can always enter the classroom for childhood / jaztleness , bamino ballet , video clip-dancing , and hip-hop into classroom .

Demand Bulgaria ’ s Prison
Hundreds of Bulgaria prison workers across the country organized a nationwide protest before the justice ministry in the capital , Sofia .
In peaceful demonstration , they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions , which were recently changed .
Higher salaries are also on the list of forests to be discussed with Hristo Ivanov , the interim justice minister .
Officials have protested symbolically against the new working hours for a month , and are demanding a return to the earlier 24-hour classes .
Despite the summit between the prison and justice ministry officials , no deal was reached , the national Bulgarian Ratio ( BNR ) reported .
The negotiations lasted , Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR to carry out punitive action .
Protest of prison workers is likely to be supported by members of the Internal Ministry ’ s union .
Ukraine ’ s Army abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine , pro-Russian fighters remain on the march .
Today , after serious battles , allegedly involving Russian tank battalions , Ukraine ’ s army , Monday , abandoned the rebel Luhansk airport .
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn human consequences from his army ’ s serious defeat in the fight against separatists , and announced that change in the top army leadership would be without detail .
Prorussian separatists Shot Airplanes
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces , pro-Russian separatists have , by their own account , shot down a warplane and two military helicopters .
Moreover , roughly 100 soldiers were injured or killed in fighting in the Donbas region , according to the insurgents , on Monday , split up Russian agencies .
Losing Coast Guard Shield
The insurgents also claimed to have cut off two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Alevi Sea .
Ukraine ’ s border protection confirmed that two of its ships had been fired near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday .
Seven border guards had been injured , one Speaker in Kyiv said to the station 112 th .
Two occupation members were considered missing .
Local media blamed Russia for the incident .
The separatists also reported controlling multiple Donetsk neighborhoods .
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Belarus ’ s capital , Minsk , now meets the Ukrainian contact group .
Along with representatives of Ukraine , Russia , and the OSCE , an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should participate .
In advance , all actors used their public disclosures to make their case .
NATO Don ’ t Cry agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis .
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO abided by the founding of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council .
But NATO 's leader accused Russia of " a gross break " of the agreement .
“ Today , we must face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner , ” Rasmussen says .
documents and statements from Russia 's side show that " they regard us as adversaries . "
A Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to enhance NATO ’ s presence in Eastern Europe .
A " Readiness Action Plan " adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that " we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary , " Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels .
Kiev and Moscow agree on New Gas Talks
Russia and Ukraine have , according to official statements , agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute .
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday , said Russian Energy Secretary Alexander Nowak on Monday .
It is still awaiting a European Union decision whether to send a representative to the talks .
Ukraine has been shut out of Russia for weeks by dispute over gas prices .
Last but not least , the EU Energy Commission Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides .
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies for Europe .
Europe receives roughly one-third of its gas from Russian sources , much of which goes through Ukraine .
Merkel talks a powerful word : watching will be " clear . "
Now the chancellor is clearly committed again .
But it is not a letter of freedom for all of the complicated details .
Stubbornly worried about the CDU about the Pew watchdog have awakened the CSU .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for introducing a Pew watchdog , after persistent resistance from her CDU .
" To put it bluntly , she is in the coalition agreement , and she will come , " Party Chair said on Monday after meetings of the CDU 's in Berlin .
But , for now , Merkel has not been committed to a detailed model .
Black - Red Government program calls " certain parameters . "
German Foreign Minister Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) has " made a proposal , and that is now being continued . "
The NRW CDU , however , insists on its No vote to watch everyone on the street .
Merkel emphasized that German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) , too , is making constructive instructions for a bill .
Beyond the issue , he has also talked about further ways to activate more private capital for infrastructure investment , including broadband expansion .
" There is nothing special about it , " Schäuble had left a " mirror " report on Sunday , his house is considering its own concept for compensating highway investors with tolls revenues after the 2017 election .
Horst Seehofer , the CSU ’ s leader , then warned against developing cabinet authors against the chief minister .
CDU-vize Armin Lashet reinforced his objections .
“ The coalition treaty never assumed that it would reinforce all roads and cities , ” the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU chair said .
As a result , it is an important signal that seehofs have now announced that they are talking about the issue again .
Opposition to the plans comes from the Baath worm and Rheinland PFalz CDU associations as well .
The fear is that watching affects small movement of borders with neighboring states .
Seen trips had demanded coalition orthodoxy for opposing the authors of the Christian Democrats .
The left views plans as failing in the face of the Union ’ s dispute .
" The Morsi watch is dead , " Party leader Bernd Riexinger said the " New Osnabmad newspaper " ( Monday ) .
" The minister fails , " and Dobrindt wants to introduce a cigarette service on all German roads to start in 2016 .
But , according to the Coalition Treaty , domestic car owners must not be allowed to suffer additional damage .
So , through the Kfzi tax , they are supposed to be fully compensated .
But the model must not discriminate foreign drivers , under EU law , for their nationality .
Genetic Disorder Often Misdiagnoses
One British says they thought for many years to die as a consequence of a misdiagnosis .
Karin Rodger almost all of her youth were living in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease .
Indeed , it suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth ( CMT ) disease – a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and backward limits .
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT , because so little is known about it .
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom probably suffer from CMT , which can lead to motor disturbances such as muscle weakness , an uncertain and tired drain .
The disease is incurable and proliferated , which means that the symptoms get worse over time .
When Rodgers was 13 , she thought she was suffering from Friedrich Ataxy ( FA ) - a disease with very poor prospects for survival .
Rodger thought she would be in a roles before she would be 18 and die before her 30th birthday .
The mother of two children who is now 51 years old said , “ As a child I knew I could not do the same as the others .
I consistently fell backward , and it took longer for me .
I could never travel with the other children rolls or skatbots , and I have often been walked out for my way and run for school .
Rodgers said that , by 13 years old , she was watching her medical records at age , after several operations to deplete her Achilles ’ forestation , and that her physician had left the room , reading that she was suffering from FA .
“ I felt guilty of being curious , so I told anyone , but I searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society , ” she said .
When I was answered , I was shocked and feared panic .
I thought that I would be in a roles with 18 and die with 25 , and that everyone would lose all of my skills in the interim .
I singled out all this with me , planning my own funeral .
She told her when she became 17 , it became clear to her that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor .
He simply stood up and said , " I think my love , I don ' t think you will , lest you keep warm now in the roles . "
I think you hail something far less life-threatening .
After some genetic tests , the CMT found it .
“ When he explained to me what CMT was , I felt as if I was a whiner , ” she said .
Charity CMT has launched a CMT-awareness-month to inspire attention to the disease .
Staff levers , including D. Berni Diether , have worked since the former troop service was shut down .
For nearly a decade , the former Munisin troop exercise has not been shot up .
Nevertheless , mortal ammunition takes place every month at the heart of the biosphere area , weakening Alb .
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they must be burned on the ground .
A deafening belt resonates with the explosions about the heart of the biosphere area .
In December 2004 , the last sharp shot was in Munisings , the Munich Square Force Square , which was shut down after 110 years of military operations in late 2005 .
Since then , 6500 hectares of great astronomies have been the heart of the biosphere area of Alb , which is opened to 13 paths for Wars and cyclists .
The Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington Area is rising with the Economic Recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales , and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
Government and local fiscal moderation for domestic companies rose slightly over the past year , while economic recovery accelerated , says a newly published study last week , and businesses in Washington were no exception .
District companies , Maryland , and Virginia all paid $ 27.6 billion in government and local fiscal year in 2013 , a 3.8 % increase over the 2012 revenue of $ 26.6 billion .
The corporate and local tax burden rose from 4.3 % last year to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 % in the previous year , and it was the third year of growth , following several years of decline , in 2009 and 2010 .
Government taxes rose more than local taxes by 4.3 % , according to the study conducted by the Services Agency Ernst & Young , a tax group at the center of government taxation .
More than half of the District ’ s tax revenue , 56 % , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 % of Maryland ’ s income comes from companies .
Virginia gets the lowest tax revenue from companies , at 28 % .
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate real estate values , as researchers say , resulting in a 3.7 % increase in property taxes this year with a growth rate of less than 1 % following three consecutive years .
While much of these gains came from large states , such as California , New York , and Texas , the process also seems to be true in Washington .
District , Maryland , and Virginia companies collectively paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 % increase over the course of a year .
But the seeming rebound in real estate values is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenues in Maryland , because property taxes amount to just over one-fifth of the rate of corporate taxation .
Virginia and DC companies pay almost half their government and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
“ In Maryland , this is what happens : much of the real estate , especially in the tax area around D. C. , is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no real estate taxes , ” said Douglas Lindholm , CEO of the Center on State Taxation .
Maryland , for example , is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other governments provide .
The recent corporate recovery in tax revenues can not be expected only for the recovery of the housing market .
Corporate income , the data suggest , also seems to be recovering .
Companies in the region reported $ 2.3 billion in income taxes for state agencies , compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Maryland collected $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
As the trend goes in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses does not grow evenly in all three places .
The rate of increase in the District was 4.3 % national average , while the increase in Maryland was much higher , was 4.9 % .
Only Virginia reported an subpar tax increase of 4.1 % .
Virginia has the lowest corporate-income tax ( in all three , there are fixed corporate tax rates ) , at 6 % in all three branches of government .
Maryland ’ s corporate tax rate is 8.25 % and a relatively high 9.975 % in the District .
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that , in Virginia , lower government and local corporate taxes are demanded , and overall there is a better tax environment than in Maryland .
The study did not examine the district .
Despite the benefits , Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors .
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 % to 6 % , the same rate as Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 % next year .
If the government continues to achieve income targets next year , the legislation could reduce the government ’ s income-tax rate to 3 % by 2017 .
Meanwhile , the small businesses in Washington seem to be doing better , and so they pay more , according to the recent study , government and local taxes .
Corporate taxes that are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure organized by most small businesses - rose 20 % in the District , Maryland , and Virginia last year , to $ 2.4 billion , a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes .
Researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year , with a 6.2 % increase in overall VAT revenues for the government and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year .
Nevertheless , the room for Washington could lag behind if the federal government ’ s spending cuts affect the region ’ s labor market .
Partnership City : German Backs for Guangzhou
Hopes and malaria – including a popular combination in China .
Germany ’ s beer has an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt ’ s partner city in China is now seeking a bride , and also hoping for an air direct bond between the two cities .
Germany 's beer , eager in Frankfurt 's partner city of Guangzhou , is the urgent desire of officials in China .
“ We would be very happy if a German bride were to settle in our city , ” Vice Secretary Li Yiwei told the South Chinese metropolis to visit an SPD delegation this week .
Time and again , the official of China ’ s ruling Communist Party was returned during the talks on this issue of twelve million metropolis .
Guangzhou , who is also known in Germany as Kanton , was one of China ’ s richest cities , Li warned .
So humans also had the purchasing power to afford German beer .
The Dutch SPD ’ s leader , Schäfer Gübel , who led the German political delegation , said to the host that he would listen to a potential partner for the project in Germany .
" It doesn ' t take much for beer : good water , grain , and joy , " he added to midnight with the Party 's upper house in Guangzhou .
This life pleasure already radiates Mr. Li , flattering the host .
In response , the Guangzhou civil servant met with pollutants - but with rotwine , which was used to preserve food .
The Chinese Tsingtao brand is based on German practice .
Tsingtao beer is lauded according to the German imperative .
More Business Moving
A second desire by Chinese hosts would be to link the airline directly between Frankfurt and Guangzhou , said Vice Party Chairman Li .
The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but , in 2012 , it was canceled for economic reasons .
" It would be worthwhile again , " the local politician showed any conviction .
“ Business travel between our two cities is increasing . ”
Right now , travelers would have to take the way around Changsha in Hunan province , indicted Li .
Likewise , Guangzhou province ’ s management , whose capital , Guangzhou , is Guangzhou , hopes for airlining .
The province ’ s vice governor , Chen Yunxian , emphasized this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats .
" This is a very good idea , " said Schäfer Gübel , the Chinese vice minister , Li Jinjun , an intimate German Kenyan , nodded agreement .
Determined Partnership
The legendary Vice Party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting .
Li Yiwei was already on the Main , but not yet in that function .
He came to office only this year after his predecessor was promoted on corruption charges .
The local party leader , Wan Qinglian , also had to go .
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration that is being hardened by leader Xi Jinping .
The new leader , Li Yiwei , had worked before his party career for an American company , which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party .
Before taking office in Guangzhou , he was a top executive in Fujian , where the automobile VW was built a big plant .
Frankfurt officially adopted more than a dozen urban partnerships .
The connection to Guangzhou , who is 9,000 kilometers away , is one of the two sides , say , a student exchange .
Last year , the 25-year existence of the Franco-German connection was celebrated .
The South Chinese metropolis on the flow are almost as strong as eating in their economic power .
Next year , they want to achieve GDP of € 250 billion , and Li reported .
Joan River 's family " presses the Dam "
Joan River has been unaware of her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago , but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her disease .
" Thanks to your continuing love and support , " Melissa River said in a split today .
We all push the thumbs .
Her mother was told that , on Thursday after an emergency , the heart shutdown in a clinic on the Upper East Side , Yorkville Enscopy , was delivered to Mount Sinai hospital .
Doctors keep them deliberately sedentary and scrutinized until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs that continues to be described as " serious . "
The reactions came from many sides , including an overwhelming online sport by Donald Trump , Montel Williams , and Kelly Ripa .
Environmental Tremors and Rising Wages
Car and dust dust dustbin builders , which trade from today , will continue to be stricter environmental standards .
Much like refrigerators and washing machines , new dust buildings on September 1 receive a label in which buyers can see key data like the device ’ s energy efficiency .
New cars apply to the pollutant class " Euro 6 " more severe nitrogen oxide levels .
There is also more money for the rumors : they receive a federal minimum wage of € 10.25 .

AMAZON just confirmed what information had been reported on the Monday morning : online retailers and video manufacturers , and a host of other things , buy Twitch ’ s video services for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one anticipated Twitter takeover , but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company .
Three months ago , Twitch ’ s sale to Google ’ s video service seemed to be going for a cool billion , and cooperation seemed natural .
Twitch , created as Justin.tv only three years ago , was launched as a universal distribution service – a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for players seeking to publish their brain games , a " YouTube for Living Games , " one insiders said .
The Twitter interface .
And “ let ’ s play , ” a video client in which better hers give the ( mostly older ) games a tribute of secrecy theater , is already popular on YouTube .
It is just that YouTube is often dubbed when you want to describe Twitch , so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy has been solicited has been lured into a textbook example by an established technology company that buys a potential competitor .
It is a puzzle why the YouTube deal failed , because it was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon .
Everything we know for now is that statement by Emmet Shear , President of Twitter , “ We have chosen Amazon because they believe that they share our values and long-term visions , and they want to help us get there faster . ”
Another secret , honestly , is Twitter ’ s incredible success .
For snobs like me , who say that they prefer to exercise rather than watch , it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes watching others watch the Games rather than even take control of themselves .
It is one thing to watch a friend sit over the shoulder at 3 p.m. , while she is easily shot through Resident Evil , and another to watch a spinner shot at each other 20 times in Call of Duty .
All of these games could be seen now .
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego-Games , so , without their own control over the perspective , the addition can be a really good recipe for headache .
I admit that the speed procedures in which the Red Bannisters of our electronic age completed entire games are entertaining .
But , as long as a game or human literacy is not involved , his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
But what do skeptics like me know ?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month , and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic jams .
How , exactly , does Amazon want to make money ?
It is hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant video as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed .
But Twitch has something that every company likes : thousands of young men who are courted as advertisers .
As Twitch CEO Shear said , " Amazon and Twitch " both believe in the future of gaming , " and the medium shows no sign of contraction , not even beating , as a gamble .
On Sunday 's hill , there was plenty of eyebrows on the behalf of the burglib .
The concept of the organizers was correct .
Despite the strong rainy committee on Saturday night , an estimated 1,200 music fans were launched in the op-Air-Aird facility in the burgeoning species .
At times , the imposition had to be stopped .
" This was disgusting , " Ron Sem said , one of the organizers .
Salzwel light and fun .
Two Spanish words have named Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem , the name of Amula .
After all , the Open Air in the Salzwegian species is said to stretch brightness through Shows on the day and night .
Na , and fun comes on its own .
That turned out to be the beginning of Sunday , when the first visitors turned to the top Air .
A test for all generations had promised the organizers .
And they succeeded .
Around the utilities of the Burgese people , Salzwegians , as well as guests , had been nearby and humbled around the environment .
They persecuted the first live records , swimmed in the tact , enjoyed cool-headed drinks - short , relaxation and pleasure .
And that is more convenient through generations .
Whereas one in a ceiling on the extra white sand was on the firewall , others in a quarter of the wine in the Vinothek , the young were dying on the hill , a big attraction point for the smaller guests .
But even when it comes to child mining , volunteers literally had their hands doing all the way to cope with the urgency and reining in imaginative creations in small faces .
The sizers used the kickertites or participated in a skatboy workshop organized by the Goodfoot-Crew of Salzwedel .
Until the big rains came .
Shortly before 17.30 , he boasted the visitors , especially the families looked for the time and drought .
But the appeal of the firm did not diminish that .
" More people came than expected , " said Ron Sem , who referred to " success across the board . "
So nothing is at odds with a repeat of the Great Party next year .
While the content and size of the event has yet to be worked , Sem made clear on a first balance sheet on Sunday to the referendum .
He resented the need to stop the imposition in the interim .
Obviously , the security firm had been overseen with too little force .
As a result , some who had already paid no longer entered the pool .
The resonance was very good .
In a first conservative estimate , the Salzwegian mediator spoke of about 1,200 visitors who were in the burgeoning species .
There were problems with tone technology .
So the Hippp Hand blocks of the " nettled Rox " broke down their performance .
Technicians were unable to create a partially sensible sog .
The scheduled shipping line could not be built , because the tents could not be brought to salt because of a travel pen .
" Next year , however , they will be here , " says the organizer .
The premiers of Amula-Open-Air had more than succeeded in visiting .
And for bad weather .
But the organizers made some of the mistakes that will be made for the first time , but that will have to be eliminated in the second edition .
The Facebook social network also has to criticize the organizers .
" Sorry , but just expected more for 12 euros , " Melanie Meier says on the meeting side .
“ You have a bit bearing you over , ” Ele Zimmermann says .
Others do not see the initial problems so narrowly .
I find it very good that some not only square stupid , but really try to make a difference .
" Stephanie Jenze writes the amula .
Now it remains a year for those who are making these criticisms go .
New Radom in Berlin : Watch ’ s Signs
It is not as expected .
Rather , the ready building share is waiting to be used into the marketed construction plant .
The action is in the context of a larger action : almost 50 years after the establishment of space observation radar TIRA , the hill , the so-called Radom , will be restored altogether .
The new radar will be slightly smaller than the old one , with a measurement of 47.5 meters .
But the size of the world remains a record .
The final step to complete the new hill is to exchange scarce power .
The upper quarter of the old hills are separated and reduced with a crackdown .
After that , the last quarter of the new hills will be set up .
To the extent that the weather plays along , the action is to be conducted earlier this week .
Participating in Ice Bucket Challenge
Isabelle Roberts of Britain was writing so much when her skin water was gunned over her head that she violated her face ’ s bone structure .
This ice-bucket challenge was sorely misguided .
A woman was put in the hospital after she swallowed her up so much at Ice bucket challenge that she exploited her cattle .
Isabelle Roberts of Britain was so captured when her cowardly water was gunned over her head that she wounded her face structure .
“ Water was so cold that I was writing , and , while I did , my cattle remained simple , ” she said to The Mirror .
Iron water is shaken over the 20-year-old .
Isabelle Roberts a few Seconds Before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth , but it did not , the cattle was raped , and I then understood that something was wrong .
My mother and my sister saw this as well , and sneezed in front of laughter , but I had to get into the emergency room .
The UK ’ s 20-year-old population was put into the hospital to be restored after participating in the viral trend in the service .
The clip has been reduced to Internet sensation and thousands of times to Facebook and Twitter .
Is the Burguns about to walk back on a string ?
Finally , there has always been a spat between the two women ’ s brokers , Burgcontracts .
Now boards of directors are contemplating possible cooperation .
As a model for rebuilding the Woltshauser Burg , the late Richard Dimbath , former Chairman of the Woltshauser Burgfriend , led the project in the French guédelon .
A year ago , there was no good climate between the burgeoning and the burgeoning clouds .
So far , the view seems very different from how to deal with the history of Woltshauser Burg and possible reconstruction .
Now the two camps are moving together : talks about collective action should soon be held .
That confirms the United Kingdom ’ s boards of directors , Torsten Sjöberg ( Burgverein ) and Herbert Piffl ( Burgwood ) , on our newspaper ’ s demand .
“ I have called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could once sit down , ” Sjöberg reports .
In his view , all members of both clubs could again pull themselves together .
So visible successes are faster .
While the Burgwood round of the late Richard Dimbath 's suddenly wounded rebuilding of the mountain forest until recently , the burgeoning around Sjöberg is at the forefront of the " development and hereditary " of money .
Herbert Piffl , Chairman of the Burgfriends , has , in his own words , reveled with the call .
Ever since Dimbath ’ s death , he has been burgeoning .
A new leader is due to be found in a member assembly in mid-September .
Currently , according to the 74-year-old , the club matters about 40 members .
" After my friend Richard Dimbh 's death , we first called for respect , " this " period of thinking " was necessary to " consider how it could continue . "
According to Piffl , the new leader will go to the conversation with the Burgein .
Until then , the Burgese community could also present itself with an up-to-date view of its constituency .
Currently , Piffl says , there is not yet a presidential candidate .
" But I am confident that someone will find yourself , " he doesn ' t want to run himself , because he lives in Bad oil .
The new leader should be a wolf broker .
The petroleum wants the project " but very eager to continue working . "
The divergent views on reconstruction are likely to persist in Piffl ’ s eyes any time soon .
He value Dimbh as a " missionary , " always believing in rebuilding the burg .
Two similar projects , already advanced in Austria and France , would demonstrate that this idea is not a curve .
They are tourist magnetic , with a high turnout and voluntary aid flows from around the world .
Piffl : " I was also initially skeptical .
But , over time , I have increasingly come to believe that it makes sense to press ahead with the project , ” and that it can be created a " single setting feature " for flood cities .
There is nothing else .
Moreover , the project could be financed by EU grants , visiting tickets , and potential sponsors , Piffl believes .
" So I don ' t want to overturn the idea of rebuilding personally , " he hopes , perhaps , that the burgeoning may be moving on this point .
Their goal of first documenting history is " important and good . "
Afterwards , one could look further .
Smart Way to Save Uni-Teachers
Since the cost of uni-teacher textbooks for many students is more than $ 1,000 a year , the fast-second student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving ideal .
He invented a residence system for higher-semester books and offered nominal compensation to delay sales .
" My mathematics book normally costs $ 180 , but I received $ 10 for a semester and a Chick-A Kek , " said Schroeder , 19 who visited the Covenant College in Georgia .
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
He spent $ 120 .
College management said that students spend more than $ 1,200 per year on textbooks and student material on average , but there are various cost-containment options for students .
Online stores and creative approaches like roeders are increasingly the solution for students .
Treating textbooks is becoming more popular , so students can use a book for a semester , often at a far more favorable price than buying .
Neebo Inc , which operates more than 250 university editorials , said that the rent of textbooks had doubled since 2011 .
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were mixed in college bookstores last spring , said Neebos Vice President Tebefore Meyer .
Less than half of all textbooks are bought , according to the National Association of College Stores , in campus bookstores .
Here is one of the best deals .
Buy Online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price online , for which they must have in campus boards .
The ninth issue of " Calculus " vno Ron Larwon , Bruce Edwards , and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be used for $ 239.com , a specialized textbook seller , Chegg.com , for $ 239.99 .
Purchasing
When you don ’ t make the notes of others or ordinary utilities , used books are a good option .
" Calculus " is needed for Chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
Matt Casaday , 25 " graduate student at Brigham Young University , says that he has spent on Amazon .com 42 cents a spent issuance of " Strategic Media Decisions : Understanding The Business End Of Advertising Business . "
The book was sold for $ 48 .
Professors like Ingrid Bracey , head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls , recommended that students be asked about whether earlier spending was permitted .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to seminary work .
In such cases , older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
Except Chegg and Amazon , Half.com of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books .
Men
Removing textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well , think about giving them back , and don ’ t want to keep books after the course is completed .
They can save more than 80 % of the cost of a newly bought book .
A student , for example , could rent " Calculus " for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
Consider the terms of the deal with which you rent , including the penalties that might be charged with writing notes , subjugating , or using trades .
To be sure , if you don ’ t give back the book , the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book .
E-Books
E-boats , not traditional textbooks , are also an option .
Sometimes these books are effectively mixed by providing an electronic license for a specific period of big traders such as Amazon .com , Chegg , and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg has a stake in " Calculus " for six months for about $ 61 .
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers , because many classics can now be downloaded free , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
To be sure , look back .
Joe Gault , 29 who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School , recommends that ISBNN number be determined for the price of books , because it is safe to find the right textbook .
And before any online punishment , Gault argues , the book is indeed preliminary .
He learned this lesson the hard way .
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery , and finally paid the full price in college boards .
Why " Guardians of the Galaxy " became a cut-off ?
" The Expendables 3 " of Syinvestor Stallone played less than $ 30 million of his $ 90 million budget in the US , while " Sin City : A Dame to Kill For " played only $ 12 million of his budget of 70 million .
The film " Sex Tape " was tailored to Cameron on the opening week , with only $ 14.6 million , while infant movies like " dragon numbers " making it easy to disappoint 2 " gains as well .
An article by the telegrapher Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the movies could itself be the cause .
Collin called 2014 “ the worst year ” for child movies , describing " dragon numbers two " as a mere " functional " fantasy sequel .
For films for an older target group , however , it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
In July , Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic Assessment of every summer movie start that was shown between US Memorial Day and July 20 , 2013 , and at least 2,000 wives this year .
The results rely on Kinobesucher and film critics ’ opinion , suggesting that this year ’ s film hits are equal to that of last year .
Some commentators argue that the evolution stems from changing habits and the growing popularity of web-sharing services such as Netflix .
Director Jon Favreau , who is currently working on Disney ’ s forthcoming Jungelbook film , said to the website Hollywood reporter : “ I think time is changing . ”
We must accept this , not try to pacify the past .
In contrast to Hollywood production ’ s current weak cassavage performance , the net flix recently earned nearly twice as much as it did last year , with turnover of $ 837 million .
Last summer , Director Steven Gberg criticized the film studies for focusing too much on film film film film film film film film film film film film film film film film , and predicted a " meltdown " in Hollywood .
In light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that its dark prophecy may well contain a true core .
But , thanks to the potential cutbacks to be expected in the summer of 2015 , including Avengers : Age of Ultron , Minions , and Jurassic World , other filmmakers are more optimistic :
The manufacturer of X-Men , Simon Kinberg , recently described the decline in casual results as simply " cyclical , " telling Hollywood reporters that " Next summer will be the biggest summer in the Kinocasus , and nobody will worry about business anymore . "
A few years ago , when the two Tibetan districts were slashed in order to streamline the Ligen-division , this was a step in the right direction .
Now Germany has launched an additional 33th Federal League .
As a result , whoever has not risen has fallen .
For example , while Göttingen ’ s classic Torpedo has avoided a descent in the Supreme Relation , only fifth class is playing in the coming season .
Fourth class , Torpedo ’ s label , despite her grandiose breakthrough to the regional league .
Torpedo ’ s boys and girls died in the fighting league , as did the SC ’ s boys .
The SGLnarrower and the Torpedo Reserve are entering the new governing league , with Göttinger clubs no longer on display in the national league .
The names include TTV Geismar in the Federation League , the Torpedo Second in the National League .
What the composition looks like a better circular class is now the new district league south .
Here , TSV sailors , VfB lions , Torpedo III , Geismar , Einbeck , Hammenstedt , bovender SV , prison-keeping , the FC essens , and the TTC .
In the district league , regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC play away , in the TTC II districts , red whites , the bovender SV II , and the TTV Geismar II and III teams , with districts at least beginning to strengthen .
Güntersen , the TTC , and TTV Geismar II are all parties here .
In the district league , Torpedo III and Swobballs / wolves are running up .
The Nine Team
The SC is sending its girls into the small town league .
Nor is the SCC boys ' districts - there still Torpedo II - complete .
In a district class , Geismar , Tuspo Weende , and the bovening SV go to the season .
In the first season of the newly established Regional Association , the two gods began with nine teams .
In the West ’ s torch , Red White II , Bovender SV III , Laubach II , Torpedo IV and V , MTV Grone , Dransong fields SC II , Mielenhausen , and SG Lengakers II .
In the East Staffel , such as swaps and wolves , Nikolausberg , and Landolves .
The Damen-Kreislea League consists of Swolves / Wöllmarshausen II , photos dumps , shirts , souls II , Tuspo Weende , and the SG Rhume .
That is still better than in the eastern city , where circuit breakers no longer contain Damen teams .
Conspicuously , none of the six th class classes should be achieved , and here the innovative and operational circle board will have to be considered before .
NATO Summit : First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Protests were held on weekend by opponents of the NATO summit in New Sport .
On Saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newsport on an anti-NATO march .
On Sunday , some 150 people gathered in Cardiff to hold a so-called counter-summit .
Stephen Fairclough told us weekend developments , speaking to protesters traveled to Belgium from Bridgend .
Fleeding Teenagers from the Blue Mountain
ZEI youthful bugs were brought to safety with the silk winds , having trapped the night into the Blue Mountain 's blue in NSW .
DAS 16-year-old girls and 19-year-old man broke up in blackheath shortly after Sunday in Govetts .
Worried relatives wrote the police at around 20 p.m. , when they had not returned home .
An addiction to local police and rescue services broke up , and was found at around 23 p.m. , near the Bridal Veil .
The girl violated her knees , and the man had brought down his head .
Bailouts stayed with the couple overnight , and were flooded tomorrow on Monday .
They were put in a stable state with a health car to Blue Mountain ’ s hospital .
Escalating Anti-Government Protests in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 protesters had been forced out of PTV buildings , said the information minister Pervaiz Rashid .
After more than half an hour , the station resumed radiation .
PTV-director Athar Farooq has said that troubled demonstrators have damaged equipment in the response .
Dead or injured were not reported .
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the government , which they accuse of fraining in elections .
The police said that roughly a kilometer away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence had clashed with security forces on Monday .
In hospital terms , a policeman was injured .
On weekend , at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to reach Sharif ’ s residence .
They demand the prime minister ’ s resignation .
The powerful military , on Sunday 's night after a meeting in the army headquarters , called for a political settlement of the conflict to " waste without time and use without violence . "
As the saying went further , " The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state . "
The escalating violence has fueled concern about military intervention , which has already been more frequent in the past .
The protests , led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri , have lasted since the day of independence on August 14 .
Sharif rejects resignation .
Khan and Qadri called on Sunday for their followers to stay .
“ We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign , ” Khan said .
Qadri expressed a similar language .
Khan accuses Sharif of winning last May ’ s parliamentary election by cheating .
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
Then an interim government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect government neighborhoods .
The protesters had initially peacefully abducted before the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on weekends to reach Sharia ’ s residence .
Hobbling villages , after second season victory , rank three of the table .
For Rapid , a bitter week on Sunday , with 2 : 0 of Greens , Rapid ended in a conciliatory way .
" Victory is very liberating , " said Trainer Zoran Barisic , whose team had reached a twin boy with the European League on Thursday .
" The success experience was uncanny , " confirmed Captain and Torprotece Steffen Hofmann , who ran for three place with green whites .
Smart wheel trauma is putting Rapid on a winning street , with the second season victory , the right response to disappointment against Helsinki is to enter the country ’ s pause with a successful experience .
" We wanted to show a positive response , " said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel , who , with his superb leadership Volley of the Sixteenth Century , put the paths to victory .
" I thought I 'd think I was pure through Thursk Day fruit , fast smiling it under the line , " said 26-year-old people .
When a rampage on November 13 , 2010 , last time in a federal league article , it was for Ried .
Thus , the first championship event in the Rapid Dress will remain in special memory .
“ It ’ s something special for me , I ’ m from the Rapid offspring , ” Schrammel said .
Due to Mario Pavelic ’ s short-term grassroots blackmail , Left scrambling on the right defensive side and made his case very good there , too .
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position .
" He praised Barisic . "
Schrammel ’ s character also provided the flank to 2 : 0 by court members after an hour that finally made the decision .
For the guests could well have written before .
" Thanks to God we were lucky today , " he also observed scramble , insofar as he played on the summary of achievement and outcome in recent weeks : " The results have not been true , but the game changer has always been good compared to last year . "
Barisic even found that many games had " been better off than today " -- " the strongest team that played in that season . "
The first trifecta since July 26 has thus proven that the team ’ s agency , despite its intact , is intact : “ Today , my team has shown its character . ”
He is no less pleasant : " That we have finally played back to zero . "
Much work during the country ’ s games is also that several defaults must be found with Brian Behrt , Mario Pavelic , Christopher Dibon , Deni Alar , and Michael Chimpelsberger , and Srdjan Grahovac , Stefan Stangl , and Philip Sobberger all made the victory even more valuable .
" Don ' t forget this , " he warned Barisic , who has lost his reputation and Pavelic players over the past three days , " who have been very stable lately . "
So the country 's game game must be used to " lift wounds and put a little on the physical realm , " says Barisic , with five U21-selection camps in his ranks .
One who is arguably the pause is Captain Hofmann .
He breaks up for the team , transcends pain .
It is during this hard period that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , " contained Barisic . "
Hofmann not only provided the Rapids game before it was changed in the 68th minute , but also achieved the second goal .
For the 33-year-old people who completed his 35th Bundesliga game , it was the first time out of the game since November 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 , the Admira ) .
Hofmann : " Don ' t believe that everything is good now , " we 've certainly had some luck , but eventually that happiness must come back to us .
Now it was past time , " Hofmann said .
But he has vowed to work too concentrated : " You can not always see this black-and-white .
We have not played as badly in recent weeks as it has been .
But we also must not believe that everything is good now .
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
It is a very young team that I can help for now .
This goes on to me in certain phases , " Hofmann said .
Michael Baur , a Grand Coach , had little to blame for his team .
He regretted the rapid countercyclical repercer " from the magic category , " as well as the regular goal of usage at the 40th minute discarded by refereeing columnists .
The only accusation I can make to the team is that , in some phases , we were not concrete enough .
We have had too little degrees .
As domestic defense Maximilian Karner saw it , " It has done just as poorly , but we have found and even done a gateway .
By and large , more would have been needed .
There is Ruh under this Wible
We showed a powerful tribe in our mission of the summer series " My Good of Happiness " last Friday .
Several of these tree giants still exist in the countryside , and the educated coach is the " scourge " clause above the underground .
A bumpy footpath leads to the roughly 60-year old marriage .
It misses the rubble , basement , and vegetable malls .
A piecemeal drop from the mountain of construction , a kilometer north of the road to pasturelands , is it .
Vital looks like a natural memorial , stretching beyond the surrounding trees , and reminiscent of an American mammalian tree with more than eight meters .
A small boddha on a tree pump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
But , despite intensive research , there were only hints of naming origins .
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bishops Archig and asked elderly people from the underground to know what kindness they have with the scourge .
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation of the name .
Thus , until about 80 years ago , the brick brains were reported as carrying their animals from the underground into the painstaking , powered by stones .
The building blocks have called on the rise of exhausted animal guardians .
Now the area has regained its relevance , because the Vienna countries have , in fact , regained mirror spots .
The area has also been declared a central zone of the biosphere reserve pool , but Schneider has further discovered .
But the Stone Conventions ’ speeches should be cautious , because the sun ’ s warmth baseline is also a popular wherewithal for creatures .
A migratory route from the underground tree , but it is hidden somewhat .
Other paths have been spelled out , the direction is rising , and invited widespread migration .
Where is the water ?
But a water company searched for our next job is unlikely to be found .
Mirror bridges already give a good impression on the construction plant , but we have some historic buildings in the countryside that could fit the building conglomerate .
Where is our " piece of good fortune " ?
My Good of Happiness
As with earlier Main Post vacations in recent years , when they have the right solution , prices will return this year .
Those who like to photograph can also participate .
Under the e-mail address of the new town of @ mainpost.de , you can send us the solution , and you can send a very personal " piece of good fortune " under that umbrella .
The beautiful photos are published .
After weeks of dithering , Italy ’ s prime minister and current EU leader , Matteo Renzi , voted against strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s European Union Special Summit , to his foreign minister , Federica Mogherini , the head of EU foreign policy , and the British Catherine Ashton .
Renzi , as La Repubblica , the government ’ s close daily newspaper , regards the appointment of his Mogherini , who was a favorite in the government team , as strengthening the position of Social Democrats and his own in the EU .
He also expects a boost to his " reform package " in Italy .
Last but not least , Renzi is hoping to sooth the leftist party base that he has opposed , because Mogherini is assigned , though more moderately , to it .
Conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council , Donald Tusk , say the prevailing view in Rome , so that political balance is made .
After all , the EU ’ s chief diplomacy is becoming Commission President Juncker ’ s deputy .
The EU parliament ’ s outgoing approval is still certain .
Otherwise , President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 411-year-old leader of the ruling Democratic Party ( PD ) an " important recognition " of Italy 's role in the EU .
La Republica disseminated optimism that party leaders have been proven for nearly two decades , and that the " huge challenges " of their ambition will be met .
The native-born villain is married and has two daughters .
Her party career began in 1996 , at the youth organization of the then-Democratici di Sinistra ( left-leaning Democrats ) , which joined with Catholic centrist Margherita in today ’ s Social Democratic Party .
In 1999 , Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth ( European Young Socialists ) for three years .
In 2001 , the election to the Left Democrats ’ Council brought them into the high party politics , working in the foreign policy department , whose head soon became the leader .
It occupied traditional focus on Italian foreign policy , such as the Middle East , was known through studies of NATO ’ s use in Afghanistan involving Italy with a contingent force , cultivated contacts with European social democrats , and with US Democrats .
Since 2008 , she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies , where she is an expert on defense and European and international affairs .
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014 , he called Mogherini into his secretary of state .
If the PD today has a better relationship with the country ’ s strong domestic peace movement , which contributed to the party ’ s more than 40 % of the vote in May ’ s EU elections , Federica Mogherini has , as PD notices , done .
The PD ’ s reservations in Brussels that new EU foreign officials have too little diplomatic experience , so the absence of substance .
In Brussels , especially by Poland and the Baltic members , a mockery of realistic Mogherini ’ s actions to the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and denounced as a “ pro-Russia course . ”
It supports the South Stream pipeline , operated by the Russian firm Gasprom , through which Russian natural gas , bypassing Ukraine , should be transported directly to southern Europe , as well as Italy ’ s energy security .
After Renzi took office as EU President in July , Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit .
Photographs that they showed with Putin included at Shakesh Street were also indignant in Brussels , and that they invited the Kremlin ’ s leader to attend a Mailland Economic Summit for October .

French Socialists were supposed to " keep up mouth and put France in order , " said Francois Hollande ’ s main ally .
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show " their love " for the controversial Socialist president whose cabinet reconfiguration has been met with disapproval among the vast majority of the French .
The president deserves everyone ’ s respect ; he deserves our loyalty ; he deserves our support .
" It is our duty to stay on his side , " he said at great applause .
As a reassuring gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France ’ s controversial 35-hour week , despite strong calls for a relaxation of the pact by Emmanuel Macrons , the new economy minister .
On Saturday , Mr. Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to be " united " with the government .
But Christianese Taubira , the justice minister , dispersed sand in the wheels of a meeting of renegade Socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for " taking the French believe in their future . "
Marine Le Pen , the far-right leader of the National Front , ridiculed the Socialist Party ’ s constant infighting and said that she could not imagine that the new Val government would persist for more than a few months .
Francois Hollande is the emperor without a clothes , but neither is Prince Manuel Valls forced to form a new government when the old one did not survive even a summer .
" And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter , " said Faciulein Le Pen against supporters .
She reiterated her party ’ s reputation for dissolving the parliament , and said that she was confident that she would win in an early election and be prepared for government .
France ’ s ruling party was defeated in the municipal elections in March , and the right-wing National Front headed the EU elections in May .
A survey by the Sunday Journal du Disome found that 76 % of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of sliding into multiple rival factions before the end of Hollande ’ s term in 2017 .
Pascal Perrineau , a political scientist at Sciences Po University , warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and redress the French .
" There is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel fast that things change , " he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could worsen further .

pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the vote .
A peaks group nearby the Chinese flag .
The National People ’ s Congress ’ s permanent committee passed a framework law on Sunday , allowing only two or three candidates to run Hong Kong in 2017 .
All candidates must first gain the majority support of a nominating committee , which is likely to be staffed with peers .
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote , prompting pro-democracy activists to maintain their threat and slackening Hong Kong 's financial square with " Occupy Central " protests .
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong , and China ’ s leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
After a Beijing White Paper was published in June proclaiming Chinese supremacy over Hong Kong , democratic activists held an informal referendum on the voting process in the special administrative region , with hundreds of thousands marching in the city ’ s business districts and organizing a seat .
Li ’ s interview is organized by Hong Kong ’ s government and Hong Kong ’ s Chinese connectivity office .
The deputy chairman of the permanent committee legal commission , Zhang Rongshun , and the deputy director of the Hong Kong State Council ’ s Office and Macropolitan Council ( Feng Wei ) should be asked over the day .
Student activists vowed to gather outside Hong Kong ’ s leadership office on afternoon .
Britain never envisaged democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong .
Putin calls for Kyiv to accept " state talks " with eastern Ukraine .
According to Russian media reports , on Sunday , on Sunday , Russian government requested that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east and begin negotiations on " statehood " in the breakaway region .
His spokesman , Dimitri Peskov , later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist territory of eastern Ukraine will be part of Russia , but that his status with Ukraine must be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to defend its rights and interests .
But Putin ’ s call for negotiations with the Kiev government on an equal basis with pro-Russian insurgents fits the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the riots began five months ago : to help separatists seize territory and pressure on Ukraine ’ s government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to secure de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West .
In an interview with the state television channel One , Putin condemned Ukraine ’ s military campaign to re-conquer separatist-held areas in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula Crimea on March 18 .
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the territory " Novorossiya " or " Neurussy , " a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glamour of the Russian empire .
Putin pointed out that all those who are ostensibly in Ukraine 's electoral campaigns of 26 th , and that while government groups hope to attack civil communities in the areas held by separatists in the immediate peace talks " are trapped in their illusions , " Itar-Tass reported .
" We must immediately start speaking out , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine to preserve the interests of the people living there , " he said .
Peskov said that Putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy , discussed for months by the Kiev people to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights are endangered .
Only Ukraine ’ s government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories , Peskov said .
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov said , " because it is not about conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but about internal conflict in Ukraine . "
The clarification of the Kremlin ambassador to correcting the " misreading " of Putin 's remarks underscored Russia 's leadership 's claim to deal with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea , which the majority of the two million people are ethnic Russians .
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine , because most of its 6.5 million people are not Russians , and pre-conflict polls yielded a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine .
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have appealed to international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine full authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , effectively giving the Kremlin control over an area that links Russia ’ s territory to Crimea .
Five months ago , the peninsula in the Black Sea is the sanctuary for most of the Russian navy , as well as a major trading port and historical coast region .
The regions between Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines , factories , and glaciers that make important components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko , in his June 7 inaugural speech , proposed that Ukraine ’ s legislation – after a new election – be applied to the constitution , giving each area greater control over its finances and language status .
But his notion of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast with that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels , whose armed forces and inciting Moscow .
Putin ’ s last call for Kyiv to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed another crackdown by the rebels last week , after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine through the previously peaceful region along the Axis Sea .
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasvsk , which , according to Ukrainian security officials , is the first step in a coastal strategic campaign to take over Crimea .
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have been underway to consolidate marijuana , a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants living between Novoasvsk and narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula .
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine , a former Soviet republic independent for 23 years .
“ We are on the verge of a point of no return , ” warned Poroshenko .
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine ’ s territory .
The EU summit did not take concrete action , requiring the leadership to propose further sanctions against Russia aimed at initiating an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 troops entered the Donbas region last week to support the besieged separatists , Colonel Andriy Lysenko , Speaker of Ukraine ’ s National Security and Defense Council , said on Saturday in Kiev .
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers included by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged for 10 Russian pilgrimages captured a week ago on Sunday .
Nacktfotose scandal surrounding Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no shame about his anger at hackers , who presumably have stolen nerve images of his dealers Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who is A champion from Hollywood .
The movie town is furious after a series of clear photographs of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal about online celebrity .
The hackers responsible may have 60 nackttos of Lawrence , Star of “ the Peter , ” and of superstars , including the Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne models , the singer of Rihanna , Ariana Grande , and Lea Michelle , as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst .
Of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer , Emily Browning , Yvonne Strahovsky , and Grecko of Melbourne , private photos were reportedly also published on an icloud gap .
The list is 101 profit .
Edelists who praised Grecko last month said to Condential : " It is disgusting . "
All private letters and images should remain private .
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others .
Grecko , currently in New York , reportedly said to a news website that the hack is " shameful , " and that the persons were " injured . "
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer , with her ex-friend Scott Speedman , including two roles in which she is upward without a pool .
Palmers 's movies include " love is invincible " with Liam Hemsworth .
Palmer , Chuck-Star Strahovsky , and the Browning actress at Sucker Punch , were not available for comments on the accompanying images .
As one Lawrence told the TMZ , " It is a hideous violation of privacy . "
Seth Rogen 's player denounced the hacker in his tweet : " Paint images from a cell phone are nothing different from the sale of chicken plastics . "
In purely legal terms , the proliferation of stolen images should not be tolerated .
Radler , Jogger , and Wilers were yesterday 's Great Feldberg wheels at the 8th anniversary , and thus helped the club " help " cancer 's sick children . "
The tour for which one was a torture culture was easy for the other to train .
In one , however , everyone agreed : it was fun .
Thomas Studanski probably slaughtered well last night .
For the first time in his life , the Chief Executive of the Upper Braul House fled the field on yesterday .
For the good reason .
He can easily pick away the small muscle consultants , given that participation on the 8th anniversary of the Great Feldberg campaign has brought a valuable insight into him in favor of the United Nations of " helping cancer children " ( Frankfurt ) .
One thing .
" I now know that I can - prima ! "
Small Pleases in the Applate ?
Nine , once I had stopped , would have been wagging ...
Like Thomas Studanski , who sits in the upper house parliament for the CDU , many of the 718 participants took to mountain yesterday , and came close to exhaustion , but happily on the Plateau .
Others , by contrast , found it easier to overcome the 11-kilometer long gap between Hohemark and Feldberg .
Norman Diezer , for example .
The Green Leaders acting in the Red Day -- red Dress , Red Bike -- made something of an unstatement at the start ( " Any quantity of professionals there is the target ! "
He , too , has picked up the fray in a rubble , as has Nina Kuhn , the city ’ s press secretary , who , together with Frank , had embarked on green trips .
For the two tribes , the " field radar " was not necessarily a sports challenge : " This is about charity , we are happy to do it - we would have done an exit today , " Kuhn said .
They then met Paul Wenzel of Colonel .
The boy ( 12 ) was submerged to the surface tomorrow to swing back to the sky .
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz washed the phrase at the morning at 9 p.m. , " made the field two times , only to break it down with fun .
fun was also " free toni . "
For the Chief Cultural Cultural Chief of the Chief Leader , Radtours are simply part of the story .
He had rushed to 40 minutes with his 6.5 Kilo-Kilo-renminbi .
A crazy event .
For that purpose - I am happy to do it , " Andreas Balzke said .
The muddled Mainzer says that he is an “ ambitious rentier . ”
He must be so , because he was on the way with the " fiction wheel , " which is a contender , but without a letter ...
It demonstrated that even without raids , the 20 migrants climbed above the White Wall and the merger at the summit , as well as a jubilant carrying out a car with weights at a grave .
Bergguard doctor Professor Volker Lischke , equipped with his team to provide security to Allrad bully and Quad , said , " I know " from Frankfurt who trained a special shooting raid , only that he pulled the plug . "
The 718 respondents - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to the table tomorrow 's factions .
The migrants first came at 9.30 p.m.
Then came the first cyclists and buyers at 10 p.m.
Five minutes later , the first mounta-carriers were laid free .
Bent Hansen , Chairman of the United Nations , " Radles on the Great Feldberg , " gave the Start Commandos and wanted the participants a beautiful escape .
Next year , he hopes to block the slippery slope to the field and security .

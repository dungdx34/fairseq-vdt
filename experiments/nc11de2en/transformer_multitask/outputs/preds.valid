George Webster has been accused of rape in Naim and Pitlochry
One man is in court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read in a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgov.
He is accused of raping a woman in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013, in Scotland's hotel.
The indictment is that website masters attacked them when "it was conscious, went, and could not signal an agreement."
Web windows are also accused of raping a second woman in the Gulf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiator for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Responding to the very American Idea of Labor Rights as Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to establish the organization of unions as a civil rights.
"Just as unions die, the middle class jobs die," Ellison said, a Democrat of Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
As a result, I proud to join John Lewis in the Civil Liberal Lewis Convention on Human Rights.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination as other forms of discrimination -- stopping anti-union forces.
Enlargement of the National Labor Law in order to create a way to organize a trade union representation to sue justice to a civil court - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to back to a very American idea.
Despite setbacks in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries around the country – Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and maintain labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remembered that this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom, and unification in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his stave encouraged the country to adopt a constitution aimed at ensuring that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
Aware that workers and their unions have played a role in creating a new Japan, they have used a language explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed to unite and act together."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler ’ s fascism is replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the need for workers to organize and to speak out in the new nation, the Germans gave a clause explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve labor and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and individual.
Agreements limiting this right, or aiming to reduce it, are zero and non-existent; targeted measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect its interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country consults other countries how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a union -- and that it should then be protected in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government officials.
Indeed, with these rights under attack in America, it is very wise to reconsider the American ideal, so working people must have the right to unite and get themselves heard in a free and open society.
Fifty years ago, as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the working movement did not restrict, but enlarged, the nation ’ s strength.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labor rights as a human rights - and the extension of protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that America has made in the past and have unleashed the promise of democracy.
Judges temporarily stop law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could be forced to close
For the time being, a US federal judge stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, enacted by Bobby Jindal, Louisiana Governor, to enter the law in June 1 and enter into force by Bobby Jindal, would force doctors who perform abortions to obtain a patient claim in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles for their practice.
But the judge ’ s decision means that, for the time being, doctors can continue to legislate abortions while requiring such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work as they seek to attain these rights," German judges John Gradevelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is used for the judges to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Supporters of abortion welcomed the decision to make the youngest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors gained more time to gain hospital rights.
"Today, the decision means that women in Louisiana will avoid a disproportionate law that they want to accept their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had accused them in the name of three of the five clinics of the state in order to halt the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict extended to physicians from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit, as well as requested the rights of instruction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that enacted similar laws, with courts recently failing to explain such measures in Alabama and Mississippi as constitutionally.
A federal judge stopped most of the clinics left in Texas ’ s government.
Supporters of abortion and the American College of Orange tricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that clinical rights of doctors require unnecessary constraints.
Opponents of abortion oppose that the measures serve to protect women ’ s health, even though some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one physician who conducts abortions in Louisiana has patient rights, divided the center for reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, the doctor would no longer perform the operation, fearing for his safety.
In arguing against the verdict, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish doctors for conducting abortions, while their applications to patient rights would be penalized.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment result in higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, have put a video magic for her mother online, dying from ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who found ovarian cancer in 2005, noting that only 25% were alive after the diagnosis.
The QIMR ’ s Berghofer Medical Research Institute research director Susan Jordan said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, risk of death during the trial was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE – New Drug could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined women ’ s health care for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosing, the type of ovarian cancer, existing diseases, and social and economic status also influenced life chances.
For elderly women, and those whose cancer had already advanced at the diagnosis point, survival rates were the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20% higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city are more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects that a belated diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers is possible.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, most of them in major cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services to counter distance, it proposed strengthening the service of captured doctors as a possible remedy to give specialists the opportunity to provide women to their homes, as well as treatment programs for people outside of their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study had a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer, underscoring the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
Today, the study financed by Rio Tto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Shortages Regrettably
The decline, together with an increase in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year if today's young consumers, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "core group of garden products."
The report holds that Mieter spends 55% of the amount that people with homes spend on their gardens on average.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of paternalism for parking purposes, and declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion are implemented annually in sales.
In the Greater London region, where the share of homeowners fell from 61% to 43% for more than 6 years, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and Royal Horticultural Society point out that, for the sake of meat or small gardens, housing does not mean that people can not move plants.
Guy Barter, the RHS ’ s chief advisor, said, "Container guards, for example, are very popular with fever, because they can take their crops in a switch."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden trading, owing to rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980's to the mid-1990's.
He also predicted a better market situation this year, owing to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April of last year.
The protest movement led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital, Islamabad, some 1,000 protestors have burdened PTV, state-owned television channels.
Information Secretary Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The station put in place for about 40 minutes, but is now sending again.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to get Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence.
Far a kilometer from doing so, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police set up tears.
The protestors demanded Sharon ’ s resignation, but opposed it.
The country's army, meanwhile, sees a political solution to the conflict "without time to waste and use without force."
After a meeting in Sunday's headquarters, the military divided: "The army remains committed to ensuring the state's security."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan, and has already become more frequent.
Imran Khan, the opposition politician, accuses Premier Sharif of having defied in last May ’ s parliamentary election.
The protests had escalated on weekend, after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to push ahead with Sharia ’ s residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey Makes a US Diplomat for Spying Report
Turkey ’ s foreign ministry has sent the country ’ s most senior US diplomat to issue a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Vice Prime Minister Bülent said that the US embassy and Turkish officials had investigated the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden, Edward Snowden, has shown that Turkey was a key area for US and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the report ’ s importance, saying that all major countries have spearheaded each other.
An earlier report that Germany ’ s most important intelligence service, Ankara, was also targeted, provided far more angry responses from the Turkish government.
Warning Storm: Local Leaders Threat Consequences

German locomotive leaders (Danger) trade union Chairman Sven Schmitter, said in Dübin.
We expect significant defaults.
Regional focus is not.
The main focus of the waiting strike is the traffic of goods.
The German Bahn in NRW announced that it should do everything to minimize the impact.
But the location did not say where to strike, so that it is difficult to foresee the consequences concretely.
Corruption ’ s Policymakers
The prosecutors issued evidence to the office of Mallorca ’ s prosecutor for blackmail by policemen and officials in the city of Calvià on Friday.
Calvià ’ s police officer on Mallorca ’ s vacation song Mallorca was arrested in the infamous Bin-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf, under charges of corruption by businessmen and barowners.
The main commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after charges of corruption against him by several Punta Ballena businessmen, the streets where most bars and nightclubs are in Magaluf.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence to the prosecutor ’ s anti-corruption prosecutor ’ s office on the Friday of the City of Calvià.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil, together with the charges of corruption, and are questioned by a judge with Navarro.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC reported that angry subjects said that the authorities ’ cronyism had a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer about money," one businessman told the Court.
Let our livelihoods be out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer, owing to a viral YouTube video video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who completed 24 men during a ceremony of Fellatio.
Infrequent authorities have since attempted to stop the proper behavior of alcohol vacation in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol candles.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organisator Carnage, together, must pay a fine of $55,000 ($7,000).
The tourist tourist tourist tourist city Magaluf, most popular with young British vacations, is also well known for several accidents of alcohol, including the "balancing coning" trend in which people walk from one balkon to another or from one balkon in the hotel pool.
The first Spring Day with Next and Storm weather conditions impairs flights from the Adelaide Airport
The FRUHLING has brought South Australia a weekly surprise, with fierce actors and strong wind, impairing flights from the Adelaide Airport.
On the evening to 21 a.m., another 5 meters of rainfall fell to the town, up from 6.6 meters that had already sunny.
The latest setback was the result of a series of short, stormy spectators, including a brief shot that began shortly before 20 a.m., causing a nearly 4 miles decline in about 10 minutes.
After last week ’ s winter produced an early dose of spring, the city ’ s temperatures plummeted to just 15.8 ° C on Monday.
The would-be weather conditions have probably led to the belated landing of a flying of vigor Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 a.m., but was hit by a slump - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be underway.
At that point, wind hit about 50 kilometers/h on the ground on the Adelaide Airport.
The airplane data showed that the plane had to launch in a second landing, and finally started around 20,40.
The flight delay resulted in the aftermath of the delay of some other rivers, including a Dubai Emiratings Curtain and a quantas-curse from Sydney.
Adelaide foresees a 16° C high temperature on the service day, with possible actors.
Matthies says: First Time for Great Network
Given the galloping technological progress that threatens to transform our cozy home into high-tech chores, our columnist Bernd Matthies resonates with a very familiar electronic home.
While I do, my look at the spiral cable that links the phone to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is it?
But there is a reasoning behind this: if the cable were not, all words would be ruthless in the house in the short term, and that would be a lot more retro.
What is true of the ectronic (ectronic)?
No, animal errors: electronic) the rule that today's world is tomorrow's electric bankruptcy is bought - dismantled.
For example, those who still have a village television in the residential room nowadays say that he fundamentally rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the Ifa ’ s insistence on the functioning this week brings us full incompetence on electronics.
"Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care, and Urban Technologies" are now promising the press office.
Yes, is there?
What is to talk about with people seemingly voluntarily spreading such a quark?
In essence, for about 20 years or so, it has been mainly because we have been worried about connecting our house.
For the Joghurt to succeed himself, so that the bride melting in the vacation tells us that it is burning in the workplace.
And would it be not surprising if we come from the office to our immediate arrival....
Yes, that presupposes a climate plant.
But a dream will almost certainly come true: we lift our arms watch, say, "Sauds!" and at home the dust bosses loom.
Make no mistake.
Everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between whites and broken ware blurred," an industry scientist quietly, and you can combine the wheat machine with a headache, the steam guard sends the weather report, and the data bright shows how long the pizza in Backove is needed, but that we are in the stau.
We also know from daily practice: if a new modical device is truly needed, the accus will be empty.
Another reason is that the spiraling cable on the telephone will survive the next jobs.
Israeli Children Return to their schools after the Gaza War
Hundreds of thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza returned to schools on the month of the day in airspace, having spent the summer in airspace, while missiles and murderers on their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and staying down schools in Gaza while the area recovered from the fighting.
The schooling began with a sense of pleasure and expectation from missile blocs in Israel ’ s south, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, staff of the "pashosh" child guard, hit by a missile, before the arrival of students from the wheat and beauty.
"We have a bit of fear, but we are excited," Ronit Bart, a resident in the Kibutz Saad and his Englishman said.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to routine routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said that "a little mixture" feels to go back to school suddenly.
"This was difficult times, and we did not go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of border communities like Saad remained in their homes, or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and murder fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murder grant, are still hesitating at the return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were placed in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza that is heavily characterized by the Palestinian assault.
He appealed to children to learn a lot, saying, "We will ensure that their knowledge is acquiring and provide you with safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed last day on an open-ended ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought about an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, like Hamas ’ s demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re-opening of Gaza ’ s air and seaports.
Israel calls for Hamas to disarm and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated to have been killed by Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this, and estimates that at least half of the grain are combatants, but offered no concrete evidence of it.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and murderers during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of the country ’ s south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military led more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were transformed into temporary protections.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protections and the fighting, educational authorities last week postponed the beginning of the school year.
“I hope that school will soon be reopened so that we can learn further, as the world ’ s children and Jewish children, ” Mohammad Amara, said, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a Gaza city school.
After Elections in Species: CME Vices Election
Given the NPD ’ s loss of votes in question, CDU ’ s Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition process in the federal court.
Berlin – According to the CDU ’ s Thomas Elecbl, the ongoing prohibition process against the NPD should come to an end in the federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is doing worse than it did last time," The head of the CDU is also a stranger in Baden-Valttemberg. "
This is a good development in the right direction and development that makes me more likely to see the NPD be fought politically, not in the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had barely failed in Sunday ’ s vote on the five-percentage-point vote.
A first race to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the Constitutional Protection at the time also had informants at the NPD.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council issued a new request for cartelage.
Germany ’ s government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Take New Refugees
Refugees are now being placed in seconds.
The first takeover of refugees in Harburg is bursting from all parallels.
Now, the Interior Agency has dropped three tents of the Red Cross.
District politicians were only briefly informed before -- they are unenthusiastic.
"These hawkish actions continue to stoke citizenship, and give politicians no way to constructively participate in the human settlement of refugees," says Britta Mamann, the Speaker of the Greens in the Harburger district Assembly.
Her party calls for the Harburg district administration to provide unused houses for housing.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
The reasons for overcrowding in the first place are the rush to help people -- and the fact that the authorities can not provide sufficient ground in subsequent facilities.
So many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, indicating a widely observed index.
The RP Data Coregic Local Home Value Index of Houses in Australia ’ s capital, according to RP data on Monday, rose 1.1% in August.
The increase in the total increase in June, July, and August 4.2%, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice the rate of increase in the 12 months ending in August 2013, but the rate of increase was not spread across the country.
The RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tier market.
The RP Data figures show that prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, compared to 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose by five and six% on average.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Herr Lawless continued to say that early start would witness a rise in the real estate sale that would be "undergoing a real test" for the next few months.
"When one looks at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally rapid sale rate, and the persistently low interest rate, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the businessman Peer Medau, and is asking this "like a field hero."
The style of higher education is not, it is said, in the sharing.
Indeed, in mid-June, the Medau family was already informed on the request of higher education.
The statement that the plans became known only in July is definitely wrong, "he said.
At the same time, he points out that plans are not "prescriptions or even decisions," but there are "preferences."
The building of the narrow street into the clock needed to travel is also less dramatic than the Medaus fears.
Of a nine meters of the street, it was, and is not, the speech.
After the current level of 5.50 meters, a meter-broad-broad-based meters, "he explains.
The argument by meal operators that their free and school-free parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future does not want to let pick go.
Admittedly, it is not because, like other public parks, it is now smartly resolved.
Thinking to the Residents
The mountain weight of children ’ s crystals on the ground, who would lead to the parking deck on their doorstep on their doorstep, is said to be "not impaired."
Instead, he remembers that "there is not only the child crust, but also the inhabitants on the Cathedral Square street and the 800 students of neighboring real school.
So the issue is far more than special interests of Mr. Medau, "he says.
Whether criticism of the Child Crisis Council of Child Crisis of expanding the street would "be" justified, "the reader can decide himself."
In early October, Preserl, along with the State Building Office of Bamberg, wants to inform city councils about the development of higher education by 2020, "and to address the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau had informed the children ’ s crystal parents about higher education plans last week.
Thus, entry to the new parking deck is meant to lead not to the Campus and the Friedvedev street, but to the meal mountain.
This would require expanding the smart road to about a mile length of secondary length.
According to the Medaus ’ s high calculations, traffic in the park of high fields would increase tenfold.
Of about 2,000 vehicles, the speech is daily.
The city has not yet sought to speak out.
Glorf Returns from the National team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
Flensburg-Handewitt, the 31-year-older of the federal SG Flensburg-Handewitt, has led mainly to health problems.
I have not taken my decision easily; she has been running for several months.
It is time for me to hear my body ’ s signals and to end my career in the national team, ” the world champion of 2007 told his Facebook side.
He thus has a record of 167 countries and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because the muddled feedback actor for the Flensburg Champions League won a few years ago, he is no longer available to the new federal strain Dagur Sigurdsson.
The Icelandic countries, who announced their cadres for the Switzerland game on the service day, conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have envy me as enthusiastically as my long-time co-players and my successors will.
But, for my club, I want to be healthy in the years ahead, which requires longer regenerational trades that do not permit the current double burden.
The left had even to fear its career after a manufacturing attack in 2012.
Achildhood ’ s problems had allowed him to be treated by teamers of the German Managing Association (DHB) with a cortisenger injection that had later triggered strong exposure.
Emergency operation and two more interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor that the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of Profi and 11 years of national team careers are not conspicuously over.
I have some health buildings that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-induced footoperations that were brief in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right.
This brings about some other disguised complaints.
As early as the year, I noticed that while I can not deceive my head, "Glandorf told the magazine" handball Time. "
He would only be in an absolute emergency for a comeback.
"I am always willing to talk," the double family father told the journal.
But I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play mobile phones.
I also need to say that, after my long hospital meeting in 2012, I have become pretty humble about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat well.
Aside from the 2007 WM-title and the gain of the 2014 champions League, he recovered the EHF Pokal in 2008 (HSG Norhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured with Flensburg the European Union ’ s chief winner.
Germany ’ s 0.2% Slumps in spring
The crises around the globe have stymied the German economy in the second quarter.
GDP fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 relative to the headquarters.
This divided the statistical office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring of year, while investment declined.
Foreign trade, too, slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual pact, the first half of 2013 will be a GDP plus a GDP binus of 0.8% relative to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of "Munisterland" motives, first led by the Burgman town on Sunday.
The Burgman town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fire drivers" on Sunday.
The Netherlands's largest sports association, NTFU, installed the so-called "Munisterlande Mooiste."
Yet it is the largest radar quake through Munisterland, the paradise of radar near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants owed to the Munisterland ’ s report at Jos Huerne for organizing this ride.
Written in various journals, the Tour was offered.
We come from the hero and went overnight to participate in the ride.
We want to know the Munisterland closer in this way, "the radar drivers enjoyed the way through the tribal, Borke, and Coesfeld.
Following the assassination of the Sta River Brotherhood, Sta.
Katharina went to a small "peace" through the city over Wall, where the start was also underway.
Furthermore, the route that was written for three different categories led to Herrenholz, through the mountain, to the Coesfeld, and through Havixbeck and Billerbeck, back to Horstmar.
On the ranks of 95 kilometers of 1175 miles, 120 kilometers of 1475 crops, and 145 kilometers of 1775 highs, the radar drivers have shown their good condition.
They were trained in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer, Jos Huerne and Mayor Exchequer Heinz Lofing, was very pleased at this rally ’ s request.
We are satisfied, and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems, and there were no negative incidents, "Heinz Loil fing favors the event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the executive had hoped, which was probably the poor weather forecasting and mortal rain.
"We see ourselves again in 2015, hopefully on beautiful weather on August 30, or during another weekend," the radar drivers nonetheless promised to return to the Munisterland, and the predecessors plan a new situation.
Constantin Wcker ’ s Dishonest Memoirs
Indeed, it is more philosophical than biography, which has put Konstantin Wecker, the proverbial broker, pacifist, politely activist, ex-detainee, in "monks and warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought laws for thought on June 1, 1947, Munichner written down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a proper favorite text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from online annexus as a gymnasiast to lady theft and drug use, he does not account for human weakness.
So, too, has he learned how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Breimbursement also takes abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, Ego, who is now his, spirituality - all of this attempts to go on the ground in a very philosophical, but also very personal, way.
He also explains his pacifism, his social critics, his political commitment - and, indeed, how music has shaped him (the operator has become the sovereign and rock musician), but also his prison.
The latter has brought Constantin Wecker closer to the asketic monks "produced by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary."
But there are also brief anecdotes to earth between all of the intellectual beliefs: about shooting in a lokal that GIs frequented, or a toothless car travel in which he visited a tree head-on.
Here, too, he is ruthless.
Lenny Henry – My father never took me into the arms.
"I love yourself"
Henry was one of seven children of Yamaikan immigrants in Dudley ’ s Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory and was limited.
Henry proclaims for a comedy, Rudy ’ s Rare Records, in part based on an imaginary conversation with his father and a series of radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of directors and radio, with vivid melodia.
But Henry had to work through a few difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother died, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw your face, only heard his voice: "St. with the stronghold.
Let your sister retire.
Mostly you!
I want to look at cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who had grown up when I was a child, took to the edge with him and talked about things like the form of the bidder label or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life, he was this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read.
Recently, Henry opened a brigade in Dudley, and, although conditions are better than at his father ’ s time, he gained a glimpse of life for him.
It is now a bit brighter, but they are dark, digested, deep styian laboryrina with flames and smoke, and a lot of blessing.
My father once simply went to the wake, and then could slowly hear him how he started to sink, because he could wash the gamble.
When I traveled there, it became clear that he had done so for years to bring food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Yet Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ favorite credentials.
My father never impoverished me; he never said, "I love yourself."
Only when my mother went badly when her life ended, "I love yourself, I love I love to say."
He could share the love he lacked as a child by his own daughter, with Dawn French.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop impoverishing me!
Papa, I am 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still pleased with France for 25 years to be married.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henry ’ s own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to their death.
So, when I became very, very overweight, and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled the picture and had to make a dramatic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is striking.
No one likes to eat crossroads.
Henry ’ s change in career life may be reflected in his elegant short-lived bart.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been captured by theater.
The comedy of the errors followed, and then August Wilson ’ s Fences.
This is a different experience from the meetings and comedoms that have filled its business life.
He began with just 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DDJ discovered him when he imitated and wrote to New Faces.
"I was the only black Imitator/Comedian on television for a very long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to learn not only before the public ’ s eyes, but also from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient Witze narrative, while I was a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny at New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the right to be found on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a slight entertainment program in which people were "black," Henry led his comedy for more than five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I would somehow wish it had never happened, but I do not remember that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of cheap prize of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 1980 ’ s on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to the show in 1984, and in the 1990 ’ s he was known as the chairman Gareth Blacklock in Comedyserie!
Advertising, documentary films, TV screens, and film roles shaped his next decade, but, after his 2008 BC-Serie LennyHenry.tv thought, "What does you like next, lie because it feels that it is all you can only get around or leave."
After that, a documentary for Radio 4 entitled What's so Great About...
The first consequence was Shakespeare.
I was regularly allergic in Shakespeare.
I had never learned anything right about him in school, largely believing it to be a middle-class domination, white in Strumphosis, and a cohort head.
So I fear it.
Everyone whom we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, meeting Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "thanks to it.
Don ’ t make it bad if you don ’ t, at least for that.
Nimm a few words in the mouth, and then you understand why we love all Shakespeare so.
Henry led 20 times in Othelessly ’ s last speech to the documentary film, and was enthusiastic.
I felt I could.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my heads right.
"That is why it is a serious thing, let alone a serious one, your text, the champions.
The samples were brutal, and I lull this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
He soon joined the comedy of the error.
Suddenly, I was in the national theater, and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought "Oh, you hate you change you."
There was a technical mistake, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to keep the audience.
"A small voice told me," You now have 10 minutes while repairing the computer. "
Instead, the chairman announced that once the problem was resolved, the idea would continue.
I went from the stage, and somebody in me said, "Oh God Thank thanks."
I am not responsible.
I can leave someone else.
"You play in a piece of theater, so your role remained."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, and it enhances the seeds.
This, too, was good, so it is like a great pilgrimage of gods that I say, "This is my destiny."
He says so, of course, with a DONNERNDA voice.
So I remain there.
I really love that.
I love to be in a field of propensity.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian – our conversation is pervasive by humorous outbreaks, while he consistently imitates people.
I have decided not to make a standard comedy, because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you look at it, you will find it before a wall.
I sometimes advocate live in the Apollo when I am pleased, but there is not as much as I once did.
I wonder whether he will ever again make him a standard comedytour.
I have heard in a room with a director who helps shape a first fraction and the end of a trip - I do not think I want to give up that ever.
So, is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actress.
It is a fun.
You always tell a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi ’ s rebels Block Roads in Yemen ’ s capital
In the conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis has called for civilian disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Huthi-followers had occupied key streets in Sanaa on Monday, a Speaker of the Huthi Party said "Ansar Allah."
Travel to parliament, too, has been blocked.
Yemeni ’ s media report a capital traffic screen.
According to the newspaper's "Yemen Post," Huthi leader Abdulalik al-Huthi, the Sunday's edition of the newspaper, called for action.
Huthi, according to the newspaper, threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met.
The Shia Houthis is fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the government ’ s resignation.
The Hutthi people ’ s origins have been besieging Yemen ’ s capital for barely two weeks.
Roughly 30,000 rebels have erected protest camps on the big Sanaa area.
Across the country, bloody battles with the Yemeni Army persist.
Kenya is registering civil servants to contain "mental workers."
Kenya telah mulai menjadi penangkapan pemerintah biometrik untuk menghadapi "pendududuk pendididididiri" dari pemerintah pemerintah pemerintah.
Officials who do not register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid were a government division.
The government suspects that thousands of people will be paid even after leaving the public services.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public services when he took office in 2013.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) was lost each month in payments to "mentally employed" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts after a person died or left the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from Nairobi capital.
All officials must now look at identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure that their data are included on biometric registration, a government lesson has been shared.
Everyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be cut off the payroll list continued.
"This action will go a long way toward rationalizing the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and adjusting the salary list at both levels of government," Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the arts adviser Helge Achenbach is first negotiated in court on November 11.
Five heirs to Berthold Albach, the son of Aldin ’ s founder Theo Albright, call for €19.4 million in a civilian trial in the desertification village of the countryside court, and two of its companies in bankruptcy procedures.
This divided a court advocate on Monday.
In the blackmail, it is said that Achenbach has cheated in purchasing art and Oldtimers, and that Berthold Albach has calculated higher than actually paid purchasing prices.
This would have been a higher provision.
Achenbach has purchased value in terms of common law for €121 million.
Children Need Road and Rivers
44 years he was in school service, of which 23 was a school provider.
In that period, Manfred Judges knows many of the peternified puppers and colluters of their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his desire to see people in the student.
The snow snow is the best-known mountain of the giant birth.
Managing judges love the painting with the motive from his home.
Judges were born in 1930 in trauma/Northern Hemisphere, now Trutnov.
He was interested in the profession after four years of secondary school.
One year later, the Sun Germans were expropriated.
In a half-hour, the family had to leave its house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaggon in 1946.
So it wasted judges into the Senkaku Square village.
Teaching took place in Bamberg.
ManFred Judge had to go to Bamberg for six miles a week to the next railway station, travel to Bamberg, go to school three kilometers more easily, and go back to an end.
After two months, Manfred Judges got a battlefield in a Red Cross home in Bamberg, together with up to 15 fellow women in a battlefield.
In 1951, he made the first, and in 1954, the second state season, after three years of muddle.
Since upper francs had no first-time teacher for him, he went to Upper Bavaria and went to Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fadrie Come" was his first "service apartment" in the House of Commons.
In 1958, he redrew a three-fold salary in the reconstruction of teacher houses alongside school.
The house bought Judge in 1980, after the Kollbach school was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there have been three classes in chess in the Petermine Kollbach School, and five in peterhouses.
From the 1968/69 schooling, they were summarized in peterhouses in today ’ s radio.
When the instruction association was established, only primary schools remained in the field.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, then-rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld and ManFred Justice.
But photo shops grew, and so children and their teachers were able to move from September 1982 to the construction of today ’ s construction, which was expanded in 1997 after judging ’ s retirement.
Some of the judges love the intricate generosity of then-mayor Ludwig Götz, who also built on common costs and in expanding cellrooms in 1997, even though this was impossible under the guidelines of school building.
"Mayor Götz was very guilty," judges grateful.
Across his career, Manfred Judge never forgotten the reference of a government official who had responded to a referee of a school council on law and justice: "You can never forget love," and mantra implemented judges what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give your children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "Don't always do this," and whether he means only his or his own six children or her own is not quite clear.
In any case, judges Tun was sometimes unconventional.
When students examine themselves, they did not get a criminal work, nor were they disguised.
At the expense of the community, judges had created two pairs of boxes and left the two contractors against each other, even if there was a vetoing.
For the sake of the school, judges served as a rector a good relationship with then-Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
It prompted the partisan judge after retirement to run for the Commonwealth in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list.
But judges were elected sixth and joined the CSU.
Three Days
HR4-RADTOKORE 700 bicycle drivers Up Bad Salzopze and Scots
This is not special in itself when Radler runs on her tournament in Bad Salzheisen or Scotland Race.
But on Friday alone, the number of astonishments seemed to be felt: the 700 participants of the hr4-ratour and park of corn droves enjoyed a pause in the lower Kurk of Bad Salzhstan, and later a party under free heaven in the Scotter Alteburgpark.
Under the slogan "Radle and celebrating in newly discovered ways between Nidda and Children," the participants met in Bad Vilble on the Donbas Day and lived through a joint Van Baker and Baker.
On Friday, it became serious: the broadcaster took the first bells, 60 kilometers on flu town to Bad Salzhell, and on to go to Scots.
In Bad Salzhstan, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had joined the bicycle in Bad Vilble, and the head of the Bad Salzhstan proprietary operation, Petra gaze gaze.
Everything had been prepared to freeze the body and spirit: the countrymen from Rantown and Dutch mocking town had smashed 85 levees of apples, breathing, raw, and cages, which miraculously admired the infamous brothers.
"Such a pie can only bail countryside women," a participant praised from apulenas, while he ordered another piece.
The beaches of the Geis-Nidda tournament could have cold frictions.
The "Duo Bravo" kept visitors with known reporters from opera and music music pleas and made enthusiastic pleas.
The parks ’ beautiful ambition was exciting.
A master also had a headscarf paper from his partner: "He deserved, after all, he has reinforced already flooded bicycle chains."
Meanwhile, the mayor and operator had to work: they were interviewed at the wall before the drinking house of reporters Rainer Janke, using the opportunity to plant in the radio for Bad Salzhstan.
Tobias Hagen, too, has been able to handle promotion chief since the first Radtour in 2004, but he has had plenty to do with local technology.
His pickup shift, communicating with his staff and police staff ’ s 15-member motorcycle arm, writing Facebook contracts, and reporting reporting reporting, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine Main area," he said, "but also from bricks or fulda, from lunchess or Taunus, and even from many Western cities.
The number of participants is based on the overnight capacity at their disposal.
In category I, participants are placed in hotels, in category II in collection.
From the Kurd, the radar had a good impression when, after a half hours, they reappeared: "Chad!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhstan!" They went away.
After the arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to settle a brief respite.
But by the evening, the radar was called for in the idyllic alteburg park.
Under Scotland ’ s tourism and urban marketing society (GTS) governance, the park had received a beautiful solid ambition, and, of course, had been prepared for soils, such as flames with well-cooled federalists.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hosfeld, and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed visitors in his function as head of the ADAC ’ s chief.
The three were apparently pleased by the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the tanks.
The window of opportunity for unfettered gratification under the blueprint, despite sports on the bicycle, was eagerly used.
Among the guests, citizens increasingly migrated by good mood as well as the big shoots of the radar drivers.
On the second day, the stations of Birstein, the guest bacheau, and Bad Orb -- including a conflagration with the trendthresholds -- were on the agenda.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radeln, athletes met again in Bad Vilble.
Assured by Dozens of Turkish Policemen for "Conspiracy" on the Government
Overall, 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the “conspiracy on government, ” local media agencies have reported.
Police officials did not issue an immediate comment.
Among the arrests, 14 senior police officers are reported by hurrival Daily News.
Some were involved in investigations of corruption against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly establishing organized criminal association and applying telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not All Children in Ukraine Return to School
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened up to summer vacations on Monday (September 1).
This day has traditionally been an important day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told warning journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
September ’ s celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not everywhere over Ukraine peacefully.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
All of Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian People ’ s Front, must fight for peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, the Slajanzk School ’ s school school chief, visited Yazenjuk ’ s daughter, spoke of Russian.
We hope that peace is finally back here, and that children will be given an education that will be useful to them in more life.
The first school day in the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children bearing troubled shirts, holding Ballon in their hands, and listening to their teachers.
With Rona Fairair, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
It coincides with a proud acceleration from the banking world, media management, and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own frontline experience.
Their career began with the world ’ s management advisor, Bain and Co., which changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearson.
She served as Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when the parent company Pearson ’ s top job went to a younger male colleague.
Their invention was supposedly almost €1 million.
Their political rankings are also solid.
She was rewarded Cameron by Lord Browne, the former BP chairman, when he searched for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the adviser of the cabinet.
Their husband is a former Tory Council member.
As early as May, I described the chairman ’ s job with a poisoned corner.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: inward on the first guard of the BBC ’ s own management ethic archy, but also on the outside side as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This gives rise to an almost untenable duopoly requiring comprehensive reform.
But which new leader would risk stepping up, beating for everything, and taking on an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps talking for his job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that were not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC smaller -- power, money, and status overtaken.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the coming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of $155.50 per year, the British public certainly buys into the world ’ s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40 Pence a day.
And, apparently, the BBC is rebounding to the popularity scala: 53% support it today, compared to 31% a decade ago.
The maritime and user habits for the BBC have changed: I now have news headlines on my cell phone and look for misguided programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loved and considerable institution.
It needs a considerable leader - I hope it has found him.
Texas Perry says that Abysmal Tweet was not authorized
A web of the official Texas Governor Rick Perry ’ s Republican Governor on Sunday, Rick Perry, contained a corrosive remark of the democratic district lawyer at the heart of a criminal charge for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later scrapped and replaced by another by Perry ’ s user account, which took off the previous one.
I have just sent a tissue from my account, which I had not authorized.
"I don't cheat the Tweet, and didn' t," he said in the later news.
Perry staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry ’ s official user account were out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
The former Tweet recorded an unfavorable picture of the travis County prosecutor, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to tax in April 2013 for darkness.
Perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to resign, leading to a charge against Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - to an outsider before a Grand Jury this month.
The text of the Tweet is that "I don't always drink with the triple alcohol mirror … but, when I say it, I sue Governor Perry when he applauds it."
I am the darkest democracy in Texas.
Lehman ’ s office was not charged with running the Grand Jury investigation of Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry is not guilty, calling the prosecution a political trick.
His high-class team of jurisdictions asked for prosecution in the case of judges, arguing that the law, with which the most senior governor is opposed in Texas history, is incomprehensibly diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in government funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the State, which is based in travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehman refused to resign.
This veto provided public complaints by a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famously.
Having completed as a fifth during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry was betting on speculation that he would stop by standing a tissue of a photo near a lake, in the words of "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley once again explains the housing market as "normal."
One of London's most prominent construction entrepreneurs pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England has "returned to normal levels."
Houses in the capital were hot and subject to huge price increases, which led the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage loans in June, owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and CEO of the highly classified construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013," and has added that this is a "stable business environment."
The real-estate market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the cat ’ s information, prices in the city ’ s own have risen by 18.5% last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales.
Average prices in mining ’ s private, cheap, and student offers rose by about a fifth last year, and were £423,000 at the end of April.
But a stronger pound has made real-estate ownership less attractive to foreign buyers in London in recent months, some of which have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "Vill Tax" from the general election next May.
The London real estate maker Foxton warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which envisaged sharper lending, would also lead to lower market growth in both real-estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England of Monday show a decline in July ’ s mortgage approval, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real-estate agency, downgraded its forecast of the rise in real-estate prices in London in 2015 to 3%, on the basis of an already weakening one.
The volume of transactions in London ’ s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, has now fallen by one-quarter year on year, according to the maker WA Ellis.
Yet the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a boon, because the maturing amounts of futures sales are more than £2.2 billion.
As Pidgley added, "demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations remained stable, and futures sales remain stable as a result."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes by the end of April – almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
The annual pre-tax outcome rose by 40%, to £280 million per year, to £1.6 billion.
In a meeting of the company ’ s annual assembly in Monday, Herr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley this year are likely to be equal to current market expectations.
Analysts agree with the annual pretax result of £450 million.
Berclinical stocks stood at £23.96 on the afternoon in London ’ s trade.
The Internet ’ s Jennifer Lawrence Game
Jennifer Lawrence ’ s appearance at the 15th Oscartels.
Nacktphotos of Oscar-Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 stars.
A star representative of "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real, and complained of the hacker for "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally postponed on the Footto-Sharing side 4chan were allegedly filled by a gap in Apple ’ s online storage system, the supposed "master list" of hackouts, including Rihana, Kim Karshian, Elizabeth Winsen, and Mary Kate Olsen.
It is not safe how many of the images are genuine, though Winstein also denounced the hallmark of "Scott Pilgrim" against the rest of the world.
"To those of you who watched photographs that my husband and I enrolled in the private environment of our house years ago, I hope you have been so satisfied with you," Winston wrote on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice of the Nickolode "iCarly" and "Victorious" found that the photographs are images of her and tweets "of these so-called nucleus images of me are GEFEFELSCHT, people.
Let ’ s take the same time as start. * Work ’ s game intends to be ….
Buzzfeed reported later this Sunday that a spokesman of the pop stars Ariana Grande departed the honesty of her supposed photos.
Exclusive exit from Howard Jacobson's lofty new novel on love and letter.
They stepped apart, they could best be described; they were slowly unraveling like a carton that has been abandoned.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he is too serious, too harsh, intense, intense, distant, and perhaps somewhat vigorous.
And then he shaken his hands.
He knew firsthand.
He was stubbornly, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this inertia was a newly beginning affair that had been more promising to alleviate his life ’ s lonely boredom than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was a citching beauty with untold hair and a flat hearts from a village in the Northern Islands that was even more remote and smooth than plot.
She had come to the south with an older parallel that Kevern thought was her aunt, inheriting a basic piece in a fired but paradical valley with the name of Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The red was leaky, in which bags were still spinning, nudges had left their traces on all windows, believing that they belonged to it, and the garden was riddled with brains that looked like huge cohorts.
It was, like the house of a child ’ s marriage, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the London list for the Booker Prize of 2014.
The hortlist is announced in the coming week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn ’ s blessing on the broken love of high grass chickens and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of which had implicated himself in the service consols that had long caught the country with reassuring music and disgusting news when the eyes of its creatures had given him a black song to his father.
Their feet is too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, Songs were no longer played on the Console.
Not prohibited -- nowhere was this right -- simply did not matter.
It was successfully obsolete, as was the word obsolete.
The generalized taste created what no fix and regulation had ever accomplished, and how people chose the Vom-Tellwarm memoirs, cooking books, and love romanes on the music, they chose the balance.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary crop and play a large feet in a grob-comedian serene Ailinner.
Ailinn didn ’ t understand this.
"This was a well-known song by a Jazzpician named Fats Wall," he told her, and automatically put her to his leagues.
This had always been done to stop the letter of the letter, before coming out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you start a word with a TY without putting two fingers above your leagues, it costs you a penny.
It had not been a very minor game back then, and it was not now very fine.
He knew that he expected, and he was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard that.
Jazz was not played, though he was not directly banned.
Improving was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite certain at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
It is also reason.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And Yazz was mutually expressed.
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz of his father ’ s half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats was all black.
It probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A conformed society meant that every element of this society grateful to the principle of group talent -- thanks to what was destined.
People with African-Caribbean origins were characterized by temperament and body building for entertainment and sports, so they declined and burned.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, and were charged with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service.
Whatever the left of the Polish community was concerned about channeling; what was left of the Greeks crushed Teller.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly when WAS GESCHECHEA WAR, WENN ES GHES GHES GHES GHEHEHES, had done so - fearing being charged for frenzy, even fearing that the flames would eat them next - had been open to restaurants and unrepressive.
Everyone according to his skills.
Because it had heard only Balladen, it was difficult to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just made to be relieved.
Music reflected love.
"They are not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except perhaps for people whose feet is too big.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved the lied.
He talked too much, but the neglected guard gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the vast coherent plaintiffs.
Ailinn still didn ’ t understand.
Why should your father have loved such a bit?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to go back to two fingers in her present.
They already thought that he was somewhat strange.
"He seemed futile," he said instead.
She smashed her head insofar and blocked Keneti ’ s view.
There was nothing more to see around the world than their cold black hair.
There was nothing that he otherwise wanted to see.
"If you say it," I think it without conviction.
But that does not explain why you fear it.
It seemed to be worried honestly.
Are my feet Too Big?
He looked for once again.
Their feet is not so direct.
Perhaps your blessing, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my blessing is too bad?
Did you hate?
Of course, I don ’ t hate you.
But that is only the stupid lied.
He could have said, "I love yourself," but it was still too early to do so.
"You please you," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
This did not sound right.
It should have been comfortable.
He often got into trouble when he tried to be compelling, because, like his father, he did not have the reassuring charm needed to tame the inherited cruelty.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be that.
Despite his benign eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and out of her favorite, dismissed the consols, and shaken the wine that they had drinked.
Holunderflourishing wine, so Trunkenness was no excuse for him.
They seemed to be joking, like palmwedel in storm.
"And your poet is precisely why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Besides, I am not at all.
She did listening to him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendness of his words and the fear that they felt when they opposed him.
Do they want to beat them?
She had not told him of life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same.
The same huge and elderly ocean collapsed here as there was on the shores.
The same confused men, with ever thicker skin and more vilified to DEM WAS GESCHEHEHENS WAR than their ancestors had been a smugglers and smugglers, were drawn from kneipe to circulation, and always willing to oppose a woman who refused or lost them.
Dickpit?
They would have shown you a thick fist if they did not adapt!
She was only banned -- Knuttles were the most widely used word for an erotic appeal between men and women, a counterpart to the gender-love ballots of the console -- they are quick and then beating.
According to Krugman ’ s view, this was an unnecessary hostility, because the Knutots themselves constituted an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign of his body.
He listened out of love like an old man.
She felt to remain, but she was surprised by the joke of his mourning.
That was not the end of the world.
They barely knew.
She watched him watch remote -- as he did from a upper floor in the upper bloc -- as a man, complained by something he had herself spoken.
Adam left the garden, they thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, beating, shaming, defeating, defeating, and defeating her back without combat spirit - why was that a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember the only time she had seen such a thing before the day?
Once it was alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet.
Several years before the newly reported events, Esme Nussbaum worked, a smart and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on the job of Ofnow, the non-legislative surveillance body for the public mood, was best invested in a short lecture on continued low - and medium-size violence in precisely the country where reduced, if not elimination, was best expected, and the energy outlay.
"Much has been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the alleged aggressiveness of a people who fought thousands of wars and won most of them, particularly in the country's remote corners and valleys, where the south act of human friendship has historically been felt despite the lofty churches between the armies.
But some properties turn out to be inexorable.
The higher the church turbulence, it seems, the lower the passion that he continues to inspire.
The population wakes up in the words of sentimental ballots, deprived of stories about overlooked difficulties, and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the earlier raw raw hand of rural communities, as well as our urban fabric, but also evidence of the emergence of a new and disproportionate effort at home, the workplace, on the streets, and even on the field.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," their mentor said when he read the entire report.
I propose you read fewer novelies.
Smart Nussy ’ s tree diminished their heads.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I believe this does not have to say," Esme Nussy replied.
Are you lesbian?
Once again, eggs referred to their right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Once again silence.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I oppose atheism, readers, or feminism.
This is a prejudice of jobs.
We serve a prejudicial society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, inherently acceptable and laudable, can occasionally distort outcomes that you presented.
They obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things you call "disproportionate" and "red" may be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural force and vitality.
If you move further on the way, WAS GHECHEHEE IST, WENN ES GESCHES GECHES IST, would have meant yesterday taking the country its essential life power if it had happened.
Every nail tree looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED writing in Flamingorosa reiterated the advice that Ofnow had given the country over the past quarter-century or more.
Suppose your neighbor, evaluate your partner, listen to Balladen, attend Musicals, use your phone, speak, tell you, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the healthy word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want," Esme Nusstree replied with calm voice when she was sure that her superior had come to an end, "and I say nothing other than we are not yet as effective as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to DEM WAS GHES GHES IST, WENN ES GESCHEE.
This time, however, it is not the others where we leave our rage and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to indicate patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you call action" a mistake "that our grandparents may or may not have made.
They also go too far, saying that they had expelled their "anger" and their "mistrust" of "others."
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "us" and "others" in understanding the past, as in protecting the present.
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder that is all we know.
"Of those who are honest to ourselves," thoughtful marriages "can not claim to have good behavior.
I bemoan no one.
Whether it has been done badly or well what happened has been done.
That was back then.
Nothing needs to be said anymore - there is a consensus.
And, just as no debt must be assigned, it does not have to be blamed if such a declaration were appropriate and if there is a way to try it.
But what serves the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to forget them.
If I can say this -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider their report," he said, and left it.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overhauled by a motorcycle driver who, as passerss-described, had taken a form of "brutal rage" in the footsteps.
There are accidents.
Lesothoven ’ s military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied that they had planned a coup to overthrow the government, saying that they opposed policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country, denying that the country ’ s army had repatriated its presidency and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to the neighboring South Africa after reporting the threat of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no de facto coup, but that the military responds to the threat posed by police "political fanatics."
"What happened tomorrow, the Staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements in the police would actually operate some of the political, partisan fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc with Voice of America."
As the South African leader Clayson Monyela has said, military action has made the impression of a turnaround.
"While no one has claimed that the government has been torn by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces so far show signs of a coup," he said.
Speaker of the Lesotho military shared on Sunday that the soldiers would withdraw into their barracks and be calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Vice Prime Minister Mothetyoya Metsing takes governance during Thaban ’ s absence.
Thabane said that he had become a target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings because of the conflict in his unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite other allegations.
Manufacturing in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The rise in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the past 13 months in August, a scrupulously observed study.
The final market it shopped shopping management index of manufacturing (PMI) in August fell to 50.7, after a level of 51.8 in July.
More than 50 is spent on expansion.
New contracts were back, and factories collapsed at a time of rising EU-Russia tensions over Ukraine.
The figures come before the European Central Bank ’ s meeting on Donors.
Markets expect the Bank to adopt a clear plan to deal with a delays in the eurozone ’ s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There are speculation that ECB Governor Mario Draghi could report more this week whether he considered quantitative easing for the eurozone, in accordance with those made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although little growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers has become clearer," Rise Dobson, a senior economist at markit said.
The factory PMI, the largest trading partner in the EU for Germany, fell to 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, the bloc, France, the PMI, fell to 46.9 in the second largest economy.
France remains a careful kind, as do Italy ’ s decline from robust expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial conservatism do not attack Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, is also not reassuring, "Mr. Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best that can be said for the purchasing power index in the eurozone in August is that the sector continues to grow."
It added: "Provided in the eurozone, life evidently finds itself quite difficult now, as current heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in many countries ’ remaining difficult conditions.
These heightened uncertainties have clearly undermined the economy – particularly consumer confidence – and probably causes some contracts to be delayed or even died, especially big payoffs.
He said that it is "ever more likely" that the ECB will finally have to launch some form of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."
The wood decade is the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the dreadful siege of school, as the children caught in it still suffer.
A decade ago, more than 1,000 people were hostage by Chechen militias in a school in the South Atlantic school.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the sacrifices that had escaped the death of the classroom Greurates.
Just a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into revulsion, and, surprisingly, morphed into action and hope for the future in the midst of worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned after Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped the death of the classroom Greuum eltdown.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of these terrorist hell will follow them forever.
Their best hope?
That the war now afflicting Ukraine - and in which children like it die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in an attempt to bring back to the broken school spill
She was photographed and famously by Russia ’ s star photograph, Dimitri Beliakov, when she tried to climb into the slaughtered school spill only after a mine exploded.
Aida searched confused after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"One woman told me that I should be asked for my life, but I could not," Aida said back then.
My legs were anemic.
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother.
A soldier put them in safety.
After a series of surgery, it thought it to be wholly cured, but yesterday said: "Three months ago, pain returned.
I fear that I will have to operate no further.
Some giants are still in my knees.
Their aim is to become a tootherner in order to help people how doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me," she says, vigorously.
"This has happened to me, and you can not change that.
Once in the year, I am always in sports, to remind me of those who remained there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
Pain is too great.
My best friend and future class comrade Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, dreaming of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I attend my school and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, though the memory of each year is slightly weaker.
I am happy that many people around the world are still remembering our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the United Kingdom and everywhere.
When I watch the photograph of me online, as I get to school, I think that for the first time, many people see it, understand our catastrophe, and help ensure that this is not happening again.
The Young who fled through the Kugelhagel, believing that his mother is Dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As a winner, he said, "Mama told me that I should leave if there is an explosion and keep my hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "run the course."
Full fear that it could have died, he fled and saw a shaking small species along the way, took it in hand, fleeing through a bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who excluded his son, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
"I could not rescue them."
In reality, Tamara was stymied out, and had been in the hospital with near-injuries, in turn on the assumption that her son had died.
After reunifying, she said, "I stood up for joy.
I could not believe it.
He sat and impoverished me.
Damir was later fled to London (of which now the most disturbed newspaper News of the World) to get the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wished I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it becomes blasphant in my memory.
I also know that I was quick to throw away all my toy pistol.
But now I can play computer games with shoots, and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to sports, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the skin, and who did not get outward.
We never say that they have been killed or dead.
We say they remain in sports.
I remember my journey to London, particularly the gading camps, where I was able to choose everything I wanted, and the drive to a top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
That horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so eager for all those who are suffering from the billboards," Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a caster.
I like to help.
I want to go to the police one day, hoping that they will take me next year at the school Academy.
As his mother Tamara, 48, said, “37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine it?
I remember the terrible silence of the siege, there was simply no child who could call and go around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She is vividly reminiscent of her trip to London with Damir.
People in London invaded when I told our history.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
It was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and simply say her own that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the London meeting of her and her husband, and how Damir and me helped me.
I remember how Damir would like to eat Borschtsch and call them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with cellers in a restaurant, including me with his water pistol on her and she stayed away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now going on, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and still killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war, the news is part of the news they hear when they are borne or preoccupied with something else.
I simply know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can not stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
I became big and a very soft and quiet boy; he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He, for example, does not look for revenge; he is not overwhelmed by the past bullets.
I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class, and occasionally go to the sports and inflame.
When he was smaller, he suffered – I recall, sometimes on the sofa, turning the face away from us – for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to avert all of his weapons and other military toys, 17 of which is now larger than I, respectfully, smart, and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to its feet, I looked around, watching hell around me, with the body around the world.
I was absolutely certain that my small boy could not have survived in that hell.
"I remember that I called him," Damir, Start, Out, "but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it, and he has run away.
So, unlike that of many others, life continues for us.
Georgia ’ s Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Georgian Lyin, the Beslan survivors, with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, is a rightful image of Georgian today
His bloody face was marked by fear when he was burning for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his class cameras.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a physician, had deposed him for his first school day before she rushed to bring her elder son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left the dog about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, so my small boy stayed there for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not only was an entire family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgian managed to survive.
The closer that date comes, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think it is long ago, I think it had happened yesterday; some scenes of these days have come to mind.
Nobody will forget that, I am talking to you.
The picture of Georgian (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetrated as statue (right).
I remember that Georgian wishes to go to school this day, saying that he wants to impoverish his teacher.
I knew that he was alive only when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of Georgia ’ s coming Boris Marino.
Georgia does not like to see the picture, and we are in the books at home.
I understand this, but I also think that, thanks to this picture, people around the world feel our pain.
Georgian today says, "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People repeatedly examine such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they are exploring the collapse of this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can not understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, don't you want a war, so how?
Ten years are not at all with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget little about it.
It has attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares about the siege, but then got better.
I went to school later in 2004 and feared every day.
I thought of my friends and class cameras who had been killed.
That is why I am always in sports when September 1 comes closer.
I want to take my old childhood friends a toll.
It is hard for me to go to sports, but I have to do it.
I do not feel sacrifice; that story is now part of my past.
I won ’ t forget it, but I don ’ t like it.
My life continues.
I completed school this year and visited a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first election was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health could not be allowed.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won ’ t happen.
Georgia ’ s Faniyev, 20
The Young, who survived, though trapped in the feet of a murderous terrorist
One wonder: Georgia ’ s Faniyev was trapped in the doorstep of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in sports, selling next to the bomb that was fortified on the mercy of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a wonder that he was not killed.
"We seem to have been yesterday," says Georgian, who, as intelligence officer, wanted to go to the FSB, but could not do so because of its health damage caused by the siege.
It is still with me, it is not what I have left behind.
I am older now, and people say that children can easily handle dire experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"I worked with psychologists in 2006 and felt better after that, but I can not forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005, the first and only time I went to sports.
I lost awareness.
I will never return to it, and don ’ t ask me to show you where I have heard in this famous picture.
Today, Georgia ’ s Faniyev survivors, with a photo in the hospital after the Laptop
My pain is tremendous, and I watch it with me every day.
My friends know that I don ’ t like to think or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
The body of me is good.
I should be careful about my wounded knees, but I can now go well.
But, because of my health, I could not study at the FSB intelligence agency in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have studied my documents, including the medical profession, and have replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the Tibetan Institute.
I have had two years behind me.
He learned the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I knew I would never report my children to my experience.
Children should know nothing, and, of course, they should not suffer.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will commemorate the celebrations.
I know that Georgia will not go away.
It must be far more severe for him, because he was and I was not there.
I waited and could not help at home.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, where everyone is recorded in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgian is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept this when something such an unfair happens.
He is a young, he may sports, but he can not participate because of his knees.
He has been multiplied, but he can not exercise.
I would say that he has crossed the horror to 50%, but that can never be overcome and forgotten.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, only reinforcing my pain.
I have lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart wins around the graves.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows that have never been cured again.
It is hard to accept that life will continue, even if you don ’ t want it.
I will never forget how my heart was coming in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world – wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I almost can not believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can we be fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many more killed.
If only we could attack and throw all of these rebels – as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajeva, 10
The Baby, so visible by a Special Operations squad
Talk: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special operating squad (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world kept its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried out from the Beslan in the poor of a Russian police officer.
The terrorists left them, but in their cruelty, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina, and their brother, Makhar, held back in school sports.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona ’ s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried, and has a small girl with his new wife, Alexiea, named after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, now a decade old, does not remember the siege and have grown to a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a phantastic father, and wants to save them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
They will understand why.

4 Tipps for Better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a water Point Shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cream like GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are about $300.
I have taken these photos in a family with several cameras, all available at less than $350.
Regardless of equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Take your equipment twice.
Even if you have a water camera, you are assured that the battery salt and other faculty are closed.
Think of your camera also of the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and Camcordes have scenes and inventories with which the time to optimize the feasibility time for the realization of underwater conditions.
And, before you get into it, consider how deep your equipment can be.
Some cameras are allowed for only up to 5, others to 50 or 60.
Consider our shopping leader and evaluations for digital cameras for traditional and water models.
Think of multiple images -- because many will not sue.
Potandt--Shoot-cameras typically do not have an LCD with which to compare images.
It is difficult to see this under water, even if you have an LCD, and the right appearance is a gamble.
So you are taking a lot.
If your camera has a rice mode with which a series of records are made with easily altered records, you use it.
Give you near the surface.
Light will be dramatically worse as you move from the surface.
So, if possible, you will remain on the surface if you make kicks in a pool, lake, or seabed.
This enables you to put more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Take up to the objects.
This is also a good advice to land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor.
It is particularly important to work with an Action-Cam: these devices often have a firm Christmas cellinse, which means you have to go sooner to your objects if they are to fill the entire screen.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in an organization as gigantic as the NHS.
As a consultative anew theorist, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the disease ’ s agony and the source of treatment.
His patient, he recalled, was an MI6-staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors care about diagnoses and diseases, while the stoppers are mostly preoccupied with something else: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I am not feeling," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty spotting up.
As he fought with the flash-like symptoms, he observed that he offered legal charges to his wife.
"I prefer everything right now rather than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business tour for a week, Lawson felt unusual and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to make a X-rays investigation of his breast.
Just two weeks ago, he had been in the French nightmare.
The result of X-rays was X-rays examination.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an ominous cancer that attacks the breast, that is, the lungs.
As with most cancer, the accurate trigger is usually difficult to identify.
For example, while some smokers are developing lung cancer, not all lung cancer diseases have been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbezzlement - contact with the fiber groundwork, once considered a "miracle" - that has been deemed fatal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbest, after all, is a product of the past.
The most dangerous Assttype was no longer used in Britain since the 1960 ’ s, when industry voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Even where he was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the steam, for example, plumber, construction workers, and advertising workers.
Today, he appears to be hardly worrisome as an industrial vehicle from another era.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a mesolato epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesotheliom than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as traffic accidents.
The UK ’ s Years of Mesothelic Disaster since 1980 and likely future deaths in the UK
The reason we are seeing the deadly impact now, though Asbest has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of aspirations have been banned), is that a mesotheliom has developed only after decades.
And the scourge of the memotheliom is not confined to former construction workers.
Asbest was, and is often still, in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn, and the business in which we buy.
And, therefore, Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial boundaries, professions, or age.
The privileged bases, from elegant purchasing houses in London to private schools, are not a safe haven.
Parliament buildings are assisted.
Hospitals, too, where we are supposed to become healthy, have already been identified as a starting point of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a plumber.
Indeed, he found it hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks as if there was plenty of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was alive for six years." He wrote. "
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors, and the Pformard - uses the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my retirees will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could answer this question, at least in part.
"Of the four doctors trained at the Guy's Hospital," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last to live."
How many of us will still suffer?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty% of mesothelioma diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still suffer?"
The UK ’ s leading expert at Mesotheliom, a professor, Julian Peto, believes that, between 1870 and 2050, when the Asbedev ideal in the United Kingdom is expected to stall, 90,000 of the disease will have died.
Most of them do not yet know that they will die.

A brief look at the acts of the courts, to which those affected often turn out for harm requirements, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelic boom is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Yanice Allen had occasionally exposed asbestows.
It worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department to two locations – one of them the flagship deaths in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her work at M & S.
Now it has two children in the 20 ’ s.
"Before that," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom; I didn't even know anything about asbestom.
I would never have thought that this would affect me once.
Few people know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestows not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word "assassination", a description of the fiery structure that makes the stuff resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysoftware, also known as white Asbest, is by far the most frequent asbestom in buildings today.
It was used for drivers, pedestrian sites, raw solations, seasons, even brakes in cars.
It is less lethal than other assassinations, but it is seen by the EU and the WTO as a "great risk of health" with possible death.
More dangerous, however, is the brown Asbest (Amosit) and the blue Asbest (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestom, and experts suspect that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high level of medology."
A staff of Marks and Spencer has been exposed to Alamy in Oxford Street ’ s Flagshipstore, London.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliomer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that its history is by no means unusual.
He has conducted a study of those who are portrayed as saying that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without a known exemption from work or at home was probably caused by contact in the environment."
Much of this contact is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
Nobody, it seems, can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who studied the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government may have been unwittingly exposed to the blow.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the Services and Red Guard were contaminated behind parliamentary exclusions with asbestos, whose deadly façade could be confused by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of parliament are often accused of focusing on their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorment of Parliamentary Working Services insisted that the West Minster Palace had preserved a "clean health tool," it is now undeniable that, after the general election of 2015, $1 billion of work must be raised to renovate the parliament, modernize electric installations, and remove the asbestom, and that legislators are likely to meet more in the nearby QEF than in the western Center.
The Godder report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the specific provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
Everything to do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old adventurism suspects that he was exposed to asbestom during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where assassination charges have been positive," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all places to which one worked, and to the data.
What he is still very reminiscent is the day in early December 2009, when he received a kind of fever.
He was 45, and was doing so late.
Suddenly, I had charities.
It suddenly came.
I felt terrible.
I believed that the journey to home would no longer be created.
As a physician, Abbott knew that the pain stemmed from breast accident that swept around his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelie.
He did not go to work a month.
Miraculous doctors made X-rays of his breast and used pleurakathesis to take liquid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
But his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports and intense attacks.
In 2011, a patient advised a similar symptoms of his practice, and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But now Abbott did not associate with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades old and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
Abbott ’ s state deteriorated again in September 2011, and his physician brought his CTscan and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera song was introduced into the caste between rivers and breast accidents.
I am an optimist.
I am simply going on, "he says.
Frankly, I had not worried so many at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was between Christmas and New Year, "I was told that it was Mesothelie."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott Termine had with Macmillan-nurses, one of whom recommended taking a lawyer.
Only now did he grasp the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that Asbest was widely shared, particularly in large public buildings where Red was often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings now suffer.
So Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in typical occupations.
The most dangerous roles of assassination in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the blow.
But many people who moved from one building to another in footsteps (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground chantines (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely contact with toxic substances.
It turns out that hospitals may have been life-saving to patients for several decades after the war, but are life-saving to treat doctors.
It is still being removed.
Students turned their beast burners to assisters.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, business, libraries, and towns, owing to his fabulous isolating and flattening characteristics.
Schools, too.
Indeed, many people may have had the first contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their bean burners on artists.
On Web sites, the issue of asbestos in schools is now often addressed.
Meanwhile, such innocent subjects have consistently included asbestows in our houses, such as football sites and shoots.
"It is an industrial gift that is contained in much of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a affected woman was the section of a garden boost in the 1970 ’ s.
So you are adapting your garden stations.
The effect of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to work," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noted that I could not focus on what I did.
I was in practice two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Na, yes, I will not see another Christmas fires.
The biggest difficulty was the change in perspectives from a doctor ’ s position to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to get with.
"It was very difficult to take everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor" for how long did I have? "
And I was given about 12 months to me.
I remember that I thought, "Na yes, I won't see another landmark.
That was then. "
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life-saving mechanism - the atrocity itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most of the cases of mesotheliom are caused by assassination contact.
Asbest consists of small-scale fathers.
When the asbestom is confused and the fathers are incarcerated, they can be stuck in a breast, the skin around the lungs.
Assisters irritate the breast and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhabited nadelFor-shaped assisters," Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiovascular physician who changed to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suggests is now ironically, a leading center in treating mesotheliom.
Bureaucrats knew Lawson, and treated some others, probably also exposed to the asbestom during her education in the hospital.
Once the ashes reach pneumonia, treasury tissue says, "the respiratory process marginalizes them where the skin is.
It is inherently invasive from the outset.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well for mesothelie.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly disputed.
Some say they are worth trying.
Treasuries agree.
"One can not carry out the crash," he says.
They do not come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer "does not speak very well on chemotherapy," the "effect shows," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-lasting survivors," says Treasuries.
But they are all dying in the end.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggles.
Having contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man and consultative office four years after his diagnosis.
"Hallo, Cancer Cancer," made him pleasant when he called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier, and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would take four months to extend his life by just one month.
"I was desperate;" he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed to "make things look in a somewhat more positive light."
According to the consultation of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiovascular specialist on the guy's speaker.
"We had an advantage by not having to be proven, I simply called and got a date," he admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a reference and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom-inherited diseases to perform the best treatments available.
But, if these treatments inevitably fail, many people face another financial concern – the future of the families that they leave.
So they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse, LP.
"It has been known since 1898 that Asbest is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960 ’ s is that it recognized that a very small burden was also a health risk.
And here, companies ’ negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy ’ s Hospital ultimately did their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "a full-fledged compensation," because Lawson could not be shown with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an assault contact on the Guy's.
But, after investigating his death, a spokesman of the Guy's confirmed that "the assisters were removed in the affected cell area of the 1990's."
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Escape
Indeed, it is a huge problem for mesotheliom-illnesses seeking compensation to attribute a company ’ s deadly assault contact or job – usually decades after the incident.
Many of its former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance coverage can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is time for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were significant new legislation this year, making it easier for mesotheliom-operators to sue compensation, even if their former employers can no longer be found.
The law established a $350 million fund, sponsored by the insurance industry, for all diagnosed after July 2012, to demonstrate contact but can not sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court could have admitted to them in a normal casualties process – about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelio operators that £350 million was a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers," he says, "and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not gone away, and that Mesothoma would have found firms and could normally sue them.
Mike Penning, then the labor and pension minister, admitted that the law is "not perfect."
But both penning and Morgan admitted that, given seven deaths, rapid action is needed daily.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothoma law last December.
At that point, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Professor for 19 months. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After their first deliberations, Lg-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasuries.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a tripling therapy that allows Long Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40% for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, the most important," says Abbott.
This is always seen in patients.
There is something to keep you going.
When you collapse, you will be worse off very quickly.
Graham Abbott was subjected to surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had undergone the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Diseases showed no sign of the disease.
Then, in March 2014, I had a scan.
There were several cancer flies around my breast.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Abbott was again subject to six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no longer a trail of tumors.
But the process is physically and psychologically intrusive.
They need to think of practical things - about which money, for example, when I am no longer, or of my wife, shows how the field job works.
If you get bad news, you become negative.
They must look ahead.
The father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin 14, is not always easy.
"This is difficult for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say, and how much.
When I was first diagnosed, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not become old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very healthy and unchecked.
She told her friends, and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must endure.
But such talks are not enduring for mesothesis, not a trap of hope for survival.
The disease (just as it is finally done for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.
The Body of Balanced Pharaons in Assistant Disease
Assisters used to reinforce cooking and promote greater heat.
The elders ’ Plinius describes Asbest.
A tissue was developed that it is not burning.
I have seen Serviks slaughter in cameras.
The use of modern commercial asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (including fines) and storage.
Major assassinations are opened in Canada and South Africa, and soon after in America, Italy, and Russia.
It is the ideal isolation for the steam engines and turbines of the industrial revolution.
Global assisting production rises to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential statisticians identify a premature death rate for those who work with asbestos, which no longer receive life insurance.
Nellie Kershav dies in rogue.
Dr. William Cooke says that "without any reasonable doubt, the main cause of death is in the lungs."
This is the first such case.
Kershav ’ s employer, Turner Bros Asbestos, does not accept liability.
It does not pay a damages.
Up ships are being constructed during World War II, one of the most lethal facilities with assisted contact.
The industry ’ s volunteer renunciation of the Import of Blue Asbest
A Court of Appeals confirms the first successful personnel ’ s compensation charges in Britain for contact with asbestos.
Global assisting production rises to more than 4,21,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
A health and security executive in the UK committed to licensing all firms working with asbestos.
Import and the use of blue and broken Asbest are legally banned in Britain.
Any use of asbestos is banned in the UK.
Britain ’ s Mesotho law is passed.
A compensation program of £350 million is announced.
Asbest is banned in more than 50 countries, but white Asbest continues to be used as cheap construction in many countries of the world.
Global production is about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses Hong Kong ’ s Right to Government Election; demonstrators provoke retaliation
On Sunday, despite increasing calls for democratic reform, China ’ s parliament decided to nominate candidates for the election in 2017 by Hong Kong ’ s electorate.
This effort is likely to fuel long-announced protests in Hong Kong ’ s business district, while activists set in motion planning and mobilizing it within a few hours of permission.
The decision by China ’ s People ’ s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to reject all non-pekingdoms candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," says legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to Hong Kong ’ s inhabitants.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the People's Congress Committee, said that approval of public nominations in the election to Hong Kong's government is too messy.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants elect the government by 2017.
China ’ s leaders presented Sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong ’ s citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that China ’ s leaders are firmly in the hands of a closely controlled nominated nomination committee.
Moreover, according to a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong ’ s largest and most publishing protests have taken place in many years.
Behind Hong Kong ’ s pro-democracy campaign, the Occupy Central Company Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to close off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday ’ s day, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in response to Hong Kong ’ s government headquarters within a few hours of the permission.
In the demonstration, organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience, and that they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
But they did not come close to showing seemingly to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online sharing, organizers shared that the movement "considered the occupation of central districts only as the last resort, an action to be taken only if all dialogue channels are exhausted and no other choice exists.
It is worth saying that all of the chances of dialogue are being exhausted today, and that the occupation of the central district will be definitive.
Hong Kong ’ s authorities have been preparing for Beijing ’ s announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were intensified on Sunday before the government buildings.
The unrest is aggravated by many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their town.
People ’ s move from the mainland intensifies competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is a growing fear that Hong Kong ’ s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement's demonstrations because they endangered business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests of which they speak could do great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they continue," said legal experts Regine Ip, who have long criticized the movement.
We do not want to fuel fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China ’ s state-controlled media also recently reported on democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on the electoral rights that included 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong ’ s voters.
In July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the region ’ s greatest democratic demonstrations.
The tradition of schooling in the US is now transferred to universities, where reshma is offered with the private airliner.
We are happy to respond to this demand and offer Britain ’ s first luxurious rice service to students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at university, the company also offers traffic topics such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martes, or McLars P1.
Herr Stewart also acknowledged that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative to students who otherwise would have to carry out their habits in a dangerously overblown car.
Together with our new VIF options, we are keen to ensure this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury.
A business-speaker said that no new book was yet in place, because services had just been introduced, but added that "students would report service in the next few weeks."
The company also acknowledged that, despite the benefits of $9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different from students ’ expectations and claims 10, 20, or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF can be made exactly that.
But the National Study Union criticized the service as being abolished.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said, "This offer seems entirely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis of livelihoods, as available financial support in the form of credit and scholarships does not keep up with sharply rising invoices for the simplest livelihoods before they can think of spending thousands of pounds on the same occasion as the arrival of the student ’ s home.
Feminists criticize race and police behavior to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air, selling "hands high, not shooting," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the slaughter of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in online discussion of white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist commentators place sex on the race to address reproductive rights and income inequalities.
But, while tensions in the Middle East increased and received attention around the country, Perez saw that white women ’ s answers turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women to the students on August 9, the personal essays came with titles like "thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman," and "Feminism is not just about the suppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find many people who are above the white and have privileges so highly classical," she said.
People felt pressured to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are, and because the situation in Ferguson is so racial that they must express it.
For English-professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed problems each day faced by black American women but not considered "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish a bit of noise on Facebook about me and my partners, and make 150 likes of everywhere," Mitchell said.
If I am concerned about how farmers are under siege in their own country, the silence is obedient.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public sphere?"
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women did not have the luxury of separating the issues of clean air; they live in combined reality every day.
Whereas white women now combine race and gender issues in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a female professor and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were mastered between 1865 and 1890, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to participate in history in justifying the library murder.
Hattery saw the division between white and black women at the point where white fighters analyzed the country in the late nineteenth century, such as Susan B. Anthony, and found that the fight for electoral law could succeed only one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to champion women's electoral law, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
If such things are remembered, one is aware of power why white women do not trust them.
We have not done our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize themselves against the lynchtom in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson -- police behavior, racial discrimination -- is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "caught up" with the problems with which black women have been standing up for generations.
"Wouldn't it be tolerable if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to fear control?" asked Mitchell.
Second generation feminists, who built their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to recommendatory resources, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Stein went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown ’ s shooting, publishing an inspired article by Rebecca Carroll, Guardian columnist, calling for more white Americans ’ protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent to the body -- and who are very different from the race in public opinion polls -- will lead to change."
Although it is a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on race are stunned in America.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother ’ s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, many feminists, including Gloria Stein, had their reactions.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem in pushing for the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unparalleled minority years on the country ’ s southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also gaining ground – this time as a women ’ s issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a review of the issue as a major women ’ s issue, they need only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find sustainable women's organizations," she said.
The "Pigs House" in Ipswich
The picture of a house that was selling was removed from real-estate brokers when it became clear that it had shown a big pump that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The liberating house has a battlefield, is in Ipswich on a private street, and is offered at $120,000.
The details included building the house ’ s home room, which included a pigs that his head had embarked on a sofa.
Real maker Connell said that pigs are the owner ’ s home owner.
"But the photographs were now misread," a spokesman of the company said.
In the House's exposé, Connell described the former House of Assembly as a "unique one-family hedge with a battlefield."
Although the broker has removed the picture from the Web site, advertising materials appear.
Housing sales were an interest in social media when some asked whether the pigs were included in the purchase price.
Harvard ’ s SWF City, Happing a New Millionaire
Harvard ’ s Lost Player this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving almost $1.1 million from loving on Saturday Day.
A Harvard newspaper kiosk for the second time in five years drew the jackpot in designing the first division, up from $1 million in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, has yet to be reported.
Lave owner Steve Forward said that the gain from conversation in the small city of the southwest of Perth was made.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite outraged.
We thought such a gain could happen.
Eight WA winners celebrated earnings in the first division last month, a suitable conclusion for a few lucky weeks for state players.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires in August, after a few in Belmont had gained $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The victorious few had played for twenty years, saying that the gain would allow them to be allowed to price and buy a new house.
Harvard ’ s millionaire is the 59th winner of the first WWA division this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonda asked to the Gladiatorial
Not only were the giants in the Matsch at the first Rome Day in the Friday park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract yesterday ’ s more than 1,000 visitors who defied the rainy and the heartfelt cold and were restlessly enthusiastic of the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful rice of images, exhibitions, games, exploration games, and information about the Roman era, and their relevance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian combat force of the "Amor Mortis School," which used every rainbow to demonstrate its robust combat credentials in the arena that presided with soft sand.
Gladiatorial owners "Leonida" turned out to be humorous and knowledgeable presentors, sending each other his men in the ring of heroic doubts in various gene evangelizations.
First, the "provocators" were the series of invoices and short screens, as well as those on the left and the poor on the right.
It followed the "Essedari" with breast screen, short sword, and worship, as well as iron Gladienhelm, Bein, and Armed Protection.
Most impressive was the arrival of the "Retiarius," which joined the root web, three-cack, and dolf against the "Secutor" and, after the recent fight, brought the Burden to the ground.
There, the heavy metallic scramble, the shootings, and the worms surmount through the arena that fear and bange could become the health of the gene.
But, to that, the impressive "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, "had an ever keen eye.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of raw time viable," says, Euscirchen, Chairman of the chairman of Römerkanal. "
After two years of preparation, the leisure park became an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage observed in his phrase.
After all, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous construction that we still admire.
They were also amazed at the Rome Day, such as "Aquedukt-Marmor," of the eleven meters of high and 1400 meters of raw canal bridge that was once in liver telberg.
The frontline society once and now confronted energy supplies, and business leader Petra Fricke knew that "We still benefit from the knowledge of the day."
This also confirms diploma measurement genius Ralph Heiger of the "engineering two" of Rheinbach, which presented racial measurement tools such as Chorobat, Groma, or Dioptra.
The Römerville villa in Blankenkenheim presented sticks and models of the 1894 expiration anno, as well as brick stones from the Original Hypocausta, the warmly deforestation that once caught the Römervilla.
Pressuingly, the footsteps left by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago were left in the footsteps of the tone before they were burned.
In 2011, the post of mineral health at the Rhineland Association of Rheinland had burned the remnants of a Roman villas in the Nord Commerce Tax in Rhinbach.
They have found transformational walls of an economic building with a pipe for drifting grain and painting.
The building probably had been a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity, explained Dr. Jennifer Morning.
A number of glass vessels from these exits put them in a glass vitrine, including a large stone, several bad fiber vessels, and parts of a cigarette hallmark.
The Villa may have existed from the first to fourth century to Christus, until the disappearance of Germania in the then Roman Rhineland, suspects Morning.
They also engaged in the Roman wind game, similar to today ’ s millennia gamble, or wrote their names with metal attack on their peers.
At the level of the beast thermal, the children were allowed to use mosaics themselves, burst at the level of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach Glasmosaics, and, at the level of the egg of the Evil Base ’ s egg Base of Natural Hood, a severe steel vessel to put the meter for a floor a bowl.
With the original Roman rice car recorded by two cold thugs, visitors went through the leisure park, overturning the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Römer Village."
With a smoke week on September 13-21, the city of Weiberg, too, will enter the cleverly expanded village of 2014, which is supposed to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Along with the home and history associations, and the warning consultants, the Partnership, and the Laily Games of Upper Game, such as mathematical migrations, a lecture, cooking, and leadership of school-class classes, and W8 in the Roman past, will be remembered.
In the process, for example, a Roman legionaire will be told by his work on the accessible watchdog, presented plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and offered a smart classroom for international understanding between a group of guards and admitted races.
Adendorkovsky ’ s primary school is devoted to the issue of race in a project week.
With the spotlight, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Weiberg are being reinvented.
A small presentation will be remembered in the guard of Rathaus, the Ecumber Matrona Fund, in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Burdens West Africa ’ s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are wasteful – and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic deals a severe blow to West Africa ’ s economy.
The harvest is eradicated to fields that are minutes, and markets waste – the virus has taken a heavy toll on the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia ’ s Hardest Imperative
"It is a total disaster; we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia Kleight.
In the market, only who wants to buy food or something to disinflate Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, where more than 600 people were killed to fever.
Recently, health officials said that the disease was broken in every corner of the country.
Likewise, the virus has spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
Overall, more than 1,500 people died, and thousands more were already alive.
Foreigners from Foreign Companies
Everywhere in resource-rich countries, firms operate.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, withdraw their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly the affected regions.
Domestic traders and farmers are also responding: few merchants leave their homes to buy them.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia under quarantine territory, such as the coa and coffee reefs that are important for exporting are rampant.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food Next
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris experts on West Africa's economy.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his mood is preferable to stay home.
The population therefore feels the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is scarce.
In the markets, the Council of Basic Foods, such as Rice, is disappearing.
At the same time, the region that relies heavily on international firms threatens to create an image scourge, with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international firms are fundamentally avoiding the area for a long time, Philippe Hugon of the French Tank Iris think.
What is essential is how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression that "it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia," Hugon warns.
The Disease also encumberes states ’ strained budgets
The disease also strains the states ’ already strained budgets.
The ratings agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by high health-care spending, as well as by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help countries ’ health-care systems of $60 million ($45 million).
The impact is already evident in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
While the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people remain at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels, too, are falling sharply.
Savings celebrate their 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" of Berngau celebrates his 50-year-old founding.
High towers are preparations for the 50-year-old founding of September 12-14.
The plan is a major entertainment with the "village frocker" group on September 12.

On the afternoon, the distribution of the federal and Gauck shoots is also the prize.
A particularly beautiful sight sight will be the 25 festivals with their brakes.
The blackmail cup is Berngau.
The patronage has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Foracker.
The original term "Tannenwald Berngau," originated in 1907, when "social entertainment was established by exercise in cigarette and small-scale shoots" on March 21.
The NS regime had triggered the unification in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men, who, on April 30 in the hospital of Luka, lifted the "new" shooting company "Tannenwalwald" Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the verdict as a protector ’ s champion through a difficult initial time, mainly about finding a single location and installing the shale business.
As early as the fall of 1965, the "Leininger" of the hosts began in the hospital with two teams in the ruin walls.
In subsequent years, sports protections, now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to one Gaullilia.
The corpse corresponds fell apart every year, and the magic limit of 380 battles was reached by Rudi Maer for the first time in 1980.
Just as the performance of active protectors has increased, so, too, have membership performed positively.
After the "Leininger" has stopped claiming a modern patronage unit, Johann Rinn's then board, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future edifice in the cellrooms of the "landmine" of the new "home.
After working on May 8, 1988, 1988, Pfarrer provided the Kircheric blessing for the new shoots.
One of the great heights in United States history was certainly the 44th Gauck shoot, coupled with the solemn marriage of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the user agreement celebrated its 30-year-old founding jungle.
In 1995, a BOil Group was established.
Joseph Schmalzl became a mercenary referent.
A major challenge for the "mercenaries," and for the whole, was to organize the Bavarian Boil Games in 2005.
In many hours of honorable work, last year ’ s members have upgraded the trees and the Bernauer Hof ’ s blackmail facility, bringing it to its latest level of technology.
Elf Teams in Rundening Battle
There are also the convenience of the Mupper Alliance.
Overall, eleven teams participate in rainfall battles: six air-defense teams, an air pistol team, a sports pistol K1, a youth and two AHI teams.
The 1. Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi degrees, and Kerstin Kellermann rose to the Divisional League 1 in the round of 2013/14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann, and Tobias Graml has moved from the Gaullilia Nord to the Gaullist League.
Aside from the sport, events such as bocksteel, fascination, and royals, have flourishing, and Christmas celebration.
In doing so, the shoots are also at the feast of Pfarrei and the community.
Tony Stewart has accidents in Return to the Race
Tony Stewart ’ s return to the race, for example, ended halfway through his race on the Atlantic Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the Wall for the second time after his right-wing manifestations burst into Round 172 and ended his dinner.
Stewart took his damaged car to the garage, leaving it without talking to journalists.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that his 14-member team is disappointed, but now focuses on the race on the coming weekend in Jmond, Virginia.
"I wished that we had a better use and better outcome for him," Johnston said.
We drive in the direction of the month, hoping that we can do better.
Stewart was already entering a wall on Sunday ’ s race after a collapse with Kyle Busch, and had to repair the right side of his guard.
"I have gone to a good outcome today," Johnston said, adding: "It simply didn't have been charged."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart ’ s car was invited to the slump, and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup, after his car met and killed another ride in a New York Aleksander Rule in the north.
He decided to return this week, either in Atlanta or in the next Judmond race, to gain a place in persecution.
He returned to his job during an investigation to the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevard Ward Jr., who had stepped on the way during a race to face stewart.
The authorities shared on the Friday that the investigation of the accident will last for at least two weeks.
There has been no choice yet about whether Stewart must expect a charge.

Bulgaria ’ s Prisoners protest nationwide
Hundreds of people from across Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoring their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of formulas to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month, demanding a return to the earlier 24-hour classes.
Despite the prison workers ’ meetings and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) was reported.
Negotiations last, the Director-General for Punishment, Rsen Zhelyazkov, shared the BNC.
The protest of prison workers is likely to be supported by members of the trade union of interior ministry employees.
Refusing Luhansk ’ s Airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russia fighters remain on the march.
Today, after grave fighting, supposedly involving Russia ’ s pandemic battalion, the Ukrainian army, Monday, has abandoned the airport of the rebel high Luhansk.
The army also reported that seven soldiers had been killed over the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already had personalized consequences from his army ’ s severe defeat in the fight against separatists, and had announced changes in the top army ’ s leadership without calling details.
Prorussian separatists Shot Airplane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, anti-Russian separatists have again shot off a combat airliner and two military helicopters after their own account.
Roughly 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents on Monday shared Russian agencies.
Lowering Coastal Whales
The insurgents also claimed that, for the first time in the Soviet Sea, two armies of Ukraine ’ s coastal guard had been slashed.
Ukraine ’ s border protection confirmed that two of its vessels had been under attack near the port town of Mariupol on Sunday.
Yet seven border defenders were injured, a spokesman in Kyiv told the station 112.
Two members of the occupation were missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
Separatists also reported that they had brought several orders to control in Donetsk.
The Diplomacy of Diplomacy in Minsk
Today, the Ukrainian contact group is meeting in Belarus ’ s capital, Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia, and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the run-up to it, all actors used their appearances to announce their demands publicly.
NATO ’ s Don ’ t Break Agreement with Russia
NATO will not break its deal with Russia, owing to the Ukrainian crisis, as planned deployments in Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO abides by the 1997 NATO-Russia Council ’ s founding agreement.
But the NATO leader accused Russia of "a big break" of the agreement.
"Today, we must face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen argues.
Russian documents and statements show that "they view us as opponents."
Stronger NATO Secret
Race has also announced that NATO ’ s presence in Eastern Europe will be strengthened.
A "Readiness Action Plan" adopted at the NATO summit in Wales would ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on New Gas Talks
Russia and Ukraine are reported to have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are set for the coming Saturday, said Russian Energy Secretary Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It would still be waited for a European Union decision to see whether it is also a representative of the talks.
Ukraine has not been receiving a fuel from Russia for weeks, owing to disputes over the price of gas.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut gas supplies for Europe.
Europe derives about one-third of its gas from Russian sources, much of which flows from Ukraine.
Merkel speaks to power: You will be "clear."
Now the Chancellor is clearly committed to this.
But it is not a free pass for all of the complicated details.
CSU persistent concerns about the PKK skin have become increasingly acute.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a term for the introduction of a PKK skin after continuing resistance from her CDU.
"To be clear, it is up to the coalition treaty, and it will come," the party leader said in the month after meetings of the CDU ’ s top bodies in Berlin.
But Merkel did not have a detailed model for the time being.
The black Red Government Program calls "certain parameters."
German Minister Aleksander Dobrinkmanship (CSU) has "made a proposal, and it is now going to work."
The NRWC CDU, however, insists on its No to a movie on all roads.
Merkel emphasized that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was constructively involved in consultations for a bill.
Beyond the subject, he spoke with Dobrindt about more opportunities to activate more private capital for infrastructure investment, including broadband.
"There is nothing special about it." Schäuble had left an "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday's day, his house examines his own concept to pay for highway investors with monthly revenue after the election of 2017.
CSU Chairman Horst Seehofer warned of developing motto concepts in the cabinet against the senior minister.
CDU ’ s Armin Laschet, a CDU, affirmed his objections.
"The coalition treaty never stopped writing all circle and federal roads," the North American CDU chairman said.
To this extent, it is an important signal that maritime workers have now announced that they are talking again about the issue.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU ’ s associations of Baden-Valttemberg and Rheinland.
The background is fear that a mosquito impairs the small border traffic with neighboring states.
Seehofer had demanded coalition aspirations because of the college ’ s assassination critique.
The left regards plans as failing, given the Union ’ s dispute.
"The Murder skin is dead," Party Chairman Bernd Riexinger said of the "New Osnabis newspaper."
"The minister's mind fails," Dobrint wants to introduce a ventilation on all German roads to start in 2016.
Domestic auto owners, according to the coalition treaty, must not be added to the burden.
So they are supposed to get a full balance over the Kfin tax.
But, according to EU law, foreign drivers can not disadvantage because of their nationality.
Genetic Disorder is often Misdiagnosed
A Britin says she thought she would die for many years as a result of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that they had only a few years to live after diagnosing another disease.
Indeed, it suffered from the Charcot-Marfe-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that harms nerves outside the brain and the back-market.
Charity CMB said that misdiagnosis is a common problem with people with CMT because so little about the disease is known.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscular weakness, an uncertain move, and screaming.
The disease is ominous and progressive, which means that symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from a grave ataxy (FA) – a disease with very poor prospects for survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the roles before she would be 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are now 51 years old said, "As a child I knew I could not do the same thing as the other.
I steadily fell, and everything lasted for me.
I could never travel with the other children Rollschuh or Skateboard, and was often left in school for my way and was obeyed.
Rodgers said that, at the age of 13, she saw her hospital records as her doctor left the room and slaughter that she suffered FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I had told no one, but I went home, looked at the disease at the library, and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I was asked, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought I would be 18 in the rollout and die by 25, and would slowly lose all of my capabilities.
I did everything with me alone, planning my own funeral.
She said when she became 17, she understood that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He was simply standing up, impoverishing me, saying, "My love, I don't think you hate it, or you are already in a rollback."
I believe you hate something far less life-threatening.
Some genetic tests found their CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt that I was a guess," she said.
Charity CMUK has launched a CMT-Awareness month to pay attention to this disease.

The Inevitable Tax Burdens of Business in Washington
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax modes for domestic companies rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, a newly published study last week showed no exception to Washington.
District, Maryland, and Virginia combined paid $27.6 billion in government and local governments in 2013, a 3.8% increase in revenue of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The company ’ s government and local tax burden rose by 4.3% last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% in the previous year, and it was the third year in the aftermath of the declines in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes increased by 4.3% more than local taxes, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young, with the center for government taxation, a tax group.
More than half of the District ’ s tax revenue, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Maryland ’ s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia, at 28%, gets the smallest tax revenue from business.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate real-estate values, according to researchers, which led to a 3.7% increase in real-estate taxes this year, with growth rates of less than 1%, following the three consecutive years.
While much of these gains were derived from large states, such as California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to be at work for Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – a 4.2% increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent rebound in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenues, as real-estate taxes are close to one-fifth of the tax rate of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D. C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"Much of the real estate is happening in Maryland, particularly in the area of DC, either owned by the government or by non-real-estate profit organizations," said Douglas Lindholm, the Center on State Taxation CEO.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states provide.
The Recent Corporate Recovery of Tax Recovery
Corporate revenues also seem to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported $2.3 billion in income taxes among state organizations, compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
As the trend moves in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase the same way in all three places.
The rate of appreciation in the district was 4.3% the national average, while the rise in Maryland was much higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a 4.1% subpar tax revenue.
Virginia, at 6% in all three pages of government, has much lower corporate income taxes (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate-tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, and a disproportionate 9.975%.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local corporate taxes are required, and overall a better fiscal climate than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina enacted legislation to reduce corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the government continues to meet its income targets next year, the law could reduce the government ’ s corporate-income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in Washington seem to be doing better, so they pay more government and local taxes, the latest study argues.
Corporate taxes, paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure for which most small businesses are organized - grew by 20% in the District, Maryland, and Virginia, to $2.4 billion last year, a much faster rate of growth than total corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes around the country is likely to last this year, with increased government and local governments ’ tax revenue increased by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 relative to the same period of earlier this year.
Yet the space of Washington could backfire if the federal government ’ s spending cut affects the region ’ s labor market.
Partnership: German Bies for Guangzhou
Hopes and Malz - a popular combination in China, too.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt ’ s Chinese partner now wishes a beauty, and also hopes for a direct airline connection between the two cities.
Germany ’ s beer, used in Frankfurt ’ s Guangzhou partner, is the urgent desire of Chinese officials.
"We would please ourselves very well if a German beauty were left down in our town," said Vice Party Secretary Li Yiwei of the South China Metropolis, this week in a visit to his town of SPD delegation.
Time and again, the official of China ’ s ruling Communist Party resigned during the conversation on this issue of coercive million-metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called Kanton in Germany, is one of China ’ s richest cities, Li warned.
As a result, people have the purchasing power to afford German bees.
Hispanic SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer Gümble, who led Germany ’ s political delegation, told the host that he would hear in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for Bier: good water, grain, and lifelong pleasure," he added to the party ’ s chief in Guangzhou in lunch.
His lifelong pleasure is already broadcast by Mr. Li, flattering the host.
In response, Guangzhou ’ s official arrived with Schäfecta, but with rotwine that was used to eat.
The Chinese brand of Tsingtao goes back to Germany ’ s beast.
Tsingtao beer is used according to the German cleanup offer.
More Business Traffic
A second desire by China ’ s host would be a fluid direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice Party leader Li said.
The Lufthansa had offered the curse earlier, but in 2012, it was for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," local politicians turned out to be convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities is widening."
Currently, travelers would have to take the way around Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The management of Guangdong province, whose capital, Guangzhou, is also hopeful for the airline.
The province ’ s Vice Governor, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gülen, the Chinese Vice Secretary Li Jinjun, an intimate Kenyan, replied nowhere.
Trained Partnership
Guangzhou ’ s shining Vice Party leader hopes that he can visit Frankfurt as a partner meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not in that function.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor was promoted for corruption charges.
Wan Qinglian, the local leader, also had to go.
The operation against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the Party and the administration, which Xi Jinping harshly enforced.
Li Yiwei, the new leader, worked before his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was the top official in Fujian, where the automobile VW is building a major work.
Frankfurt has officially done more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000-kilometer Guangzhou is one of those who are cultivated by both sides, such as a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis at the perller stream are almost as strong as their economic power.
Next year, it wants to achieve €250 billion of GDP, Li reported.
The Family of Joan Rivers "Put the Daums
Joan Rivers has been conscious since her delivery to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian has recovered from her disease.
"Thanks to your ongoing love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a division.
We are all pushing the dust.
According to her mother, after an emergency at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, on the Donor Day, she was placed into Mount Sinai hospital after a heart attack.
Physicians deliberately hold them sixth, and with close scrutiny until they are more satisfied with their state of affairs, which remains described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of an overwhelming online outlook by Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental Dauters and Rising Wages
For cars and steel dumbers that are still trading, stricter environmental standards will be applied in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new steel dumbers from September 1 th receive a label whereby the buyer can see key data on a view of the energy efficiency of the equipment.
New cars apply to the raw fuel class, "Euro 6."
There are also more money for equipment: they receive a federal minimum wage of €10.25.
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on the morning day: the online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - buys the video service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to take over, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if selling Twitch to Google ’ s video service was a cool billion, and cooperation seemed natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as a Justin.ttv, was launched as a general student service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players seeking to publish their brain games in games, an insider said.
Twitter sites.
And "let's play," a video video in which better wiser gives the (usually older) games a strike of secret scientists, is already popular with YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken a bit away, a textbook example of a established engineer who buys a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube was not created, because the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know about now is Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community that they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there more quickly."
Another secret, frankly, is Twitch ’ s unbelievable success.
Snobs like me, who declare that they prefer to sports rather than watch, is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes that others are watching in the game, rather than taking control consols.
It is one thing to look at the shoulders at a friend at 3 a.m., while it is slightly smart by Resident Evil, and another to watch a spinner in how he is shot at one another 20 times in Call of olly.
All of these games could now be seen.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are now Ego-Games, so, without their own control of the perspective, commitment may be a correct recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast patterns in which the Red Bannisters of our electronic age are complementary in record-high times.
But, so long as it is not a game or human virtual, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month, and is the fourth largest source of Internet transportation.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant video as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are promoted as advertising.
As Twitch ’ s leader, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch, both believe in the future of gaming, "and the medium shows no sign of shrinking, not even swallowing, as a viewpoint.
Much was lost on Sunday ’ s linchburg at the Burggard Start.
The predecessors ’ concept voted.
Despite the strong rainfall committee on Saturday, an estimated 1,200 music fans were in the Burggarten.
At times, it had to be stopped.
"This was angry," Ron Sem, one of the organizers said.
Saleh ’ s purpose is light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sakharov and Ron Sem formed Amula.
For the opera Air in the salt of Burggarten is meant to broadcast heroism the day and evening by Shodiverse.
Na, and the pleasure comes by itself.
This was already evident in the early Sunday, when the first visits to the Open Air appeared.
A test for all generations had promised organizers.
And they have.
Around the supply of the Burggarese, it had been fatigue for salesspeople, but also for guests from nearby and more.
They watched the first life appearances, swept with the pact, enjoyed bold beaches - in short, relaxing pure and enjoying.
And that is more comfortable through generations.
While the one strandable white sand, on cap on the extra white sand, was flourishing in the Vinothek, the offspring died on the hill, a major makeover for the smaller guest.
But, even in childhood shuttle, volunteer workers really had their hands to do all their hands in order to become a master ’ s request and cry imaginative creations in the small faces.
The bigger were used by the kickbacks or participating in a sateboat shop that the Goodfoot Crew set out of Salvation.
Until the big rains came.
Shortly before 17,30, he boasted down to visitors, especially families.
But the mainstream ’ s attractiveness did not.
"There were more people than expected," Ron Sem said, "success on the whole."
So there is nothing wrong with a repeat of the big party next year.
While the content and size of the evasion has yet to be worked, in a first balance sheet on Sunday on the popular vote, he made clear.
As an illumination, he called that it had to be stopped interim.
Obviously, too little force had been given to the security firm.
As a result, some who had already paid stopped coming to the ground.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious assessment, the Salvation purposes spoke of some 1,200 visitors who were in the Burggarten.
There were problems with tea techniques.
Thus, the Saleh Hip-Hop-Band Block's ``next-door'bloc broke out.
Technicians were unable to create a semi-sensible sound.
The planned Shisa Lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to the salt for a rice.
"Next year, they will be," the CEO said.
The Amula Open-Air premiere had more than succeeded from visitors.
And that is true for bad weather.
But the predecessors have made some mistakes that will be made for the first time, but that must be eliminated in the second edition.
Facebook, too, must be criticized in the social networks of Facebook.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier speaks on the occasion.
"You, sadly, have taken you a bit in the same place," says Ele Zimmermann.
Others do not see the initial problems so narrow.
I find it very good that some not only are stupid, but also really try to put things on their feet.
Hard! "Stephanie Jench writes to Amula.
Now it is a year for the executives to dismiss these criticisms.
The New Rome in the Members: Weiberg ’ s Truth Mirror
This is not expected to happen.
Instead, the ready building part waits to be used in the married construction plant.
The move is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the TIRA was established, the shell, the so-called radio, will be fully renewed.
The new radio will be slightly smaller than the old.
But size remains a world record.
The Last Step to Complease the New Hell
The upper quarter of the old hill will be separated and taken off with a crack.
Then, the last quarter of the new hill will be raised.
Unless the weather plays in, action should be taken to the stage at the beginning of this week.
The Ice-Buck Challenge Gaps
Isabelle Robert of Britain written so much when her idle water was swept over her head that she violated her face ’ s bone structure.
The Ice-Buck Challenge was sorely wrong.
A woman was sent to the hospital, having so much praised at the Ice-Buck Challenge that she was exploiting the brick.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom was so grappled when her idle water was swept over the head that she violated her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I wrote, and, while I did, my coffee remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Iron water is wasted by the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts Before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn ’ t happen, the clothing was hated, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this, and almost stood in the hook before laughter, but I had to take the emergency.
Britain ’ s 20-year-olds were sent to the hospital to allow the coffee to return after participating in the viral trend on the service day.
The Clip became an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are burglers about to return to one strike?
Finally, there has always been a division between the two cloud houses of Burgus.
Now board boards are considering possible cooperation.
The late Richard Dimbath, a former chairman of the cloud house of Burg, led the project in the French guédelon as a role model as a model for rebuilding the late Richard Dimbath, a former chairman of the Wolwoler ’ s Burgfreer house.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the burqa and the Burmese cohorts.
Specifically, the points so far seem to be how to deal with the story of Burg ’ s cloud houses and possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving together: talk about joint action should soon be conducted.
This confirms the United Nations Board of Torsters Sjöberg and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreer) for our newspaper ’ s demand.
"I have called Mr. Piffl, proposing that we could join us," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both clues could regain momentum.
For example, it has had more visible successes.
Whereas the Burgund-Friends of the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until recently saw reconstruction of the Burg in the mountain forest, the Sjöberg Burgein is the "development and permission" of the Yellow.
Herbert Piffl, the chairman of the Burgfriend round, has been very happy, according to his own words, about the call.
Since Dimbathi ’ s death, he has been on the front lines of the burgeoning.
A new chairman is said to be found in a member assembly in mid-September.
Currently, according to the 74-year-olds, there are about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially abandoned union activities for respect," a "mindset" that was needed to "consider how to continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman is said to be in the conversation with the burqa.
Until then, the BurgFriends could also be a current image of mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself"; he does not want to run for himself because he has his house in Bad Toz.
The new chairman should be a cloud house.
The tariff wants to "but very much work on the project."
The different locations in reconstruction are likely to persist in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He portrays Dimbath as a "missionary" that always believed in rebuilding the Burg.
Two similar, already-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a luster.
They are a tourist magnet through high participation and voluntary aid from around the world.
Piffl: "I, too, was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have come to believe more and more that it makes sense to advance the project, "creating a" single attitude "for the first-place city.
There is nothing else.
Moreover, the project would be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets, and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I don't want to give up your idea of reconstruction personally," he hopes that there is something going on.
"It is important and good."
After that, one could continue to see.
A Clever Path to Save on Unity Teachers
Given that the cost of universal textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fastest-secondary student Matt Schroeder turned out to be a clever saving ideal.
He found a bodyguard system for students of higher semester, offering nominal compensation to delay sales.
"My mathematics book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-movie cemeal," Schroeder said, 19 who visited Georgia's Covenant College.
He said the books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430.
He spent $120.
College guidance told them that students spend more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and student material on average, but that there are various cost supplements for students.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution to the election.
The rent of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than in purchase.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university centers, shared that the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books had been mixed in college letters last spring, Neebos Vice President Tean Meyer said.
Less than half of textbooks are bought in Campus, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the single one for the best deals.
Buying Online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore.
Nine editions of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler cost almost $290, but can be received by the specialized textbook maker Chepossibly .com for $239.99.
Business Needs
If you don ’ t make the notes of other or normal consumption, needed books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have chemist.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a final student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 Cents on Amazon.com 42 on "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of Advertising Business."
The book was re-sold for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, Chairman of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors whether earlier spending is permitted.
Sometimes, the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be acquired for a fraction of the cost of the latest spending.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to needed books.
Race
The rent of textbooks is worth considering if you want to treat them reasonably well, reject them, and you don ’ t want to keep the books after the price is concluded.
They can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly bought book.
A student, for example, could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Consider the regulation of the business in which you rent, including the penalties that may come from writing noise, entertainment, or usage.
I fit: if you don ’ t give back the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books, rather than traditional textbooks, are also an option.
Sometimes, these books are de facto mixed, providing an electronic license for a particular period of trade such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that in literature courses, students often find the best offers, because many classics can be invited free nowadays, while science and inexperienced textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, I look at it.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, because one can be so sure that the right textbook can be found.
And, according to Gault, one should examine whether the book is actually present.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that four weeks had supply and finally paid the full price in the college accounting camp.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not get a casualties strike
"The Expendables 3" of Sylinvester Stallon played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill for" played just $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The "Sex Tape" film, promoted by Cameron Diaz, played a mere $14.6 million on the opening week, while children films like "Drawing Tape" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the children ’ s films may be the reason for themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for child movies, describing "dragmas easily made 2" purely "functional" fishing.
But film films for a slightly older target appear as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic assessment to every summer movie start shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and this year to at least 2,000.
The results rely on the opinion of the child ’ s visitors and film critics, pointing out that this year ’ s film hits are equal to those of the past year.
Some commentators argue that development stems from changing sewage habits and the growing popularity of web-sharing services such as Netflix.
RegDirector Jon Favreau, who is now working on Disney's soon appearance of Jungle movie, told the website of Hollywood reporters, "I believe that times change."
We must accept this, not try to go down to the past.
In contrast to the current weak casualties of Hollywood products, net flix recently reached $1.2 billion in sales with diversification content, almost twice as much as it did last year, in which sales were $837 million.
Last summer, the director Steven Plaberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on movies of Comics and predicting a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy may well contain a true core.
But other film officials are more optimistic about the potential casualties expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic World.
The manufacturer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the recent decline in casualties as simply "cyclical," saying to Hollywood reporters: "Next summer will be the biggest summer of the Child Chamber, and no one will worry about business."
This has been a step in the right direction a few years ago, when the 2 Tibetan district classes were slashed in order to punish ligene-sharing.
Now the German tissue Association has launched an additional 31st federal League.
As a result, those who did not rise have declined.
For example, Götine ’ s most classic team, Torpedo, has avoided the demise in the upper ligade, but only five-tier in the coming season.
Fourth, torpedos remain the seeds, despite their grandiose breakthrough into the regional League.
Torpedo ’ s boys and girls died in the slaughter, as did the SC ’ s boys.
The SG Lengines and the Torpedo-Reserve are in the new Association League, in which no gods are represented.
On the seeds, TV plays Geismar in the Association League, the Torpedo branches in the national League.
What looks like a better circular class is now the new district hole of south.
Here, TSV seats, VFB lions, torpedo III, Geismar, Einbear, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Long Challenges, the FC is essence, and the TC.
In the district League, as regional representatives of the Dransfeld and the SC, the TTC II district class, Rot Weite, the Bovender SV II, and the TV-TV Geismar II and III teams are at least beginning to play in school.
Günter, the TC, and the TV of Geismar II are the game here.
In the district League, Torpedo III and Sattenvs/Whall shoppers run out.
The Nine Teams
The SC weather sends its girls to the small district league.
Nor is the SCWC ’ s district staffle, including Torpedo II, launched.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende, and Bovender SV go to season.
In the first season of the newly established governing body, the two guest women carriers died with nine teams.
In the West Staffle, Red Weite II, Bovender SIII, Laubach II, Torpedo IV, and V, MTV Grone, Dransfield, SC II, Mielenhausen, and SG Lengauer II.
In the East Staff, for example, screens/wood shops, Nikolausberg, and landlords play.
The Dame Circuit is composed of screens/wood shops II, television shops, hunts, seulting II, Tuspo Weende, and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of East Time, where there are no dam teams at all at the crop level.
What is striking is that none of the sixth circle should be achieved, where the innovative and circular boards will have to be thought again.
NATO ’ s Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the center of Newport into an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff before the city ’ s town thals to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has traveled to us on weekend, talking to protesters who traveled to Belgium from Britain.
Emerging Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
ZWEI youthful buyers were safe with the silk winds after capturing the night over the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke to their town shortly after Sunday in Govett ’ s Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives spoke about 20 a.m., when the two had not returned home.
An addiction of local police and bailout services broke down, and the couple was found at about 23 a.m. near the Bridal Veil.
The girl had violated the knees, and the man had overthrown and beaten his head.
Bailowers stayed at the couple overnight, and were fired tomorrow on Monday.
They were provided with a hospital to Mountain ’ s Blue Hospital.
Escalating Pakistan ’ s Anti-Government Protests
About 1,000 protesters were pressured by soldiers from the PTV buildings, said Pervaiz Rashid.
The station has resumed radiation after a half-hour.
PTV-Director Athar Farooq said that the protestors executed with sticks had damaged devices in the edition.
Death or injuries were not reported.
The protesters are calling for the government ’ s resignation, which they accuse of electoral fraud.
The police said that roughly a kilometer away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence had come with security forces on Monday.
After hospitals, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed on weekend, and more than 500 were injured, when protestors tried to push ahead with Sharia ’ s residence.
They call for the prime minister ’ s resignation.
The powerful military called on Sunday after a meeting in the army headquarters to seek a political solution to the conflict "without time to waste and use without force."
"The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
escalating violence has stoked concerns about military intervention, which has already become more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and Premier Tahirul Qadri have lasted since independence on August 14.
Sharif opposes resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to stay up.
"We will not leave without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning last May ’ s parliamentary election through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
A transitional government will then reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government ’ s fourth.
The protestors had initially slaughtered peacefully before the parliament, until Khan and Qadri called them to advance Sharia ’ s residence on weekend.
Happends after second seasonal victory in three of the tables.
At 2: 0, a bitter week has come to an end on Sunday for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," trainer Zoran Barisic said, whose team had reached a license with the European League on the Thursday.
"The success experience was vague," confirmed Capitals and Torturers Steff Hofmann, who took three place with Green Christmas.
Srammel mourning has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with a success experience in the country ’ s interplay.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said outsiders Thomas Schrammel, who, with his masterful sixteenth-day leadership check, put his way to victory in the 14th minute.
"I thought I hate the entire frenzy of the Donbas Day," said the 26-year-old smiling.
This was still for Ried when the last screen hit in a federal bond article on August 13, 2010.
Thus, the first championship in the Rapid Dress will be special in memory.
"For me, this is a bit more special; I am from the rubber offspring," he said.
Mario Pavelic ’ s short-term bestbestselling of Mario Pavelic brought screens from the left to the right side of the defense, and made his cause very good.
He has enough experience that he can reflect this position.
He deserved that he had already accomplished some assists this year, "he praised Barisic.
The team showed nature of the screen, too, provided the two-to-0 flank through Hofmann after a good hour that eventually brought the decision.
For before that, the guests could well have written.
"Thanks to God, we have been lucky today," noted the screeching of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results have not been voted, but the player has always been good relative to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games earlier than today," the strongest team played in this season was "in this stone."
Thus, the first three pronouncements since July 26 have shown that the fabric of team is intact, "Today, my team has shown that it is character."
"That we have finally played too zero" for him, not least happily, "
Much work during the country ’ s interplay, too, is the fact that, with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar, and Michael Schimpelsberger, several defaults, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philipp Schobesberger, has a more valuable victory.
"Don't forget this," Barisic, who lost in the last three days with honor and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
So the rally of countries must be used to "smooth wounds and put a little on the physical side," Barisic, who has five U21-suspension operators in his ranks.
One that is most likely to come from the pause is captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team and goes beyond pain.
At this severe stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "constatified Barisic.
Hofman did not only give way to Rapids before his 68th swing in the minute, but also reached the second gateway.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350 federal game, it was the first fix from the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2) over the Admira.
Hofman: "Don't believe that everything is good now" we certainly have been lucky, but, at some point, happiness must come back.
Now it was high time, "Hofmann said.
But he contemplated: "You can not always see this black and white.
We have not played as badly as this has been portrayed in recent weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role to the team.
It is a very young team that I can help for the moment.
"Hofmann said.
Green Coach Michael Baur had little charge of himself and his team.
He regretted the quick opposite "from the category of magic," as well as the regular goal of neutz in the 40th minute detected by referee colleagues.
The only charge that I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough for Tor in some phases.
We have had too little final conclusions.
Interior defense Maximicists to Karner looked similar: "It has started badly, but we have found it purely and even made a gateway.
By and large, more would have been there.
Red under this Vice
We showed a powerful tribe when the summer seriousness of "my piece of beautiful happiness" last Friday.
Several of these peasants still exist in the countryside; the abducted exemplar is the "scourge" of scourge above the bottom of the screen.
A bumpy footprint leads to the roughly 600 years old Eiche.
Koppings, bashing, and baseline seeds are over.
A piece below the collapse of the construction sberg, a kilometer north of the road to Christmas, is there.
Vital looks like the natural memory, running beyond the other trees of the environment, and reminds more than eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small budget dha in a building room indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intense inquiry, there were only hints of face arrival.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has, in addition, consulted the Bite Square of Archiv and asked elderly people from underground fires to know what it is related to the scourge.
The result of his revelations was a fairly sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the brick brains were supposed to have driven their animals from underground fires from the fatigue and freed by stones.
On the tree ’ s foot, the animal carriers exhausted by the rise are said to have wiped out.
Now the area has regained its relevance, because there are, in fact, rifts on the Vienna.
The area has also been declared to be the core of the biosphere reserve area, further discovered envy.
But there should be caution in the beating of the Stone Assembly, for the beating of the sun is also a popular residence site for the crossroads.
One way to go is from underground fires to tree, but somewhat hidden.
Further paths have been eradicated, the direction of high-ranking, and invited extensive migration.
Where is the Water Border?
But a water station that is being sought in our next task is rarely found.
Grassroots mirror already looks good at the construction plant, but we have some historical building in the countryside to which the building confederation could fit.
Where is our "piece of beautiful happiness"?
My Storm Rhine of Happiness
As with past years of Main Post, there are prices again this year when they have the right solution.
Those who like to photograph themselves can also join.
Under the e-mail address @ mainpost.de, you can give us the solution and your very personal "piece of the beauty of happiness" under this phrase.
The beautiful photos are published.
After weeks of pulling, Italy ’ s prime minister and current EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, voted against strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week ’ s special summit, Federica Mogherini, as the head of EU foreign policy, will be succeeded by the British analyst Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the government-to-government newspaper La Repubblica has returned, regards the appointment of his government ’ s Mogherini, also as a favorite favorite, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to quiet the leftist party base, which has become increasingly anti-him, because Mogherini is ordered - albeit more moderately.
Conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Council President would nominate Poland Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome is that a political reconciliation is made.
For the EU ’ s chief diplomacy is becoming Deputy President Juncker at the same time.
The EU Parliament ’ s approval is still considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano might not have called the nomination of the 410-year-old leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the party's top two decades of achievement and ambition Mogherini will face the "enormous challenges."
The bird fetus is married and has two daughters.
Their party carriers began the promoted political ologist in 1996 in the jurist organization of then-Democratici di Sinistra (leftist Democrats), which met with the Catholic centrist Margherita Party as today ’ s social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Jungsocialists) for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the Party Council of the Left Democrats, it rose into high party politics, working in the foreign policy department, whose leader soon got it.
It occupied traditional focus of Italian foreign policy like the Middle East, including studies of NATO ’ s operation in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved in a troop contingent, established contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the US Democrats.
Since 2008, it has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which it is an expert in defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his secretary of State.
If the PD now has a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement, which contributed to more than 40% of the party ’ s votes in May ’ s EU elections, Federica Mogherini has a stake in it, as PD notes.
The PD contains the provisions that new EU representatives have too little diplomatic experience, so lack of substance.
In Brussels, particularly Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherinis ’ s hyper-realistic actor is being pursued as a "pro-Russia" course.
It advocates South Stream, run by the Russian company Gas Prom, to transport Russian gas directly to southern Europe, which also serves Italy ’ s energy security.
After Renzi came to power as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit to the state.
Photographs they showed with Putin at the Shake-hands were indignant in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin ’ s leader to become a mainstream economic summit in October.
Overall, nine young people began their education at the Nabburg meeting on Monday.
This is an azubi that has already completed a different education in the company.
In four education invoices, the new employees are future: electronics (three educated), mechanics (two), machinery mechanics (two), and procedural mechanics (two).
All Azuorf comes from the countryside of swamp: Tobias Braun and Thomas Braun of Black Chess, Stefan Brickl, and Florian Rewitzer of Schmidgades, Johannes Beer of Neunburg Forest, Felix Domaier of Upper Vices, Daniel Sorgentian, and Sebastian Zahdd from Ferdind, and Teunz.
The new entrants visited primary and medium-size schools and real schools before.
From Wednesday to Friday, the educators of all millennia, as well as the training of a teaming event to the upper magazine, where, among other things, whole immigration and refining are on the agenda.
Germany counts 435 and 950 workers worldwide.
Education for every millennium is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep the mouth and get France right," said the most important ally of Franco Hollande.
Herr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "its love" to the controversial Socialist president, whose cabinet accumulation has been met with disapproval among the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves respect for everyone; he deserves our loyalty; he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said, with great applause.
As a troubling gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France ’ s controversial 35-hour week, despite strong calls for the relaxation of Emmanuel Macrons, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Herr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, sent Sand into the wheels when she met breakaway socialist legislators and criticized the Socialist Party for "assuming the French faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, derided the constant infighting by the Socialists, saying that she can not imagine that the new Valley ’ s government would last for more than a few months.
Franco ’ s Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none; they are forced to form a new government, if the old one summer has not survived.
"And the new one will not survive this autumn or winter," said headlines Le Pen to supporters.
She reiterated her party ’ s call for a breakup of the parliament, saying that she was confident to emerge as a winner in early elections and is ready for the government.
France ’ s ruling party was defeated in the March local elections, and the right-wing National Front was in the EU ’ s May elections.
A poll in the journal du Disome Sunday newspaper found that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande ’ s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government is not improving the economy and reporting numbers.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must feel fast that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise Shortly Before a 3 Mrinises Deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Line NCHL, the world ’ s third largest crossroads provider, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire Cruises International Inc, according to the industry.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Cruises ’ luxury creative credentials, and wealthy circulation, while major rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Carnival Corp (CCL) compete.
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources on Sunday said, warning that the talks might end without result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLLLC (APO), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources ask to remain anonymous, because the negotiations are not public.
Norwegian Cruise officials and prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
Norwegian Cruise, a miami company, operates 13 crossroads on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, Central America, and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, up from 13% in 2012.
Pressing Cruises, also located in Miami, operate under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which share eight crossroads on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa, and South America.
It reported $1.2 billion in revenue in 2013, a 6% increase compared to last year.
The crossroads industry as a whole is about $29 billion, and is expected to strengthen the middle class in emerging economies like China and India in the next few years.
Companies try to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers in the crusaders.
Pressing Cruises requested a stock market decline in US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo is the controlling shareholder in the company since $850 million in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise, in his current form in 2000, was created by a merger with a crossroads owned by Genting Bhd (GENT), a leisure and casinomy company controlled by the Malay billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock market in January 2013.
Genting held 28% of shares, Apollo 20% of shares, and the private equity company TPG Capital LP at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and Norwegian Cruise collectively have 82% of the passenger ’ s passenger capacity at American Crusaders, according to the original report on press Cruises ’ stock market.
Prosecuted Hong Kong ’ s activists condemn China the day after the vote.
A pekingship group neared the Chinese flag.
The permanent National People ’ s Congress Committee adopted a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates to lead in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is likely to be staffed by pekingual members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to retain their threat and smash Hong Kong's "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China ’ s leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, where China ’ s dominance was highlighted over Hong Kong in June, democrats held an unofficial referendum on electoral procedures in the special administration region, with hundreds of thousands marching in the city ’ s business district and organizing a seat there.
Li ’ s survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese connectivity agency in Hong Kong.
Deputy Chair of the Commission of Justice, Zhang Rongshun, and Deputy Director of the Office on Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned over the day.
Studish activists announced that they will gather on the afternoon before the Hong Kong leadership office.
Britain did not have democratic elements until the end of Hong Kong's 150-year colonial government.
Putin demands the establishment of "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government launch the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and engage directly in negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, under the control of the separatists, would be part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin ’ s call for the Kyiv government to negotiate with pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with his strategy since the riots began five months ago: assisting the separatists in taking territories and pressing the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to become a de de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with Kanal Eins state-owned television channel, Putin condemned Ukraine ’ s military campaign to regain the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately called the territory involved "Novorossiya" or "Neurossiya," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary blankage of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who campaigned for Ukrainian politicians on the polls on the 26 th, and while government groups of civilian communities attack areas held by separatists, "hope to be caught in their illusions," he reported.
"We need to engage promptly on exploratory talks, not only on technical issues, but also with the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy, discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, must be viewed in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the Eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarity to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to lead in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict opinion polls provided a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy promoted by Russian diplomats on international forums would give Ukraine ’ s regional governments full authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thereby giving the Kremlin de facto control over a territory that combines Russia ’ s territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the sanctuary for most of the Russian navy, as well as a major commercial port and historical coastal region.
Moreover, regions between the Russian and Crimea rostowland are rich in mines, factories, and goats that create important components of the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, in his June 7 speech on the inauguration of office, that Ukraine's legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the constitution to grant them greater control over their finances and language status.
But his idea of autonomy seems to contract sharply with that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, who are accused of arming and dismantling Moscow.
Putin ’ s last call for Kyiv to negotiate with the separatist leaders on a footing followed last week, after another intrusion by the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks into eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azeri Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoovsk, the first step in the coup, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to acquire the strategic coastal region until Crimea.
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have been underway to impose a monopoly on marijurism, a tribal bomb of 500,000 inhabitants who lie between Novoovsk and the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine ’ s territory.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete action, and the leadership demanded further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers jailed into the Donbas region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of Ukraine ’ s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers included by Russia ’ s Ilowajsk incursion were exchanged for 10 Russian parachutes captured a week ago in Ukrainian territory, Lysenko told on Sunday.
Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not heed his anger at hackers, who presumably stolen Nacksheet images of his prayer Gabi Grecko and one of those who is one of Hollywood ’ s A Promis.
The film town is in excitement, as a series of clear photographs of a torn Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal over Internet celebrations.
The hacker, responsible for this, may have more than 60 chain photos of Lawrence, Star of "the Tribute of Panem," and of superstars, including the Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne model, the singers of Rihanna, Ariana Grande, and Lea Michelle, and the actress Kirste Dunst.
Melbourne ’ s Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky, and Grecko of Melbourne reportedly became public photographs for an icloud-gap.
The list is 101 Promis.
Edelists who had loved Grecko last month said to Confidential: "It is irreversible."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, the time in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack is "infamous," and that the bears felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer, with her former friend Scott Speedman, including two of the highest without a pool.
Palin's film plants include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Star Strahovsky, and the actress Browning of Sucker Punch, have not been available for comments on the hacked images.
As one representative Lawrence said to TMZ, "It is an abject violation of privacy."
As actress Seth Rogen denounced the hacker in his tissue, "Giving hacked images of a cell phone is nothing but selling headache."
In purely legal terms, the diffusion of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger, and Water were yesterday on the 8th spill on the Great Feldberg, thereby supporting the "help" of cancer children. "
The Tour, for which one torture was one, provided easy training for the other.
But everyone agreed in one thing: it got a fun.
Thomas Studanski may have done well last night.
For, for the first time in his life, the chief of the upper house yesterday took to the field.
For the good end.
He can easily sit away from the small muscle clergy, given that participation on the 8th spill on the Great Feldberg in favor of the United Nations of "assisting for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable insight.
One bad thing.
"I know now that I can - prima!"
Small Pigs in the Applause curve?
Near, once I had stopped, wolf's was …
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits in the upper house of the CDU, many of the 718 participants yesterday were in the early tau, and came close to exhaustion but happily in Plateau.
Others, by contrast, were easier to overcome the sixty kilometers of long terror between high and field dberg.
Norman Dieshaner, for example, is.
The founding politician of Kreiday's Red Day -- Red Dress, Red Bike -- made the launch a bit more unstatement ("Every great deal of profit is!"), but then turned out to be half a Profi, going after 45 minutes without respiratory ends.
He, too, has torn the horror into a rump, as did Nina Kuhn, the press secretary in the town of Upper Upper, who had joined Frank Green.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg radar" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here is Charity," Kuhn says.
At the same time, they had hit Paul Wenzel from the top of the day.
The boy (12) had slipped to upper in the morning, in order to tighten again.
Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung in the phone at 9 a.m., "he" made the Feldberg twice, and then sat home.
"Free tone" was also fraught.
Colonel Cultkioskus Chairman Radtours of the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had pleased 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo-race.
A crazy event.
"Andreas Balzke said.
The programmed corner says that he is an "ambitious contender."
He must be that, because he was going along with the "Fixie-Rad," he is also adorned but without cold...
It was not only the 20 other waters that went up above the White Wall and the mercy of the summit, but also a yogger who was behind a grain of weight.
Professor Volker Lischke, who security with his team, equipped with Allrad Bully and Quad, said, "I know" of Frankfurt, who tracts for a special scourge only that he himself draws the butcher, "so the man is his own chorus.
The 718 participants -- and hence as many as never -- had been sent to the dawn in the morning of groups.
The other waters first at 9.30 a.m.
It was followed by the first rival drivers and sellers by 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountainbians left behind.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the United Nations of the Great Feldberg, gave rise commandos and wished to join.
Next year, he hopes that he will succeed in blocking the wayside of the field for the safety of participants.

Obama News Netanyahu
The Obama/Netanyahu relationship is hardly benign.
They wanted to talk about implementing the international agreement and about Tehran ’ s destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
But the encounter also involves conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The Obama/Netanyahu relationship has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel ’ s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama deal on Iran ’ s nuclear program has deteriorated further.
In March, Netanyahu had issued a controversial speech to the Republicans ’ invitation to the US Congress, which was partly viewed as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not with Obama; a meeting rejected it with hints of the upcoming election in Israel.
In a Case of Nothing, Professors have shot his girlfriend
In a noguard, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend, and that officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "south dog" is still empty and likely to be raised, and said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone.
Within the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note centered on a white bloc: "I am so sorry to think I wanted to reverse it, I loved Amy, and I was the only woman ever loving me," and, according to the authorities' words, he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had studied in two online courses for the delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles in school, according to the police, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, on the door to his office.
Delta State University Police chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting by 10: 18 a.m.
He said that Lamb did eventually make the disastrous pity.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: lamb took the life when the police invaded him.
One day after the university ’ s shootings forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to gain a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as did what students and staff told him, helped to present a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said that they were pleasing on his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, mentioning the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both educated in the Social Science and History Directorate, which includes 17 members, and many students attended both courses.
At the same time, there were some inclinations on problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised Lamb, said that he also seemed to be somewhat exciting and nervous, "as if something is wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for conviction for health reasons, saying that he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic path to hiring as an assistant professor.
Universities President William Lage Forge said that he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "there was, of course, something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
Following the Campus flight, the police later found Lamb ’ s trail when he returned to Mississippi of Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb killed himself with a 5,38 Caliber Pistole in the backyard of a house, say, a mile south of his parent house on the city countryside of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Corgin Johnson.
His car was still in decline.
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to that house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 people and educated geography and pedagogy.
He traveled in pedagogy this spring.
One of the longtime girlfriends of Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic, and final.
Carla Hairston said she was 15, and Lamm was 20 when she met with common friends.
She and her friends were in the High School, and he was the cool of older guerrilla, which tried to teach her the gitar game for several years.
He was the women ’ s black.
Every girl screaming when he was there, "Hirston, now 40, and the Jackson suburb of Brandon habitually said.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously united for some time.
In the notruf, Lamb said, “I killed my wife, ” but there was no surveys of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, living with them in the Backstein House, which borders on a Bax in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was right.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were five-year ago, but had friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was utterly destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O ’ Steen said that he never met Lamb, but his daughter Abigail told him that Lamb was interested in music and played Blue.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail appeared three years ago in a summer market.
Later, they played one or the other poison.
O'Steen said that his daughter writes and embraces her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak bear near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night last time, after Lamb ended his gitarren and Mundharmonikh gamble.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Simply a happy couple," he said.
We were on the cleanup and screaming each other.
I think they had a good sense of cheating.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first seminary and specialized in American inhabitants and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas, and was President of his Brotherhood and student committee.
At the delta State Campus in Cleveland, some 900 people attended a ceremony commemorator on the service day, including teachers, staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also participated in the monument, while the university professor "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson is reinstated on Wednesday.
"We try to get our students to return to," Ladies said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the noble after shocking the smidt, and that Lamm called his wife in his notruf, but there is no indication that they have ever been secreted.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season workers as last year, but the toy and baby manufacturers say that he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people across the country in shipments and distribution centers, and 45,000 more workers were hired in the run-up to 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with ratings talks, and that the number of workers will rise from October to December.
While holidays are a matter of months away, the shelter business is closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to provide shops with workers selling, sending, and supplying products.
Michael J. Fox writes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiums of "Back to the Future" were a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater for the royals, and I realize that the seat is empty next to me, and it is gradually clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trainee for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film starts, and I find myself in the sense that I am a stimulated paralysis and a long way from being with Wales ’ s pronouncer in an act.
"Back in Time," a document on "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemecker and Steven Plaberg.
"Back for the Future" was premiere 30 years ago.
"It is really for me," Plaberg said, "unquestionably the greatest time movie ever revised."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD, and in selected movies in October.
UN Leader says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is that "There is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for nearly five years, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and hardship for millions of people.
The UN leader again calls for all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday that he plans to meet foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council -- the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France -- on the brink of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the Syrian crisis that they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll numbers show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to frame him as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But, no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump in the double-digit area, and some start wondering seriously what it means for the opportunities to nominate the property moguls.
Of course, it is still too early in the election term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win Republican nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry ’ s leadership was given to the rise of Herman Cain at the time of 2011, none of which won even a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he has to fight in a general election.
But outsiders such as Jeb Bush ’ s Super PAC and the conservative Club for Growth now recognize Trump ’ s longevity and start flowing their dollars to topple him.
Here, some recent survey numbers indicate that the real-estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump ’ s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of ten say they have negative opinion.
And these are early states.
A quinnipipe vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said that they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they are "outraged" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they are "enthusiastic" v. 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The Next in Pain?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they are "unhappy" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not view Trump ’ s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52% of Irish voters, who tend to be Republican, believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperature for a president, ABC News/Washington Post said on Monday.
The same number is true in the nation ’ s first pre-election state, Iowa, where the same 52% of Republicans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander-in-chief, according to Quinpiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44% think he does not have the personality to succeed effectively, and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit the White House, ABC/Post says.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set their scholars, Republican voters consider Trump real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This has been a change since the end of July, when four out of ten were putting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to just 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a variety of GOP voters consider Trump ’ s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts suggest that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump ’ s leadership, while the anti-contraction scupport is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll at Monmouth University in early September shows that, in a hypothetical near-match race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is receiving majority support.
He has 19 points ahead of Carly Fiorina 13 points ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush, and finally ahead of Paul, John Kaiser, and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a near-match race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would surpass 19 in a hypothetical near-race for entrepreneurs.
A narrow majority of Donal-Trump fans say that they have formed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes.
Of course, much can be done to change this, and no one can really say that no one can ever change opinion.
46% said they left the door open to other candidates.
Yet Trump ’ s most forceful rival is now the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have come to mind are twice as common to Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they are consistent with fallacy on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the lynchpin of public discourse to 2016.
Some worry that Trump ’ s bombastic narrative will keep Hezbollah out of the Republican Party and damage the reorientation effort.
But, after the new Monday ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say that they are consistent with Trump on immigration issues.
So long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing the same.
The government ’ s frustration is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, particularly their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Montago survey of ABC/Post that they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A poll by Des Moine ’ s register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowi Republican Republicans are frustrated with Congressional Republicans, with 54% "dissatisfied" and 21% "oil-inflammatory."
Munich, Sylt, and Co.: Germany ’ s five most exclusive housing areas
Here is where the most expensive residential facility is in the Hosboat route, looking at the Northern Sea.
In the street, a square meter of a residential house costs $73,300 on average.
"Syria naturally restricts the supply of objects," says, the study -- hence the high price.
A new study shows where a square meter costs the most.
Of course, €18.70 per square meter for a Munich student book is not really little.
Unlike Germany ’ s top housing, one of the costs comes like recurrence.
The real-estate service provider Engel & P has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German housing sites, with square meters at a disappearing level.
There are more than ten thousand euros of nix per square meter.
But who can afford …
Moreover, Munich, for once, is not at the top.
Champions ’ League: Bavail ’ s Dream Start thanks to Bavail and Getuses
Second tormentors in Pireus: Bavarian Star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
Thomas Müller ’ s lucky firestorm paved the FC the way to one earned 3: 0 at the Olympics of Pirew, then.
A sovereign plot of the Champions-League season.
World Chair Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC a mourning start to the "mission of Milan" in the dog of Pirew.
Trainer Pep Guardiola ’ s team won her record play in the champions League at Greece ’ s record-breaking Olympics in the hot atmosphere, thanks to Mumber Dopper ’ s double-pack (52/90th + 2) and iceen truffers (89).
The 12th Start in Serie is supposed to be the first step toward Final on May 28, 2016, Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the hurricane pot to Munich in the third round.
Happy was given the help of the Olympics Torwart Roberto, a flank shot of the World Champions League on the Bayern-led League.
"We won't underestimate them," Philipp Lahm promised Bavaria's captain, before the Karaiskakisi stadion match, 31,688 holistic fans -- and the Munichners spoke.
They showed a concentrated and dedicated notion without smoothing.
Pirew had won his latest six home games in the royal class, including named clubs like Manchester United, Atlético Madrid, or Juventus Turin.
Borussia Dormund (1: 3) also stumbled.
But the Bavaria, unseated in seven European duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were brave, but often too incoherent in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by the shift to the left of Douglas Costa, who rarely went through against the former Brain Swiss Omar Elabdellaoui.
Left-wing luck was more lucky than his left-wing flanks struck in the upper searchy.
In the 67 th minute, the world champion gave way to 2: 0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewanda.
First, when the Olympics storm Ideye Brown swept from the Polish headscarf (26).
Then, by taking direct account, Torwart Roberto pared with the knees (35).
Although the Bavaria people raised their usual dominant game, Pireus could set up needelstics.
But tormentor Manuel New was forgotten.
For example, when he led a shot of ideye over the latt (56).
Before New, Guardiola left a four-month chain with David Alaba at the center, along with Jerome Boateng, to defend it well.
Mario Gettes, back to muscular problems in the cadre, initially sat out.
The WM-Held had given green light only after final training, Sported Chairman Matthias Sammer said in "Sky": "Those who want to do otherwise, that is evil."
In the first change, Guardiola decided against him, too, when he brought Kingsley Coman to the battered Lewandovsky (59).
Grants came late for Arturo vidal (76), and made everything clear 13 minutes later; by the misery, they bothered.
Before that, the string had come to power in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partisan Bayern-fans appeared to have provoked followers of Pirew in their viewer bloc with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and took on the bullets of the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern-Fan was transported from the stadion.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke do hurt not only the lungs, but also the teeth - which suggests a long-term postdage.
The good news: if left without it, risk falls rapidly.
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several members of the German Food Research Institute (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had the risk of losing their teeth prematurely, by 2.5-3.6 times higher.
Scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The DIfE emphasizes the main causes of tootherness failure.
For these parodontis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors point out.
The correlation between smoking and tootherness thus relies on more frequent tobacco fertilizations of smokers.
It is not clear how far smoking increases the risk for KK.
People who stopped smoking could, however, reduce their risk in a short period of time are writing researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research."
But it may take more than a decade for the threat to fall back to the level of non-smokers, the restaurant Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
To persuade people to become non-smokers, the DIfE ’ s executive, Hein Boeing, said, “smoking shortenes life. ”
Not to smooth is good for pneumonia and combat, and, after our findings, we also lead to good madness to high age.
In Germany, more than 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 is disorderly, the DIfE shared.
Early studies would have pointed out that smoking already raises the risk of early accident.
The new long-term study underscore the findings.
archaeologists Judge Customs for Resists from Spectantics
For the time being, on the right, Rhine Right has been made archaeological dogs.
Beyond the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists of the Römi-Germanish-Museum skeleton and Remnasts of Historical Baues, Museums. Marcus Trier said on service Day.
Historians have been searching for so-called soil monuments since the start of construction at the margin.

The third edifice of the Rhineland Boulevards made archaeologists fifth.
Texas documents had already known that fourteenth-century stays and a church were located in the eighteenth century, triers explained.
Aside from remnants of the Fortress and the church tournament, a graveyard had also been discovered with some 350 graves that were probably part of the church.
Making the Young Women of Good

She was treated in a hospital in need of care and brought by rescue workers to a hospital.
There is no evidence about the next reason for the young woman to cross the equals.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses, or inhabitants have heard acute perceptions.

The EU Commission is proposing a New Court in dispute over TIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free-trade agreement, the European Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current Court of Arbitration.
Thus, the controversial private settlement facilities for disputes between corporations and states should be replaced by a more transparent system that is far more traditional in its way.
"We want to establish a system that citizens trust," the responsible EU commissioner Cecilia Malm explained in the idea.
The Swedish propose bringing the proposal as a European negotiating position into free-trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is supposed to create the world ’ s largest free-trade area of 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration process concretely dictate that EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court.
They are said to come from the EU, the US, and the third.
For the first time, it is also a second entity.
It would allow it to oppose judgments.
So far, participants have agreed with each other on referees, a possibility of entitlement against their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in fairness and justice, commented.
In the long run, it wants to work, according to its own words, on an International Investment Court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be resolved.
The investment-state arbitration process (ISDS), demanded mainly by large corporations, is considered one of the main reasons for Europe ’ s strong opposition to TIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can impose compensation at the expense of taxpayers, suspend national laws, or enforce reductions in consumer and environmental standards.
In first statements, anti-TTIP organizations like Campact called the EU Commission ’ s proposals inadequate.
Most critically, it was not intended to apply to the already negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
But German Economic Secretary Matthias Machig (SPD) called the plans great progress.
The Commission took into account important issues for reform, which German Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring of year.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government, too, welcomed the plans of malaise.
The European Business-Europe business association warned of limiting the economy ’ s gridlock by too many new rules.
Small and medium-size enterprises, in particular, could be disadvantaged, said.
When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, the Wednesday remains unclear.
The negotiations have been underway since mid-2013.
But investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be established at the end of this year.
This date is considered unsustainable.
The Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Seven years ago, Sufjan Stevens is sitting on the chamber Prime Minister Club (now luxury) stage.
Along with him, there is a patchwork on which the intimidating torturer recorded the Malaysian US state of Michigan with film.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Stevens ’ s lecture.
He tells different places that he has consistently recorded on the map, which his minute and shadowy sun report.
Where they were born, and, it seems, at home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a miraculously creative error.
With the Greetings of Michigan, published in 2003 and third, the Greed State, wisely composed lovers who can harmoniously coalesce to American torture in the late 1960's but can at any moment be tolerated.
The rumor is that "Michigan" is the first part of a remote series: each of the 50 states should be consulted.
But, as of 2004 and Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared, and there are positive expectations.
Stevens is being cut.
Live is enough to him Gitarre and Banjo.
A year later, the musicians living in New York are returning to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You to: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a flat masterpiece in 2005 appears.
Excessive to ideas and statist fame.
The album is rising into the US Billboard Charts and lacking an annual list of influential music media.
After highly productive experiments, Stevens then devote themselves to "The Age of Adz" (2010) very large electronic pieces of sales.
This sixth proper study is still broad, but supported by programmed sequences or Beats, and plays with all of the effects.
Prolonged fear of smaller clubs has become a colorful spectacle of neo-charity changes and big fluctuating bus.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is a part of a five-member Germany.
More!
Theater mainly presents the "Carrie and Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests now sit in their wings, the much-traveled Stevens are returning to intimacy and torture.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through widespread enrichment.
From the audience, one hears that the lecture is "more opaque," which can be "thrown away from the scene."
Stevens is only modestly instructed, plays acute few older songs, and finally comes under dead applause.
Jeremy Corbyns ’ s Debüt at the Prime Minister ’ s Question Round
Since his election, Mr Corbyns ’ s Debuck in the prime minister ’ s question of tension
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to give his debate to the prime minister ’ s question, and, for the first time, engage with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask himself the first of his six issues to be raised shortly after a day, with the media likely to test his record and Labour legislators close to scrutiny.
He called for "fewer theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he can overtake some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns ’ s leadership, for it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet, and after his speech on the TUC ’ s annual meeting on Day.
Meanwhile, Labour ’ s decision to remain silent during the fall of the national anthem in a commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain during the Day of Services provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories.
Mr Corbyns ’ s decision not to sink the national anthem has attracted attention
A Speaker of Mr Corbyn said that he had "stood in a respectful silence," and he recognized the "heroism of Royal Air Force in the airline camp around England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two NewBosnia's program that he had come to Labour's leader to sink the national anthem, "regardless of his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyni ’ s top team, calling for differences in the economy, defense, and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader.
The BBC ’ s political correspondent, Robin Brant, says that political differences are "blurring" within Labour, even after Mr Corbyns statements on the position of the European Union and limits on profits.
Mr Corbyn, the TUC conference, said that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said that the party is "very clear" that it is only against government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to $23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be Labour ’ s fifth leader, David Cameron, since he has been Tory Chairman, over the last decade against the Dispatch Box in Parliament.
Labour ’ s leader, who has promised another policy, says that he has "crowd resources" ideas for questions about Cameron, and has given him more than 30,000 incentives.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister's question is too confrontational, and that he will be subject to both "sincerity" and strife with repudiation, instead focusing on serious problems like poverty, inequality, and challenges to young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic ministers, will represent him if he does not participate – for example, when Mr. Cameron is headed abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally do the word, and that he spoke John Bercow, the spokesman of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove himself from the politics of a "Kasperl theater" that is often linked to the prime minister's question, but acknowledged a few years later that he had failed.
For starters, because it was broadcast on television in 1990, the question was seen as the prime minister ’ s most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his legislatures, even though critics have argued that they have become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.

Poverty Grows by accelerating Wage Growth in the United Kingdom
The pound jumped by data showing an increase in the UK wage growth, while the SABMiller ’ s imperative was boosted 100.
Between May and July, without bonuses in the United Kingdom, the result grew by 2.9% against the same previous year period.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009, and it has made assessments of the timing of a rate hike.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.505, and had climbed to €1.3730, up from 0.84% against the euro.
The FTSE 100 index, with a 1.49% increase, reached 6.29.21.
SABMiller was the market ’ s excellent activist, and made a 20% leap after the rival AB Inv had taken over.
A transaction would combine the world ’ s two largest bribery sites and bring together brands like budgets, proxy Artois, Peroni, and Groundsk.
Burberry stocks were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Luxurn goods company Richemont.
Richemont ’ s latest sales are all of the expectations, and showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are returning to growth.
Glencore stocks rose by 5%, after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of his debt-reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi packaging and paper company were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% decline, after Goldman Sachs made its assessment of the company "selling."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company reported a pre-tax outcome of 46.6 million for the half-year.
JD Sports CEO says that higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports Peter Cowgill CEO says that a higher minimum wage for UKK workers could "mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset higher labor costs at his firm, he says.
He added the cost to the JD Sports ’ expansionary plans, which could mean fewer additional jobs.
Legal Biever in the capital: Biever Expedition in Berlin
Justin Biever, Megastar.
Lappper 21 years of boy, a hand-off with a superficial crisis.
The type of landfilled hair of €100 million is difficult.
More.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is passing.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-olds never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans were yesterday ’ s justice.
Poland ’ s Ewa and Victoria are under this.
But, since 7 a.m., polio has sided in power in the cold stone squares of Berlin ’ s Luxushotel.
Biever construction: Here is where their idol, whose poster hangs in Stettin, has lived since Montaggering.
The Suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs just as much the day as her Mama Ewa deserves in half a year.
If anything.
"In fact, my tenth class would have to sit in Gymnasium in my name."
"I fulfilled her dream."
Should School?
Who Judges?
Fans do not.
Nor do fever himself.
That has already been the case.
He received three million speeches for the superbowl ’ s advertising ceremonies, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company that gave many dollars to the Biever account.
And, in any buffer that looks like he and the label, Biever also gets the same thing.
When Justin Biever drinks a coffee, one is amazed at the window.
He is said to have exploited more than 100 million.
Some say that the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that Biever is finally in the US and the United Kingdom with its new sine "do you mean?"
Biever himself, whose fourth birthplace is to follow in November, is not interested for the first time.
At least it does.
Pegida-plakat Pemerintah di Tiongkok
Photographs or Beautiers?
It is both - and it in the potato beauty that Oldenburger Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the slogan "Kartoffel, not the beauty," on a placard of the Pegida movement, Alhay Kartoffel and meat put together a mirror.
It brought him to the idea a placard in a Pegida demonstration, writing "potatoes rather than beauty" that he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a flu level of flu has been turned in his Laden, with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stick," says Alhay.
The idea has come with the Lebanese patent office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a pattern of use, according to the authority.
How much meat is contained, and how much potatoes of the mirror, is not to betray Alhay.
Only so much: "It screens together even better," he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also good for its customers.
Metcash is launching a Soil Confession campaign to Fight Aldi ’ s Incident
Metcash seeks to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi rise in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food grandtrader Metcash has launched a land-crime campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 holes in South Australia and Western Australia earlier next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen ties with local food suppliers and build the IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing of social media, as well as Events and Adelaide Show.
IGA traders and suppliers are crumbling on board, with brands like iron manufacturer Simmo of Dunborough, who is distributing samples in IGA shops and selling shopkeepers to trusted customers for South Australia ’ s soccer league.
Metcash is expected to publish more details of his defense strategy on September 29, when the grandtrader for food, alcohol, and equipment conducts his annual investor strategy.
Much is at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30% of metcashs IGA load operations and generate higher profit margins than metcashs IGA networks in the East states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA retailers have far more market share than in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensa – more than 30% in South Australia, and 24% in Western Australia, compared to about 14% in the East states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, 12 months after opening its first markets, Aldi will shut off some 5% of the food market in these two states and take off all existing actors, but mostly self-sufficient, retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley ’ s analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and meta-million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and produce a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
Losing food and food, and metabolishing high fixed-price metabolism, could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, metropolitan shares in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs ’ s sales in food and food will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business ethos in Melbourne that metastasized would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash would disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass ’ s comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of metal has been involved with Mr Douglass last week.
IGA ’ s market share has fallen by 43% since 2010, from 18% to 14%, and earnings from metcashs that provide about 1,200 IGA retailers have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging while putting pressure on sales and margins.
But the grandtrader finds himself and invests more than $150 million to match prices with coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their lions through faster-growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private-sector foods.
Metcashs ’ s chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that price adjustments and last-selling programs will be on track, hoping that, for the first time in four years in 2017, the maker will return to earnings growth.
Thanah Kokkinakis, the President of Australia ’ s Steve Healy Tennis Association
Thanah Kokyakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanah Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgio, and, according to the President Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinaki, the younger of the talented duo, always called "Special Ks," was exposed by the infamous dispute between Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a firebrand match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinaki and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, had to be separated twice by the referee, calling on Harrison: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
At last, while he was seen to crush a tennis player after a stronghold storm celebrated a potential US opensity victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinaki was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgov, in competition with Sam Groth, for second place in the one-off rally, behind Bernard Tomic in Dav-Cup.
"One thing I am pretty envy about is the fact that, in my view, Thanhazi was dragged into the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a blow when he lost because of a stronghold in the US opera, but he is not the first player to break a blow of frustration with himself, and I know Thanah well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, in fact, he has behaved extremely well in the US opera, even under rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves much credit.
He has a brave team around himself, he has a great family around himself, and I believe he has been treated a bit too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits with the team, and so on, he never had a problem with the other players; he is respected in the environment; he trained hard; he is good; he is a very stable and mature young guy; and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgio in the important decision that begins on the Friday, and described the "common decision" as the right thing for everyone, but he secures the man of Canberra as a long-term fixed part of the team. "
"First, we want the team to be totally focused on competition, not all of the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federers and Murray pointed out. He has made some bad mistakes in the public ’ s eyes, and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, trying to understand the consequences of his actions, some time outside the spotlight in which he can think about it, and is best for him.
Europe ’ s Refugee Crisis: Hungary ’ s Emergency, Limits, Keeps Refugees
Hungary explains the state of emergency and cancelled the southern border with Serbia on the day, keeping everyone trying to enter the country illegally, with the goal of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border, when hundreds of migrants gathered and Serbian officials reacted with outrage in a Niemeni country.
The people fleeing violence were stuck and settled in a street dispute between the two checkpoints of control in the country for an unknown period.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter sat over them, migrants chanted "opening the border!" and shielded insults against Hungary's enrollment police.
Some rejected food and water protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
Talk with Brussels and other countries must be made in the coming days, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc, at a disputed meeting in Brussels, without a common immigration policy.
But the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overblown Italy and Greece, hoping that a deal would finally be reached by the end of the year, or by the end of the year, that the EU states would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit on the European Union on the service day to discuss the continent ’ s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not apply its hopes to a Soon move by Brussels or its neighbors.
The emergency set up on the service day in two southern regions gave officials more authority to manage the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto said that his country is also planning to build a steam dratzaw along its border with Romania in order to halt the influx of migrants from the country after ending a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News-Correspondent Charlie D ’ Agata reported that even prison inmates were used to create the Stacheldrat fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major squeeze and a starting point for many of the migrants of war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
But Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the coming economic migrants in search of a better life, not war migrants, who are eligible for protection – a view that contrasts strongly with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 14-meter (13 foot) high fly that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime, including higher sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, Hungary's government explains the state of emergency," government Speaker Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still agree on the use of the military, which is expected to be next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border.
Gyorgy Bakondi, a country-security adviser to Orban, said that 45 people were already more involved in the country in trying to cross the border.
They come through by damaging the fence, now in police custody, and are accused of offending offenses under the new laws.
Officials are rapidly repairing the fence.
Hungary ’ s civil servants signed earlier on the service day, including two of the seven frontiers with Serbia, after a move carrying stacheldragon to close the border.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszz, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metall-container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push it out.
Some 20 have been able to do so, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection of Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton ’ s pre-Bernie Sanders lead in National Survey
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to enjoy a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47% of democratic voters in the primary elections (58% earlier), while Sanders ranks second, with 27% (17% rise).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, is gaining support from 15% of democratic voters in the primary elections.
More than five months before the primary elections began, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support.
But Clinton ’ s supporters are more constant than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News-poll, Clinton has lost in a series of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a major advantage for women and moderates, but those advantages have declined.
Their male support has plummeted, and Sanders has only 5 points behind.
Clinton ’ s advantage of democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated, and they and Sanders are now equal.
Clinton, however, has a major advantage among the elderly.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double-edged advantage in the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Roughly half of the democratic electorate in the national primary elections say that, with enthusiasm, they would support Clinton if the party nominated them.
A quarter would support them with some reservations, and 15% more would support them only because they are the candidate.
Six% would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton ’ s current supporters are enthusiastic, above all.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48% of democratic voters say in the primary elections that they are enthusiastic about Clinton, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidates, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton ’ s supporters are asked about why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that they have the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13%), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton ’ s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
Acceptance to address the problems and the availability of the eligibility is also cited.
Because the vice president has a potential for the presidency, 57% of democratic voters want to see him in the race, even though one-third believe he should not.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton ’ s supporters, more than half say that Biden would be her second election far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton ’ s advantage increases before Sanders, from 20 points of beds to 30 without him in the race.
Fifty-five% of democratic voters view Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election, but 78% last month.
Biden is by no means a second in this measurement, but the percentage that he sees as the "most votes" has increased.
Yet, when it comes to what matters to a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
Like last month, a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate emerges as unacceptable to these voters in the primary elections.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in their party ’ s primary elections.
majorities view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and with strong leadership.
Biden ranks best in the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton ’ s strength is leadership.
Thirty% of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy; twice as many say about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not think he does.
Democratic voters in the primary elections generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as being ideologically consistent with their views.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of the democratic electorate has no opinion from Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a personal e-mail address and a service during the tenure of Secretary of State continue to be asked, most Democratic voters are satisfied with their declaration of the matter, saying that it has not influenced their opinion as a whole.
But it is another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about one-third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton ’ s conventional wisdom, even though 36% said that her opinion had deteriorated.
It is mainly Republican, more than six of 10, who say that Clinton ’ s views have become worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her party ’ s voters, this remains a problem for her overall voters: only 32% view her as honest and credible, eight% less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
They do not consider 62% of the electorate to be an honest and credible person.
At the same time, 55% of voters view Trump as being not honest and untrustworthy nationwide.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good governance notes.
Biden, Carson, and Bush rank best in honesty from the six candidates tested.
A majority view Sanders as honest, but, like Carson, many disagree with him.
The misalignment rate for the 351 Democratic electorate in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Goes to Donald Trump ’ s National Survey
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of the new poll ’ s support, and others are dramatically losing their heat.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, with support growing by 27% in last month ’ s CBS survey, conducted before Fox News ’ s debate.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well among demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kazuna, has been defeated with Wiscons Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Arkansas Mike Huckabee ’ s former governor and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio, is third.
The misleading margins in the 376 Republican electorate sample in this latest poll are Plus or Minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is growing in the polls - 19% support among Republicans, behind the Trump with 32%.
The recent ABC News/Washington Post poll showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some silk case for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump ’ s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Annual blood temperatures: the eastern Mediterranean is now up to 29 degrees warm.
While high levels are measured only remotely, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough to find warm water.
A bad in the north or East Sea should be a rather short pleasure for 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: 18 degrees of water in the North and East Sea this week shares Germany ’ s weather service (DWD).
Badetemperatures, by contrast, continue to provide the Mediterranean: in the east, there are up to 29 degrees.
It is 25 degrees at the top in the Adria, 23 degrees in France.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five Members of the Brotherhood have a Death of Baruch College Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a jihadist ritual of a Pocono Mountain student connection, Pennsylvania, died, murder charges are met against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi-Delta Psic Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a September 2013 inauguration rituals, delaying his transport to the hospital, which helped his death, told the police.
Officials said that he had been burdened with a close eye with a 30-year-old spate of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng, after all, complained about headaches, and then conspicuously fell.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psic Brotherhood did not appeal to the number of nowhere in 911, after Deng became impotent and supposedly waiting an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
But they had the time to change Deng ’ s clothes, govern his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood ’ s national president, to bring advice to the Council, said Police Speaker Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At that point, members began hiding Utensiles and basic benevolence of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," policeman Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died next morning from his injuries.
After a car report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with stumbling force inflicted injuries to heads, rapes, and grandchildren.
"Too many families were destroyed by the Muslim Brotherhood's bullying; at least one student died from the bullying every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Breakthroughs and their members must be held accountable, and this move is important by authorities.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-three members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are charged with sheer attacks and training of criminal association.
"We want to blame the people involved, not just when there is an organization that - either officially or unofficially - sanctioned, we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on the day.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has contradicted its affiliation with the local group.
That will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike comes, and the house will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slip into recession.
We know that.
What we don ’ t know is how long this will last, and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike, and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve ’ s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
As a result, US central bankers have stressed so strongly that investors should focus not on when to start raising interest rates, but on the period needed for normalization.
Indeed, several variables matter.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the entire excitement about raising interest rates may have been exaggerated.
"The first Fed increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the era of" cheap money, "Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, told clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still too low to lead to the mutual shock that many seem to fear.
But that does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a view based on historical trends on how some parts of the economy could respond:
As the market saw last month, avoiding interest-rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to choke off wealth yields 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," German bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after Fed rate hikes.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward motion – about 14% – on the path to raising interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days after (average 2.6%), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4% on average over the past six, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, the CEO Nuveron Barveron, in management.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effect on stocks tends to be later in the equity cycle, and that the yield begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote rate hikes.
In this case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before, and that could accelerate a recession.
What is striking is that GDP will be near its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to the Deutsche Bank, nominal GDP has been below 4.5%, at the 118 interest-rate hikes since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect this to last, and to be only 1.5% in the third quarter of the Atlantic.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic cliff could be risky and raise the question of "Whether it is different this time," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants took this year for a Fed rate hike, and all eyes were aimed at this week ’ s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends this week.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, futures trading is only 25% more likely.
"In our study, all of our overblown cycles occurred in a super-cycle of GDP from 1950 to now, with rising GDP momentum and pre-recession hits in the shadows of the recovery very quickly."
By contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, and that is 74 months away.
Certain income has also been volatile, as the market prefers to raise interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields seem to be shifting direction once the first increase/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the credit cycle, bond yields fall immediately, the German bank said.
Charles Schwab ’ s strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to pick up, causing the curve to decline.
High-yielding bonds often yield better in such a climate, even though "we are still wary of expecting higher returns," Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income-Analysis in Swab, said in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones argues, that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"There are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy, in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations."
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit has expanded, and volatility has increased – all of the features of the market when the Fed tightened its strategy.
For the most part and all of the world, companies that negotiate the bulk of their operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to be very good at responding three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have outperformed firms with a weak record after any rate hike in 1994, 1999, and 2004 by 5 percentage points on average.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Businesses with high levels of flexible interest will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock game, consumers will also benefit from the rise of the dollar.
Savers may see profits through higher returns, even if experts disagree about how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a Classic FM copy, says Parliament member Andrew Bingham
Parliament Conservative member criticized the station for "dumping"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that it imitated The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "shifts to Classic FM," claims a leading MP member, and increases new pressure on the station to prove that it does what private senators do not do.
Andrew Bingham, the conservative legislator, also told the BBBC that the public-sector radio station is "stupid" and increasingly indistinguisham from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 does not like to use the word" dim "-- but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be just another name.
So, if you try to do otherwise - two spontaneously called examples in which you merely imitate what is already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General Director-General rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far from commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I mean from Radio 3 will not learn about classic music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music music that is truly unmatched.
"And I think radio 3 is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that tougher work must be worked to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classic music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing of the Committee on the selection of Culture, Media, and sports, was under fire to join the commercial rival.
Damien Collins, a Tory MP, attacked The Voice – the BBC ’ s music talent show, bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you think that this program is often discussed because it is not originally and not very marvelous?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC was produced 1-Show, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge, "special BBC" was produced.
He added that he wishes that the company "finds a doit out of our own store," when next time it launched an entertainment.
But he refused to exclude the provision of further ranks from The Voice in the future, or to spend the fee payers on other entertainment forums.
Internet sales rose most slowly in August, and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven% increase in online sales.
Last month, there has been the lowest result since the records began in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by using cell phones to buy
Experts believe that November ’ s Black Friday cut spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been offering, and many of the UK ’ s main shopping roads have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnant, as new figures showed only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending in August has represented the lowest growth rate since the start of the records in 2000, with only five% increase last year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnant, as new figures showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth rates for the preceding years and decline by 2000, it has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMF RG sale dexe, said the Guardian.
He declared that online sales strengthened three years ago, when buyers began to engage in their purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online, and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home at the Sofa.
But that is now happening, and we may see growth slow.
The Black-Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as one reason for waning sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before the event that occurred on November ’ s Friday.
Last year, the average number of buyers around their computers was sharp to make their bottlenecks, and some traders ’ websites plummeted.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers fought for snail, may discourage buyers from buying.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that $5 billion spent was spent slightly more than £1 online.
In some products, such as television screens and washing machines, more than one-third of purchases are now carried out through Web phones.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoe online, rather than in domestic cities.
Muslims are burying Mecca's sick accident -- Bin Laden's Family is sanctioned
The Pigs of 29 Death are borne by Muslims in Mecca
Saudi Arabia ’ s Burdening Breakdown in part of the huge Saud Bin Laden
The Health Ministry said that 394 people were also injured after the Storm toppled
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crowd of Mecca ’ s grandmosque collapsed.
Smourning filled, largely in familiar shape, the horrors to pay for their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al Moaissem-Friedhof.
The trauma process passed on to the Holy Staff, where only days earlier a building crash plummeted by the mosque ’ s ceiling and then on the beaches.
The bodies were liberated for the funeral, when the Saudi king imposed a Santion on the Bin Laden family ’ s construction company because of the disaster that left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 officers killed when the Great Central Mosque of Mecca plummeted were carried out by the streets.
Among the dead, Qasim Akram was composed of Bolton, the Greater Manchester, father of four children on his first pilgrims when the stronghold crashed.
Mr Akram, with his parents, was in the Great Mosque before the annual hemisphere began.
Saudi officials have already agreed that the hemisphere to Mecca will continue with thousands of people who will continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have kept the poor alive when he was not used.
An Arab version of the decree released by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency ’ s English-speaking service did not report this detail, but said that the company ’ s leadership is prohibited from foreign travel.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal, causing the demise of the sick who plummeted into an inner mosque inner house, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the skin that month.
The Bin Laden group has issued no statements about the collapse of the sick, and its representatives have not been available for a statement.
The royal decree also tapped the group for non-current security measures, and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of beaches surrounds Mecca ’ s grandmosque as part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin Laden group.
Bin Laden ’ s family has been associated with Saudi Arabia ’ s ruling family for decades and is taking on major construction projects.
Al Qaeda ’ s late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a breakaway son, expropriated by the family in the 1990 ’ s.
The collapse of the sick came in the midst of strong winds and rains, just days before millions arrived in the Kingdom for pilgrimages, which are needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) should be paid to the followers, and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injuries receive half that amount.
B & Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is Over
Increasingly employ artisans, Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe is Rising
As a result, 200 other screening avenues aimed at craftsmen are opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q sellers nationwide
The City of Daily Mail
It is argued that Britons leave their dogs and pinsel in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who perform the work at home.
If you can skillfully deal with a hammer or a pink to clean up wheat, you seem to be a minority today.
For Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to conduct home jobs in their homes, according to the company ’ s headquarters behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, a new Kingfish executive who owns the building chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who are now offering services at below-price prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screening fish screen screen Shops, to traders and to close 60 sellers of B & Q.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & QD ’ s, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in Laden are made by women.
For now, the staff outweighs men.
She said that it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single-household trends than in the past.
As Mrs Laury put it, "A majority of men still work in our branches.
We need to shift this toward equilibrium.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80% of the decisions to purchase articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, a leading company listed by only five women at the top of a British FSE100 index, has also reshaped her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50% of the team with women, including his management and financial board.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in semi-year profits and sales after the group incurred the cost of closing the slack.
Against the trend, Kingfish, who owns screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Amir/Dob for Trial Infidelity
In the country ’ s case of deposit fear, two officials at Wednesday of the Austrian People ’ s Republic, AI/Dob, must be held accountable for infidelity and derivatives.
The defendants were not guilty.
One was also charged with abuse.
He was legally acquitted from this charge in May.
The current process has been dispelled.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the investigation had crystallized that, in 2006 to 2011, the defendants used funds from United Nations accounts to which they were allowed to dispute in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is about €400,000.
Sporters are also charged with financial offenses.
This fact excluded the chairman of the opening room, Director Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated later.
In the draft of infidelity, defense was that no loss of wealth had ever emerged.
Sporters would have charged only harvest compensation, leading to the sports club for which they would have worked from 1982 to 2011, in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt – the Passiva was about €600,000 ($44,000) in 2001.
"Back then, we faced the situation: Do we continue to close the club or close us?" one of the defendants told one of the guilty, in the bread profession of the financial system. "
With his colleagues and associates, he then decided to do the job.
With all risks.
"We have required money to place our life insurance as collateral at the bank," he said in the event.
The agreement had been agreed: they can manage the money freely; only no debt can be made.
Further, if successful, the payment of relatives had been reversed until 1991.
So part of the kinship was paid only years later, starting in 2003, when a plus was on the account.
As a result, Pauschal – not detailed – seemed to be taking place, the former obman explained the same thing.
The accounts and austerity books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payment had not been detailed.
The agreement was not interested in the details of financial engineering; it was important that only debt freedom had been, the answer went.
When the investigation of abuses began in 2011, a €120,000 official was sent to the United Nations Convention.
That was what the defendants said.
The securities account went on the name of the second defendant, and, according to his statement, was not known to the agreement.
"Why?" the judges wanted to know.
The question was far from clear.
He then said, after all, that he believed that this is the best way to do it.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put him in the room.
The accused had been informed, the official justified.
This review was described as a "compensation for harm."
Why Schadenfreude?
This told the first defendant that he did not agree with the phrase because no harm was ever done to the agreement.
But I can do what to do when the lawyer says, "You are all out of the hook."
"Do I am a legislator?" he asked.
Further, the official said that he never paid a penny, he calculated only kilometers and diets.
On dits, he calculated a €1,000 per month, but the actual cost was much higher, adding it added.
Clearly, the defendants were unable to prove any accusations for the early years.
They had not been stopped being stopped following an exercise in which everything was judged correctly, they declared.
Kilometer money had also taken the second defendant.
All of the stubbornesses were made in cash, and he had to go from his location to the Bank to Bleiburg, declared in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on September 23 with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard Does Another 30,000 Jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been underway for three years, computer giant will reduce more jobs in the company ’ s secession.
The string enrichment of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) is not over.
US technology companies are planning to reduce their 25,000-30,000 corporate saving as part of their restructuring.
This would save $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion), and the company divided the service day.
The move would lead to a special burden of about $2.7 billion, which will come from the fourth quarter.
The 55,000 jobs now underway for three years are not completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 business year, HP hired some 302,000 employees.
In the aftermath, the Hewlett-Packard activism dropped 2.3%.
California ’ s Palo Alto, the power-grabbing company from California ’ s Palo Alto, is now dividing, as computers and printing are supposed to be integrated into a new society this year, separated from more sophisticated areas of computer evasion and data storage for firms and other services.
Both sectors are supposed to be listed on the stock market.
A newly disappointing PC sales, together with weaker demand for corporate customers for its services, recently added to Lenovo ’ s second-largest computer manufacturer.
In the third business quarterly at the end of July, sales of PC and printing declined by 11.5%.
The sales fell by 8%, to just $25.4 billion.
This reduced revenue in 15 quarters of 16 quarters.
HP responds to secession and massive deployments to industrial change.
The 76-year-old company, led by meg Whitman, has only recently responded that customers are more buying smartphones and tablets than conventional computers, and buying more and more business online.
Whitman ’ s restructuring plan as a whole envisages the reduction of some 55,000 jobs.

Automobile: Customach on the 66th IAA
The focus of the mass is on interconnected, self-driving cars and electric mobility by September 27.
After two prescriptions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile exhibition under the motto of "mobility" on the Donbas Day.
The broad audience can go to the IAA of Samday.
The CEOs of the automobile association expect about 900 visitors two years ago.
Violent Violence on the Serbian-Hungarian Frontier
Hungarian police have used rainfall and water flight against several hundred displaced refugees on the Serbian border.
Euronews-Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the breakout of violence at the border control point.
He reported telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
This had formed a police line, and a water worker was ready behind the police.
40-50 refugees began throwing steel and plastic flashes into civil servants.
Officials initially used uninterrupted caregiving language.
Then the police used tear gas.
Much tears were inflated toward refugees.
This has dissolved the group.
Refugees have now been waiting for some retreat.
A pregnant and seemingly injured woman was taken away from the zone.
Children who met the tears of England written.
Other refugees slaughtered and suffered from respiratory.
Serbian police press secretary also suffered injuries by using tears and nursing language.
The Fed ’ s Time to Choice
The world is watching when the Fed coincides on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision on whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll of 80 economists questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half who believed that the Fed would do so last week now thinks that the Fed will remain in a little longer and keep interest rates at zero - 0.25% today.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed raised interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time, we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and launch a process of normalization of interest rates, ” Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The US economy is at a relatively good level; trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet; and only low inflation is generated.
However, the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook for global affairs.
It warned markets to bid for an increase, but the signs suggest that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision to be announced by 20,00 Up MEZ on Thursday
Death Protection at Delta State University
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on the morning day of Monday -- and before he shot and killed his colleagues the day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "lazy" in the first murder and wanted to "do so," officials announced it on the day.
The police at Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, the Docent for Geography, and Social Scientific Education at Delta State University, called for No-Ten: 00 on Monday on Monday
He said that he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the center that the police must send police to his homes.
He said that "I shot my wife yesterday," and he also mentioned that a "Southern dog" is in the house, but that "no one will be disrupted," but that is likely to be excited.
The police asked the acclaim for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb offered no explanation for his shoots.
When police hit the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a headline-grabbing note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I do it so hard I wanted to reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman to love me ever. "
After the writing of notice, Lamb received 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before taking his own life on the evening, when policemen surrounded him.
Universities President William Lage Forge said that he knows nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "there was, of course, something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, officials said on the service day that "there is no information, no evidence" for a "Three Emergency."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married about seven years, as a "good man."
The two were demolished 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O's Steen said that he and Prentiss had a daughter 19, "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was "the best friends."
Prentiss worked online at home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
"You wanted to help other people," Knowles said
The police said that Lamb called relatives on Monday at a certain date to tell them that "he is not in jail."
When policemen recovered him near Greenville later this night, on high way 1, Lamb piled his car, fled, went to the forest, killing himself.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life league on the university ’ s Web site indicated.
Stars who Lost Gambling
The actress (left), in the image of his son Redmond (right), had several stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, on cancer.
The actress is also supposedly fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug owners.
All of this surely takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthanza Makes the Business
The Lufthansa is planning a major corporate reconstruction.
A half-billion euros annually want to save the Lufthane company with a better organization on its own.
150 of the world ’ s roughly 1,000 leaders will cost business reconstruction the job.
There are, however, new negotiations with the pilot union.
The Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and appreciating the cheap euro wings.
The goal of rebalancing is an outcome of about €500 million per year from cost and solving synergies, and the airline was divided on Wednesday.
Among other things, there is no future board for passengers in the Lufthansa.
Eurowings ’ cheap flight should be developed as separate as possible.
At the board of the chairman of Carste Spoch, Karl Ulrich Garnauer will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the replay, he underscores the importance of Eurowings, with which the company will continue to oppose Ryanair and Easyjet.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 staff has been complex.
The Airline Airline Group, under the umbrella of the Passage Airline, accounted for three-quarters of the €30 billion annual sales.
New Negotiations with the Pilots
In the tea conflict with the Cockpit pilot Association (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed after the legal slaughter on this Thursday.
This divided the union.
The issue of the talks is to be retirement rules for pilots.
Cockpit wants "to achieve sustainable results in a year of predicted record results.
The conflict between the Union and the Airline has led to controversial strikes in recent months.
Beyond pilots' transitional provision, the concept of "Wings" is the backdrop.
It is worth noting that in the fight against competitors, the Lufthansa is expelled from Eurowings to the firm ’ s own cheap line.
Under the name of "Morning to the south," paintings of Leena Kuchess in the artist House are to be seen.
The longstanding Finin Gate has put together an selection of intact work for the White Saal of the House, which encourages their viewers to admit grateful journey.
Manchester United Luke Shaw can not play for months because of double-fracturing
Luke Shaw suffered a double frame of his right in the Champions ’ s loss of Manchester at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this has brought the leftist foreign defenders to their feet for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not offer hope that Shaw can play again in that season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno on the 15th minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double interrogation culture and is in the hospital."
He will be displaced tomorrow or perhaps a day later, and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United States with 18, is very difficult, and then playing fantastic.
He had an oxygen mass in the clothes cabin.
He invaded.
I am no physician, but if you have a dual fracturing, then you will take six months, and he will not play in the group.
I hope that he can replay this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the imposition of a misery meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had strangled.
They can judge themselves by saying that a parrot and a red card were due.
It was a very severe attack with both legs.
As one tank on Shaw's account put it, "I thank everyone for your news: words can not describe how broken I am, my way to gene escalation now begins, I get back more."
In this respect, Manchester United States suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the PSV ’ s Loss
The Polish defense defender has an additional incentive to recover by the French European Parliament next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It is a very bad injury."
If a player leaves the scene with this kind of injury, everyone is saddening it.
It is never our players ’ intention to violate an opponent.
Moreno suffered a blow when Mexico played against Van Gaal ’ s Holland team at the World Cup in 2014.
"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to violate the enemy, and when you hear that it is a very bad injury," Cocu said.
I could not see the moment.
The only thing I saw was the ball going in a different direction so that it looked like [Moreno] had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, “I know what it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad at doing so, and I do it so badly.
The PSV actor Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital after a photo of Chris Smalling.
To be sure, does David know better about Cameron The Lorax?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: if your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it.
They may be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of children ’ s loyalty systems to name his favorite child book, Dr. Sear ’ s prime minister chose The Lorax, the Dr. Sea ’ s environmental fantasy in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a news on the superCamps ’ website, and continues: "Ultimately, moving, moving, creative, and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to preach my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the book ’ s action, refers instead to the 2012 movie version, which added new characters and details to expand the fairly brief text.
"In the midst of the written town of Thneed-ed-ed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a true tree," you read.
As if this is not suspicious enough, the text put forward by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lorax movie film, presented on the Internet Movie Database Web site, beginning with: "In the written town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hoping to win the heart of his girls."
Although he admits that he is a pragmatic father, Cameron seems unlikely to be so unfamiliar to the book ’ s actions, where an unenlightened boy hearing of the local environment hears about the money-hungry, trees, then-striking online, despite protests of name-named lorax, a high-speed, "that is wounded in the name of the trees."
Such a relatively low public-relations task was most likely delegated to a hero who did not read The Lorax 20 times after another child.
A Downing-Street-language spokesman said that the text probably came from Cameron ’ s electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that Cameron ’ s staff provided the text, but gave no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by excluding from England ’ s team, but it is still difficult
Addressing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but viewing the cadres that England chose for the Tour is not a repeat of the 3-0 testing defeat of my card.
I would not rule out an exit victory.
Alastair Cook ’ s side may have less experience than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Battling show, and the common spirit is strong; they will not wear fools of 2012, only a youthful and positive attitude.
Moeen Ali, with the ball, is emerging as a spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown testimony at the testing level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth leaves out of the English testing cadre and is replaced by Alex Hales.
Of course, the decision to allow Adam Lyth to leave is difficult to analyze for me as his chief coaches in Yorkshire.
There were two good attacks on his seven tests in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are directed at results.
There was no question sign at Joe Root, for example, and this led to nomination, because - and I have said it - players are their own best constituency.
Lyth had long been extended, but he had control of his own fate.
If he is hopefully shooting more purchases for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The British trainer Treim Bayliss praised his position, even if he did not do so well, and that is not surprising; he is, above all, a Team-man.
The question of how much time a test champion will be received in order to signal it is difficult.
Lyth received seven opportunities - Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and exit.
The only charge to be made was that, first, England began Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was high - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a catchphrase I estimate.
He is a X-factor cricket actor, which we saw in Yorkshire early in that season when he gained space against us in 236 on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very well.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this, of course, depends on the job creation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat next cook, which would provide an exhibi-spin bowler and receive four squeezes, appeared, and I have nothing to do about it.
I do not see why a catchphrase can not beat there, and this left-wing trader has already shown that he is a vicious cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number three for them, and there is no difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests in the first drug before he arrived as an open-in-person in 2001.
He managed three hundred Ru immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes as a backup spinner in the cadres, and in my limited dealings with him, he has deeply impressed me as a young man.
People may think of his statistics - on average, 31 with the bone and 35 - and think that it is a punt, but there are no large numbers of backup donors who raise their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on that path.
Aside from the team, England has made some smart amendments to training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawaste, Sri Lanka ’ s Batsman, as an adviser to the test games could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the best guys of the game, which will bring many experiences, because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingvood comes to the Tour ’ s White Kugelo phase and brings energy and a powerful string.
I always felt that he was created for international cricket competition, a player or a coach, and, like Mahela, he has insights on which to benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the clothes, even if the news is consistent with the previous secret.
Collys ’ s Teamcollege at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at One-Dayers, Root received a similar break with Australia, and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and teamers do not determine the timetable.
And they must bear in mind that, as with players, their jobs depend on outcomes.
Such choices are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit ’ s exit from the EU) could gain traction if the economy gets into a slump by 2017
David Cameron ’ s ill-conceived renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be in deeper trouble with every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy, “Is it yes or No? ” Corbyn will become the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is severely divided because of Europe on the service day.
Foreigners also have their corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, so deeply embedded in different crises, as the EU is now, are not always on their own guilt, Britain ’ s own agenda with divided concessions, and disturbing treaty changes that they mostly do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it may not, either if it jeopardizes social protection.
We might also call it Dave and Georges Self-Fieh ’ s agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers are climbing for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, photographing a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then coming home and saying that they win allies for reform.
I am always at stake.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain to inside the EU Catch - "Don't just do with France," tells us, says Berlin - and shows that more and more shortsighted ministers and civil servants in some capitals have come to the point that they don' t care whether to stay or go.
Germany ’ s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for them, as happened in excessively long (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
France ’ s François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a diminishing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalistic right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the self-made British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK, something that they do not want because most similar separatist tendencies are.
As a result, some such ministers may not even deliberately plan to help, entirely on the SNP-style level, while Britain ’ s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit-Process Process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was a default," and "Britain has not gained any value from renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense, and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They can be weak in remembering Boris Johnson, the Archdup Euro Opportunists, who made themselves a name a "EU Gerade-Bananis" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990's.
In all of his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the Medley of tax hacking, telephone hacking foreigners, and non-inhabitants ’ pseudo, most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot Gorilla, you are distributed better bananas to divert him rather than become his lunch and evening.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron ’ s referendum economist, for Blair had set the principle of the EU ’ s unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
Nor did the press abandon him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a benign slap on his back on the month of Westminster on Monday -- I told him that he had no time to waste for me -- seems at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock ’ s Boycott Murdoch ’ s strategy of the 80 ’ s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyni ’ s official position on Europe is in development – I say it is benign.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Now, most people outside Ukip ’ s traditional breadth of black fuel and the wild associations of Tory ’ s micro-Englishism may say yes.
It is what Hilary "One Benn, but not a Bennite," Benn on radio, and on television this week, when the plant inventor was fighting in him, not admitting that Corbyni's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadow changer was a bad idea.
I was reminded of the 1970 ’ s, when his old father sought television to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary ’ s struggle was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "in all circumstances -- Benn's term -- was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contenders and legislators, after all reports on their Montagal clarification.
Whatever Corbyn's strange bottom-up image, consider that he even touched me, news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock, and before all things in the social media, a breeding ground of paranoia, and treason.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to consider Labour ’ s support in the referendum campaign self-evident, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns are no longer only a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of the small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
Like his ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is clearly convinced that no JC is launching a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be required to try to make sense of their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, including distrust voters, to make concessions to the British if all of this can be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed by weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even with a cut in the cost of the Tories government, as I was reminded of what Britain ’ s Influence Security Forum called at the start of Monday.
Experts criticize the Public Health England Report on E-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less damaging than smoking were based on a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released last month's "Basic Report," describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the data ’ s resilience, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily dark basis" on which the PHE established its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in the BMJ and asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on proof efficacy."
They said that the public expects the PHE ’ s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarette smoking is about 95% less damaging than smoking is based on a detailed examination of evidence and the model.
Indeed, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for multiple criteria of decision-making analysis (MCDA) to produce a synthesis on the damage of various nicotine-hall products, and the meeting ’ s findings were captured in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euross Health, whose CEO was supposed to receive an independent study from British Tobacco (BAT).
He also signed the BAT ’ s public-health credentials in a sustainable report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to obtain funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he previously was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for choosing the panel ’ s members are not met, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of which also instruct an industry funding in paper.
Some other participants at the meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting involved the PHE ’ s tobacco management.
The group's research "is tellingly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage to most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
Yet none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarette smoking is a way to smoke children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wealth at PHE, said that the BMJ ’ s claims were already responded before.
"E cigarettes are far less damaging than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that e-cigarette health risks are small compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term impact.
PHE has a clear duty to educate the public about what the evidence shows, and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers relative to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion per year.
We fulfill our national responsibilities with the clear pretense of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking.
BBC Should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4
Luke Johnson, the former chairman of Channel 4, has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to heat hows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcaster should be used only to make the kind of programs that other users do not endow.
He criticized the BBC for placing public programs that are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience in hard-contested time windows against their rivals ’ most popular showings and senators like BC4.
After Tony Hall, the BBC Director-General, said that he wanted to do more with other organizations in partnership with the company, Johnson said that he had worked with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC mandates or sends programs clearly displayed by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the High House Communication Committee in his investigation of the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the broadcaster in the medium or long run, you should at least consider your production to programs that others do not or give a job.
They send The Voice at a first-rate time window, because they want to achieve the most widespread support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke; it is ridiculous, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax is financed, and that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program; EastEnders is another, admittedly both self-productive.
To be sure, other channels would give their right arm.
I see how this should be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is responsible for ratings because of "the aspirations of the people working there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what former Sky CEO Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell Shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public niche programs should "go to BBC4, where the audience can not be measured, but they do their tasks, and they can argue that if they go to their seemingly sacred missions to justify £4 billion," we have now, of course, implemented all of these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
They put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
As Johnson told the Committee, "I call on you to find a more regressive system of conditionality for who can get the best value.
Of course, all of us think that you get a big value for $150 billion a year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, I wonder if this is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chairman David Elstein, also testified before the Commission on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate, and maintain."
He said that little of BBC production is now officially classified as an education - he said that 1% of its TV production and 0.1% in radio - and that it should be an example of public television channels in Australia and Canada. "
When it comes to partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Prom, which he said was revealed only a handful on television, and with the commercial senators, to make alliances available online.
``Sonogenetics' Can Tax Brain Valley cells
The video shows how the nematods change the direction at the moment when they are punished with clans.
Scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by swaps.
The tiny nematods are changing the direction at a moment when they are punished with clangills that have too much pleasure to be heard.
The impulse is working through the invention of motoneon cells genetically modified to carry the memo channels that respond to ultra-waves.
Again, researchers read and write lights about brain activity
The researchers said that worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, in which ultra-screen can be used to activate a variety of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the case may one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive process that gives electoral impetus to the brain to treat the symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease.
Farmers typically do not respond to Ultrashall, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
Bubble bubbles, he found, reinforce the ultra-waves that then enter the worms.
The heightened wave of ultraviolet waves affects structures called TRP 4 ion channels and found in memory industries by some of the strangers.
The waves make these ion channels open, and activate the cells that they allocate, Nature Communications reports.
Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of its motongue regions carry TRP 4 Ionia.
When he applies Ultrashall to the changing creatures, micro-soil waves are amplified and transferred to the dignity of the modified motoneons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a path-breaking tool that allows scientists to dismantle neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technology.
Contrary to light, which must be sent to the brain on an optical façade, low-frequency ultraviolet waves of tissue can happen freely, and thus can be sent to the brain from above.
"We believe that gene therapy and therapeutic virus can make targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultra-screen clinical attitude to certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could be concentrated in muscle cells and inmate cells, he added.

Britain ’ s Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Armed Armed Forces Messen-video.
Distrust Drones
Football Shrugging Bell!
Stream!
And electric shoots that cause agging pain do not leave!
The flimsy voice and cartoon pictures have no doubt that this newspaper is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government ’ s willingness to release arms to repressive regimes via the default and Security Epquiment International Jamboree in London ’ s Dockland ’ s Executive Centre.
Put: DSEI Arms Messe: Authoritarian regimes are pouring into London
But a separate campaign also leads to many placates that can be seen in buses and in the subway traits, which require a second glance.
"Major announcement: D15-18 September?" (Dockland ’ s Light Railway) is read in the London Underground and the hallmark of the DLR, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a blackmail of arms deals with the DLR will go …. Customers are asked to help freeze arms abuse.
The 300 placates are artists who have put their work in the museum for cruel design in Banksy ’ s disorder.
A colleague called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London, using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a $6 billion pack of inbatigues claiming that "access to about one-third of bus-producing space on the planet."
Transportation for London does not find these players -- "Vandalism."
One of the parodie evidence produced by Special Patrol Group has been.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator of Crueol Designs and Dozent at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to make political work to the audience outside of Galeries.
Many artists are working with activists in protest movements, noting that they must go out in the real world to make their art influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms placates greeted the subway.
The Amnesty video was seen more than 100,000 times over Facebook in 24 hours, and was created by the VCCP ’ s advertising agency, which works with the graph and Voicece.artist, which also works freely.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed about the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fame -- by a League of the Executive CeL-Kalenger -- and thought that "Let us give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of more realistic corporate advertising, but "it remains more arrested by the hallmarks of hell color and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the mass," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What is needed now is an intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture appliances will not be illegally acted on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the gun mass comes from within the area of Executive, where manufacturers display fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a lecture from the US army about "the AT4CS, completed by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely formed combat card, which produces outstanding domestic adverse effects."
Whatever that happens, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Home
Ten years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-older, I was still in a student ’ s habit, still in the belief of mountains and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I have resented – and the many long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be consolidated in eight simple rules.
Training in student homes ranges from slightly nervous to utterly terrifying.
It is tempting to flourish: people tell you where you are, whether and where you hate Sabbatb year after year, where you are on Corbyn, and why, “honestly, you don't love or hate Marmite, because it is only a Hefew HAHA, I am in my room. ”
Do you go through.
And you help others to do the same thing - raise questions and show your interest.
It draws the conversation and helps you find people who you may, unlike those with whom you would not speak, even if your wreckage was burned and those fire blocs were firewall.
Let ’ s leave people.
People ’ s inconsistencies are often transformed into beaches, film night, and communal meetings, but they are also the places where people move and their underlaunderlaundering.
Think about this: Don ’ t think about starting in the Uni with a Relations
Introverted people receive crude treatment at university.
Their room should be a refugium, but many student habits form a spacecraft culture that is benign and socially friendly and can lead to life-long friendship.
This may be the hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you go away, so I retain the energy I have spent on the interaction with you."
Think of when a commilitant is exhausted -- sending him a SMS rather than an applause.
Apropos accuse: Take it.
A candle in my student habit had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Freedom is closed by backs.
As you start the uni at the peak of the back mania, the clothes on the doors of people to imagine themselves full of brownies are less strange than the greening of the 1950s "Welcome in the neighborhood, I have smiled you somewhat." Now ask for a few personal questions. "
Providing homegrown sticks is a good way to close friendships.
Their fellow citizens feel obliged to stand up and, in the end, may socialize their face with an empty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent bag.
Possibly mixed mehl, sugar, and fat clumes make people sleeping when you are acclaiming.
stealing food is a common crime in student habits.
Of course, cooling chickens is a theft, but is it a throphy of milk for your tea?
Think of this with the dairy owner.
The odds are that they say they are using themselves, even if they cook internally.
When someone chooses your keys, this is angry, and you have my compassion - but you try to deal more evenly than my fellow person, who added a spell to her milk to punish thieves.
It is now in jail.
They should not be warm that keeps people from fighting or working.
It is not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the true sense, one of the people in the Glass House.
A girl on my ride asked her neighbor whether they make it easier to make steam and barrel slightly, because it was three a.m., and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally listened at 5 a.m., happily, they left their neighbors slaughtered for two hours before they let their own music burst, closed their door, and asked for their triple examination.
Wouldn ’ t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally entered the same student ’ s home?
Conversely, it would not be abundantly embarrassing if you have to keep your future spouse of your husband, rank to them, return to them, and perhaps see them every day, and see them as having all common friends?
Of course, the heart of his own paths - but if a hot inhabitor is definitely not your future spouse, you at least try to give your misery some reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone is in his unfinished room, the line between Ulk and Mobbing is fine than it seems.
A good match is fine, but it takes only a moment to be bumerous.
Do you share a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding you -- but you never contaminated with Zahnpasta and Shampoo.
If you close your door and put your key to a glass of water that you put in your seat - but don't attend their possessions on the ceiling twice.
Travel Hospitals for Refugees, Allende, Low-Payers
Markus Gildner, the real-estate contractor, is building up for people who do not have much money in the median ethanol.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income earners."
"I show how to build cheap and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push for the housing market.
The businessman Markus Gildner believes that it can be created quickly, building in a project of rice houses for refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner – Mass shelter in containers or tournaments has no sustainability.
People remain in large part here.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A totally banal three-shaken rice house is the solution.
Gildner – A rice house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
This is different from putting people in residential blocs.
Each of the six houses that are currently built in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum-seekers.
Every unit of homes has two battlefields, a ball, a coastal, and a residential area.
It may be that many refugees will say; it is again peace, I go back.
Then houses can easily be rebuilt for their respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner – The price of 160 square meters of residential space per house amounts to €184 million, without a basic point.
This is manageable.
Six months have taken the construction.
This is appropriate.
Are construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have properly endured my project.
It always complicates the looming sword of Damocles and proxy.
Gruselig.
At least three positions are still being submitted to who creates three homes in a rice house.
Only cities lack that place.
And refugees and asylum-seekers do not have cars.
How did residents respond to their rice home project?
Gildner – There were those who accused me of creating luxury building for asylum-seekers.
What is definitely wrong.
But don ’ t you exacerbate competition for affordable housing?
Gildner – True, we have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but we have built luxury homes that few can afford it.
My project has the message, and ordinary people also need housing.
Not only refugees, but so do the single mother or the low-income earner.
I show how to build cheap and well today.
That is why.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro-systemic engineering in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
IOS 9: How to preserve the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is published
The new operating system can be called for by entering the hiring app, weighing on "general," and then elaborating "software."
If it is willing, the telephone will give you the option of downloading and then installing.
Some have faced problems after installation, because they receive a misreporting that "software actualization has failed."
To avoid the problem, users will recommend waiting either for the rush to go back or try to update iTunes.
The telephone himself leads you by the rest of the process.
This may mean the hole of Apps in order to create space, but Apple has made it less likely by prolonging the Updates, and it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to annihilate and install apps once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your cell phone is invited during rectualization, or near a school device, so that the battery is invited.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, because the telephone may cut off halfway, leading to a drop in the Updates.
Again, IOS 9 Releases still read in the timetable, despite the WatchOS 9: the least exciting but still best date of iOS 9: how to prepare for the new iPhone operating system.
They should also ensure that you have seen our checklist of things off your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do. OS 9 brings new functions, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for iPad, just as changes that accelerate and fix the operating system.
Rosberg ’ s Only Devise: Volle Attacks
Nico Rosberg knows only one devise in the fight for the World Cup ’ s title 1: "Volle Attacks."
The WM-Second stressed before the start in the crucial seven overseas race, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the Vice World Cup champion from Singapore ’ s successor to the next day in Singapore on this Sunday of Title Defense and double-champion Hamilton.
The British won seven of the previous twelve seasons, and also attacked the flutterly grand prix in the urban state as a favorite.
In 2009 and the past year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
It is still unclear whether the current mog in the city state will influence Singapore ’ s great price.
For days, a navy over the town, triggered by fires on neighboring Sumatra, has been around.
Bad Kissinger ’ s Chess club has a prominent Members
The chess club, established three months ago by Bad Kissingen, added another member to his ranks, so membership increased to 19 players.
The new member is the businessman Paul Gauselmann, a passive chess and tennis actor who stood up more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselman is a provider of the 1 th Class and Honor citizens of the town of EspelChap and La.
The Bad Kissingen chess club supported Gauselmann with a donation that met Chairman Alfred Klein.
This will allow chess players who can not deliver on membership.
Youth workers and talent searches should also be driven forward.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club of "red whites" is seen as reflecting his connectivity to the Kurdish town.
The Quartet Office Takes Direct Contact
Saludis and the Antonist elderly center have rallied under the staff of the Social Foundation and opened a new job in grave place.
They can also participate in courses, alongside consultations.
Social firepower draws from mountains to inland.
More precisely, the Graf Storage Square is.
There, a new quartile office was recently opened.
Here, immediately next to the shopping market, Seniors and advice seekers get information about issues such as health insurance or health care and care providers.
For years, we have found ourselves with our ambulant care service that many people are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Nor do many of the cronies' achievements rarely materialize because the complexity of the insurance is barely understood," the new homeowner Jutta Weigand, who, as CEO of business, is also responsible for the antonist and mayor's chief, and the ambassador's "Amadeus."
In addition to the deliberations, the new quartile office also provides prevention, health, and Wellness to prevention.
That was where Saludis was taken on board.
Thus, additional supplies, such as storage prevention, memory engineering, or physiotherapy, can be used.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis are ideally complementary.
Saludis stand for prevention, preparedness, and Reha.
"Senior Center for care and care," Sake Riedel, the senior executive of Saludis, voiced.
Both business leaders look particularly at demographic change, owing to the opening of the new quartile office in the city ’ s inner town.
For this would make good decentralized infrastructure essential in the particular parts of Bamberg in the future.
Moreover, as highlighted as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the summit of participation, the Quartism Office also devoted itself to the age of Age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program, and these are regularly accessible."
This would make a major contribution to the social services that the elderly can live as selectively and well in their familiar environment.
The Quartet Office is open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of 9 to 14, Tuesday and Thursday, from 16-18 a.m. to 12 a.m., and from 10.
Bamberg runs against Wutburger Kickers on October 6.
It is now true: after rehabilitation worked at the FC ’ s meeting of the third most religious Wamburger Kickers, the FC ’ s meeting was not yet set as a date, October 6 was set.
The FC ’ s encounters have now finally been minimized by Bamberg in the axis of the Bavaria football topokal against the third most religious FC, Wutburger.
Photographed at October 6, on the service day, 19 a.m., in Bamberger Fucharkdion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going on, we now have planning safety," FCE-team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who points to the now launched card sale.
It is special for our team to play against a third religious one.
So we hope for many viewers, and not without reason, because floods have a special allure.
In the Round of the last 16 teams, the FC convened Bamberg in 2010 by winning at the 1. FC U. (3: 1), and at home against the regional religious religions 1. FC gathered in 05 (3: 2).
The competitor ’ s winner receives €5,000 and qualifies for the DFB ’ s first round of 2016-2017 United Nations.
Title Defenders are third sites of spy underhacking.
The Death of Vienna ’ s Charter Karl Mang 92 Years
Karl Mang, one of the doyen of Vienna ’ s architecture, is dead.
He died at the age of 92, on September 5, as the artist House told on the day.
With time, the artist house lowers a member, while "one of the most important architects of the second half of the twentieth century in Vienna," as was said in the expiration.
Bringing in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the technical school in Vienna during and after World War II, Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he has worked as a liberating architect, but has also been a teacher, writer, and institution director.
From 1972 to 1983, he was president of the Austrian Institute for Former Forum.
In the 1980 ’ s, he was sent to the establishment of the Chamber of Finance in Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobywood into the Austrian theatereum.
Parking: Tim Vienna accuses policeman of Money
Tim Vienna ’ s ex-football player has been ruthless.
Football was once involved, now Tim Viese, ex-national prosecutors in Germany, and Bremas and Hophemia, Wrestler.
He wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle over the past two years, according to his own statement.
By contrast, he has not intellectual.
The hawks were barely cut in the Bremer City of Vienna when he saw a Parkinson Guardian exhibit for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Viese then rushed out of business, insulated the civil servant, and thwarted her against the "picture" of the newspaper.
The town of Bremen confirms the allegations, but does not yet understand the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The cause is still in the test," says Bremer City.
Only afterwards will Vienna be revealed, or not.
Panama ’ s Officials destroyed 4500 marijuana plants
Isla del Rey ’ s fertile soil and regenius climate are best suited to marijuana plants.

Men Ten Years of Afghans
The police are searching for an incident in Bad Soden Salmonasters: three young men were traveling on their way to Salmonster at the Friday, against 23,45.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, was, according to the police, following his two friends in a section of about five meters and telling them that they were waiting for him.
At that point, the group was at the height of the bad guard.
Three people also stood up in the tanks ’ command.
One of these men now wrote to the young, and put them in the face of the fist.
The victim suffered a nasal breakdown, greatly destroying it.
When his two friends raised and appeased to the blow, he initially abandoned his victim.
His friends now brought the wounded young man home.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a pkw up to its apartment, demonstrably giving way to multiple ends.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injury to the building went to smooth a cigarette.
There, he was again attacked by the plague and another male person.
Under the auguration of a slogan, one looked at the face and the victim ’ s supremacy.
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far, only a vague description has been.
One man was about 1.80 meters large.
The second player was supposed to have been around 1.65 meters large, and was suffering from a Jean and a brown white shird.
The police are asking the executives to report under the telephone number of 061/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes practice and invests €3,000
Silvia Mumber Gongoll and Frank Müller (of the left) take the case of Karl-Heinrich and the Ursel.
Likewise, Samter Commander-General Bernd Bormann, Uta Seim-Schwartz, and Asendorkovych ’ s mayor, Heinfried Kabbert, enjoy this.
In many places in the country, doctors lack it - Asendorkovych is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes the field on October 1.
While the hour crops are retired, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still half his successor in the next few months.
After a turnaround period, trouble resumes the practice on October 12, when it invests €3100,000 in the St.-Marcellus 6 rail.
It was sympathy at first sight when the field of Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Mumoll, announced that they now want to complete their expertise in the verted hospital and enter practice next year.
"We have always had in mind that the waters would fit this practice well," says Dr. Ursel, and burn.
"When it did, I simply called them."
The spouse of a couple of botherers had the idea of taking their own practice in the future in Asendorf.
"The proximity and contact with the patient are very attractive," says the 39-year-old bother.
"We want to know and accompany families over the years."
He also seeks to be his own leader soon.
And so it became unified; the garbage houses bought the house with practice.
But they will continue to be in mere houses.
There, Frank Müller, a double-family father, has also grown up, his medical school in Hover, followed by stations in several medical boxes, and hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg, and Rotenburg.
He is now a chief practitioner in smoke, was also appointed to lead Diepholz in 2009, and has been honestly committed to breach houses in the DRC ’ s willingness.
From September 19, the practice is being prepared for the new leader.
Whereas the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felsteel is working as a house doctor, his Gaturine Ursel (Internet) has specialized himself in the host rollology.
The garbage, both internists, wants to be crushed as a house doctor.
"So the Endosky is coming out," says Silvia Mumber Gongoll, 38-year-old.
After reconstruction, the trees will look more modern.
We will offer more Ultrashell examination, long-term and resilient KGs, and we need more.
Moreover, the EDV will be fully renewed.
A total of €500,000 ($25,000) grant is given the garbage through a rural production program ($25,000), as well as the Samtpound ($12,000) and the community ($12,500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues," he emphasizes Saturday General Chair Bernd Bormann.
Roughly 2,000 patients come into practice each quarter, according to Silvia Mumber Gongoll, in which the north German average practice is about 500.
There is another house practice in Asendorf.
Frank Müller ’ s takeover of practice is a positive side effect: the pharmaceutical remains in the field, according to Judge.
If no successor had found himself, she would have gone.
Anyone who visits the spotlight screens, after all, still finds himself in familiar terms: the seven medical professionals and the cleanup power of the field.
With its departure ending in Asendorf, physicians have practiced it for 30 years.
"At the beginning, we had only two trees," he recalls his chorus.
They have a bit of joke for a long time.
"But we continue to live in high moor and certainly still many patients," says the Internet.
"We have a 60,000 square meters of ground."
"So far, I have always shielded myself from garment, but now this may be different."
Moreover, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We Leave the Refugees by"
"Now border controls are being put up on our southern border," says Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Gardener.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel with that.
It is still clear that anyone seeking asylum applications could make this "self-evident."
People ’ s provision and security is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "that it needs strong signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless flows of migration, including the Austria-Slovak border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia\ u0027s No-Corridor ” Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously agreed, Slovenia wanted to travel to Austria and Germany, and perhaps to build corridors for refugees.
But so did Interior Minister Vesna Györi ’ s Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia would intensify monitoring the border -- particularly Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an outsider of the Schengen Area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenin does not want to remove his borders on refugees.
"Every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations; otherwise, the system can not work," Györs Znidar emphasized.
As the Croatian government told it, in the aftermath of the day of the day, the first refugees would have attempted to step up in eastern Croatia on the Tovarnik/Sid border to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could attack them in the near maize fields.
According to the local media, police vehicles have consistently met with new refugees in Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It is mainly around Syrians and Afghans, many of them women and children.
Relief agencies and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects some 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Moreover, Presevo buses on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
But Belgrade's government denied that it is like people to take certain routes: "Neither we can nor do," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid, at least in the early h, would have arrived at the end of the day, with more business expected.
Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on their way all night from Serbia ’ s 500-mile maznon border.
"We heard that Hungary was allowed, so the police told us that we should go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to go to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria.
This may actually be the result of a slightly more Western-style twist of the previous Balkan route to Turkey ’ s Macedoni-Hungary.
Croatia: "Comprehensive Limits to Border Control
Croatia ’ s interior minister, Ostojic, had earlier emphasized that his country has prepared plans for possible exceptional situations if refugees are strong.
He did not call details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive opportunities to control borders."
Strong controls are being introduced to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area.
Slovenia belongs to it since 2007, with EU partners consistently showing the country a good record on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, roughly 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing, which led to ruled.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two frontiers remain completely imprisoned by Horgos and Backi Breg.
Whether the remaining refugees want to go to the Croat border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure Wednesday early on in a Local Caucasus scene in Horgos: he considers debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not now be very high levels of refugees.
One can not yet say whether they would continue their journey on Hungary, Croatia, or another country.
Help Rise Migrants - Dangerously - Alternatives
But private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing to the refugee cards on which alternative routes are recorded by Croatia.
But the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not undangerous: there are still no settled minefield in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatian War.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minerals was sent in the border region.
Stock Hacker: Ukrainians Pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have been a ranking of cyber criminals, accused of repeatedly returning to unpublished financial reports and press releases on Web sites like Business Wire, Marketwired, and PR Newscreens since 2010.
Insider deals in financial markets were supposed to have been made with the information that was exploited.
According to this, more than $100 million was spent on the investigators as a whole.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured," says SECC.
The trials against 32 more allegations continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted out of both the US and Eastern Europe.
Mannheim ’ s Ecumenical Hospice Aid for 20 Years
There is real business around the Mannheimer Paradez Square.
People do their concerns, partly quick steps, in part humbled.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon in the first place.
City trajectories are here.
Four big barrels each with the headline, "Before I am dying..."
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid made this effort a notable focus on its 20-year existence, and it is well confronted with mixed responses.
"It's life, so we have gone to the town and the people in the midst of action," Joseph Fine Lammer says.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to the passersmen for issues and talks, as well as to honorable officials.
While some passport spontaneously champions the circle, supplementing the phrase "of my life," reading "reading" with US clouds, "stopping the war," or "not suffering long," others remain brief, reading "I am still not," and going on.
Time and again, small discussions about action are emerging, on the verge of life, about how to deal with death.
Peter Hübinger, too, is on the ground.
"Only when I realize that the end of the world is coming to my day can I live accountable," I say Director of Mannheim ’ s Director, Mannheim, who is alongside the Caritasan Association of Ecumenical Hospice.
As a result, this 20-year-old public-relations approach is good.
But it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the table; after all, it is a very personal matter.
The issue of death and death remains taboo, Joseph Lammer ’ s experience, though the hospice movement in recent years has done much to make people open.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning accompanying is one of the honorable staff of the first hour.
Faced with personal experience with the issue, they lure a lot of literature and chose to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought honor by calling, it immediately reported itself, and had been there when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honor amendments - 43 women and two men - that accompanies household beds and family members, hospitals, nurses, and Hospiz Sant Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her job and the experiences and experiences that he reported.
"I see life from another, consider it precious, and estimate the moment," she says.
The ambulent Ecumenical Service ’ s offer is free and non-sectarian.
Financial support for the health community and donations of family and association enables training, training, and supervisions of the death and trauma accomplishments.
Every two years, training for new workers is offered.
The tafes described on Saturday are now present in the House of the Ethiopian Church (M1, 1a) and in the Catholic Church ’ s House (F2, 6).
There, too, more personal wishes can be listed on postcards.
Making up Fedo ’ s Things to Slower Financial Prospects in 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant reduced its profit sight to a full year, owing to weaker demand for secondary services and higher cost in its ground service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 5,000 seasonal workers for the vacation.
At that point last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation period.
Events fell more than 2.5% in Pmarket-trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said that earning a gain of $10.40 to $10.90 in the business year ending next May will be less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected FactSet to see $10.84.
The lower prospect comes despite the 4.9% price increases on average and will be effective on January 4, and, despite higher blackmail applications for heavy and large packages made by November.
Yet the company said that it was expected to increase the result of last year ’ s cost cut, higher revenues, and online growth.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "yields solid returns by considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The plan for vacation employment was announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, who plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, such as the same number last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than last year.
The result ever was $2.42 per activist, just below $2.44 per share, which 12 analysts asked for Zack ’ s investment research.
The sales rose by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been declining in recent years in the international prioritization sand that has stagnated the sales in his unity of extortion.
But the online shopping boom has increased the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales to land transport rose 29%, but the operational result was essentially flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
Express unity generated higher revenues because of higher prices, while the result of higher labor costs in the secondary business.
In Pmarket-trading, about one hour before the opening, fedge stocks fell by $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On the service day, they lost 11% for the year and 17% below a record high on June 11.
At its most expected meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve spent Strategen two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagon table to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threats to them are a picture of the United States at an end to the abandoned two-dimensional session.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will place the nation ’ s economic interests ahead of all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximizing US employment and prices here.
But, since the Great Recession, the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the factor of X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It is announced on the Donors ’ Day that the US economy is willing to be rewarded by the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy ’ s data show that they grow stronger, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the Fed ’ s already cautious representatives anxious to increase volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds, if only one-quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at the macro firm Silver Nicolaus & Co, said.
"But I think that if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which itself unsettles the financial market.
Roughly half of the economists recently asked by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of raising.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the sentence unless the strategists ameliorate the blow by promising that another increase is far from coming.
On the service day, the Dow Jones Industrial Party received an average of 28.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.59.85.
This week ’ s move was triggered by expectations that the Fed ’ s policy will maintain the phrase, John London, Chief Economist at Moody ’ s Capital Markets Research Group, said.
It would be a surprise that the Fed would raise rates by that time, "he said.
If it does, "it would have to go very far in its declaration to calm financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that raising interest rates would calm financial markets, because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said this spring and summer that, despite the grievances of liberals that more economic progress would be required, she expected to increase the sentence this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, improvements in the labor market this year were sound.
The unemployment rate plummeted to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and near Level, which the Fed regards as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And, while inflation was consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, Fed officials said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and need them because of labor-market friction," says Ian Sheparddson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world came together late last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered this month, with the Dow now close to 10% below the May peak.
For Fed officials, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If events in financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks," Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former Fed staff, said.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to manage the impact.
"There is plenty of uncertainty about what the US economy will have, and there is almost no reliable data describing what developments in China," Oliners said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed ’ s main concerns, so it should not be involved in its decision-making.
But, in the end, the Fed has become the world ’ s monetary authority.
The central bank ’ s influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult themselves with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Its decision-making is "more art than science," Zachary Karabell, the director of the global strategy for Envested Inc ’ s asset management, said.
Jeffrey Lacker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, observed this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reacting to financial-market movements that seem not linked to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a right-wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee, voted for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "he said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England Interest-Rate Committee.
The latest turmoil is not near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate hike because markets are exciting," Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not believe that it should take time to do so.
Do you need a brave Thai market?
Take LAX-C in China.
Yes, China
The market/camp was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often called Thai Costco, and is a large Thai trade market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinese, not Thai Town.
The market/the camp is a central location, offering a confusing number of fresh, frozen, and dry goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and siren, furniture, furniture, religious smuggling, and Christmas.
There is even an automobile department when you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to shine through it.
If the whole shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal time at the LAX-C BQ express.
The rubble (good and cheap) in this store is close to the coffers, and it has several co-options.
What is there: do you need something, anything, Thai?
LAX-C is likely.
Products are cheap, and a large number of them are sold.
Friends products include Asian specialties and regional Thai power, fruits, and much more.
The meat screens are extensive, as are fish screens, and the staff behind the theast will clean up and filease the fish, even wishing for you.
A good part of the burden belongs to the massive fresh department, where you find frozen currency floors, bitter melone and galgant, all ends, fish, cattle blood, and gales, pore natural darm, fishing, fishing valleys, regional roots, commercial food, and more.
Those who buy it: restaurants and minds, including individual families and individuals.
The broad gimmicks are suitable for shopping and garbage bags.
They find here: fresh Monthong Durian alongside the casualties.
Where he finds himself, the store is in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the verge of Chinese and domestic town – a few blocs away from Filipino The Original.
Park: LAX-C has its own parks, together with other deals and restaurants.
Even if the Laden is well visited, it is not hard to find a parking square.
Hoyerading: Small Life Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
Bringing them warm will is not without the involvement of countless honorable heroes.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerungan, who support impartial asylum-seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Hein.
Petra Hone is a teacher with breath and soul.
They still like to learn with their 74 lapses.
Every Thursday, she does it at the asylum seekers at home.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo, and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is very different lessons than at a right school.
Brazil ’ s Pädiatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for Healthy Silence
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is shockingly trying to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during the deadlock period, and is doing so with the presentation of babies who clean up on breeders who are filled with images of unhealthy foods.
Parent milk consists of a variety of proteins, fat, vitamins, and carbon hydrates that give babies all nutrients needed to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers will come to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories a day.
But new research suggests that higher calorie demand is not the only dietic adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study headed by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy nutrition actually affects their babies ’ genes and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the Sporthal ’ s New Berners
The Commonwealth of Bernried approved the construction bid for the €2.3 million ($2.3 million) sports.
And he was an exception.
Dach can become more flat for solar panels.
Plans for longstanding tournament construction at the Bernernerners ’ Sports are are proceeds by step: in the recent joint meeting, the processed construction bid without much discussion was approved.
Before that, the panel had, among other things, approved a request for a commercial "exception" respectable "liberation" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form of diess design.
So a "satellite date with non-commonplace First and Dacheity" is to be built.
The purpose of planning is to use the area of solar panels: "This brings together a wonderfully large South Asia," Joseph Steigenberger declared at the meeting.
The "liberation" was about, in turn, the envy to be less than ten degrees, for energetic reasons, unlike the construction plan.
This greatly reduces the volume of hair.
"liberation" was needed because the construction plan for digestion does not allow "exceptions" – with the community's Bernanke typically restricting liberation.
But tournament construction is not a returning project: "We do not set a precedent," says Stranger.
Turnover building at the sports center is a joint project by the community and the SV Bernried.
At a cost, about €2.3 million is calculated.
Subsidies are expected to be promoted by training and broadband.
In the next trial, the 18-36 meters of construction is now being submitted to the country office for examination.
Clinics PeiV Goes to Schongau
The hospital of Peiroberg is supposed to be closed sooner than planned – 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become a new medical director in the hospital of Schongau.
The Station and the majority of staff move from Peiroberg to Schongau.
This envisages the surprise plans of the hospital GmbH, which confirmed the countryside council Andrea Jochner-shelf.
But a decision is made on the board, and it is on September 23.
If the plans are implemented, all of the nearly 50 workers at the hospital would be employed in Peiroberg.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the remaining internal station.
The trees are there.
Jochner-white is said to be offered to workers who can not be offered to Schongau in Weilheim.
The staff are informed about plans.
The change has dissolved the release of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the director of the Shanghai clinic since the beginning of the year, now shifting to a private practice closer to the hospital.
When it comes to who will succeed, according to Jochner-Weich, the name "fishermen" who agreed to take the lead on October 1 and change his team to Schongau.
In any case, this meant "appreciation" and broadening the supply of "internal medicine," Jochner said.
Fischer is a specialist for cardiovascular and deficit brilliant.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes on domestic station for gather-based diseases.
Transitional for the next two years, Fischer is said to lead both houses with his team if the board agrees to them, until next year, the former hospital of scarcity, which still has 35 beds, is to be finalized in Peikberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the countryside had planned this for 2018, when the current hospital cleanup is completed.
Land commander Jochner-Weich, also chairman of the Board of Governors, countered rumors that the house owned by Germany ’ s scarcity will be used as a subsidy for asylum-seekers.
"I exclude this." How the home goes on could not say that there are several considerations.
Today, the caritas and a daily psychiatry are being subjected to short-time care.
"What the better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," Fischer said about the quasi-move to the League, which was "positive and very understandable" by the staff.
There has been no real perspective on the house in which Fischer has worked as a chief color for more than 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take the post of the medical director.
The hospital of Peiroberg (once 100 beets) has been threatened repeatedly in recent decades, with departments closed, such as surgery and birth assistance.
Rhein-Newen ’ s henchmen now call for dinner (20.15 a.m.) at the Bercipal HC.
While Wuppertal is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, the tablet leader of the Federal League has no reason for hubris.
In the last season, the BHC ’ s backers took a painful defeat and have something to do.
Prague ’ s Two Injuries
Roots have severely wounded two tractor drivers during their maize appointees at the service afternoon.
During the advisory of a maize at Pratau (Wittenberg countryside), several hunts were used in the way the police shared.
After a showdown, a 63 and 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals.
At first, it was not clear how the accident could occur.
Criminal police are identified.
Missing 16-year-old Rhineland Victims of Violence Crimes
One suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds who have been missing since Saturday from Rhineland.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-older admitted to have killed young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in rock.
A 16-year-old of Rhineland, who has been missing since Samday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman ’ s body was found in emperor slaughter at the service meeting in Rockenhsen, as prosecutors and police shared on Wednesday.
A 20-year-older who was also deemed to be a suspicion of the service, who, indeed, was under the charge and led investigators to the field of the body.
The 16-year-olds had been reported on Sunday ’ s day, after they had not come home on the eve of a visit to Rockenhsen on the eve of a visit.
In the search of the young woman, investigators initially met with personal objects to the victim.
After all, surveys of the plight and acquaintance circle of the missing were suspected of the 20-year-olds.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a rock hoax channel where the body was found.
The arrested, according to the authorities, admitted in police interrogation that they killed 16-year-olds and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-olds should be conducted on Wednesday, and the investigators put him at the burden.
More investigations are supposed to be made out of the nearer circumstances of the act.
Refugees need shelter: Studies warn of Home Gap
The situation in the German housing market is strained.
More and more refugees are also searching for affordable meat.
Domestic pressures are mounting.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The German housing distribution struggles have long begun.
With the EU ’ s coming refugees and job seekers, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
The result is a study of the Association's "Social Housing Built."
For comparison, in Germany this year, 260,000 units will be finished.
This lacks 140,000 homes.
Refugees, after the first three months of their residence, are no longer required to live in a first place in asylum seekers.
Many then enter the housing market and enter the long lines of rental housing.
According to the Office of Statistics, however, less than half of the asylum-seekers were allowed to live last year.
But the housing market ’ s negative performance is not just rising refugee numbers.
The study also makes significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany faces a housing deficit that will grow from year to year.
Currently, some 770,000 residential units were already lacking in the population areas, lamenting Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals were therefore in need of immerse in large cities in WGGC.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slack in the housing market.
In large cities, square meters per capita have fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance of "social housing" proposes a fresh start.
But new incentives are supposed to restore social housing.
For example, the crude value tax could be abandoned, and the basic tax on subsidized housing will be withheld.
Moreover, the Alliance calls for attractive tax depreciation.
KfW ’ s funding program for refugee housing is already well performing in cities and communities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the roughly €300 million ($300 million) was already spent on the month ’ s end of 184 million.
Now, the project could even be scaled up.
Refugees are Free: Croatia and Slovenia are a Corridor
After Hungary, virtually no longer feeds, as more and more refugees vote the way to Croatia.
Zagreb announces giving way through Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
But the road is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with neighboring Slovenia on establishing a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to Slovenia's interior minister, and when necessary, we will organize a corridor," Ranko Ostojic, the Croat Interior Minister.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria, and is already part of the Schengen Zone.
The EU ’ s Croatia country is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian/Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
Five people have reached the Tovarnik border, the Croatian TV station reported RTL.
Hungary had settled its border for refugees on the eve of the day.
New laws that took effect on the same day also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to allow refugees to happen.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said, "You can go through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there; they are women, children, and men who want to live and achieve something.
But it is people who did not want to live in Croatia.
Croatia ’ s police had taken up the first refugees on Serbia ’ s border to neighboring Croatia on the morning.
Most were from Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid with both the bus and Taxen.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have attempted to take root over the Green Frontier to Croatia.
On the Croati-Serbian border, the refugees do not reach border fences.
This poses other dangers to border disputes: there are still sharp minutes from the Yugoslav civil war of the 1990 ’ s.
Mine-room people are now supposed to quickly create a safe passage.
Meanwhile, after the closure of the border, few more refugees come to Hungary.
On the service day, the police included 366 people.
Shortly before torture on Monday, it was 9380.
Hungary ’ s new laws included overcoming and damaging the border fringe as a criminal offense.
Thus, 35 criminal cases were launched in the southern border town of Szeged.
Inmates threaten imprisonment for up to five years, and expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration Agency, on the day of Day, 94 asylum-seekers, almost all - 93 - of them - have been opposed to the most important transfer of smoke.
Among applicants, 13 families are small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday, 40 refugees would have stopped there.
Virtually, however, no one has any prospect of having asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarians, Serbia is a "safe third country."
Determined asylum-seekers should be postponed.
Just a few hundred refugees were gathered before the "transit seats" in evil.
In evil, workers are beginning to clean up.
They rallied the waste that tens of thousands of people had left in the streets in recent weeks.
Sperrgiters were dismantled, and one of the intermediaries in the border was reconstructed.
Nobody wanted to say otherwise.
After closing the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria reaches only a few refugees.
The country has also intensified border controls.
But the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting for the passage to Germany.
Traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the eve of the German authorities ’ instructions.
In free lunch, smaller groups of refugees regularly met.
Mayors Winned "Distranted" over the Frontier
"We were preoccupied with cleansing after the Sunday's bridge-arrest when ten people with travel offerings suddenly entered the fly," Wernya's mayor, Alois urban.
Tourists wanted to go to passenger.
But, because Germany had surprisingly stopped trafficking with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, "he argued," towns immediately offered their help, and the strangers, along with two more heroes and their cars across the Middle East border to Passau.
Before that, we have sued the hopeless guests, with breeding and beating.
We have said the same that we get them to passenu with the car.
"This was self-evident for us," towns in the Oil Talk argue.
They were grateful.
A man could not be allowed to give a generous donation – €100 for the fire defense.
"This has fed us very well," towns say.
The strangled passengers had moved from an ICE to passenger on Sunday ’ s evening in a regional move to a passenger after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany has been stopped but still attempted at the border.
But the regional move was removed at the heart of the Wall ’ s border.
In a serious case, crossing borders is generally high.
The bridge firmly associated with Bavaria's neighbors on Sunday, tags earlier a two-way exercise - organized by the Union of Wserious and New Cirches - on Sunday.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more cigars to us is a logical result of hypocritical policies:
Instead of helping to create structures that ensure humanity in the camp, our chancellor has taken the stance of Hungarian government into the dark circle of Nazism.
Such policies are not just the Austrians who now face messy conditions in the border areas.
The refugees, too, will have to find that the "promised land" that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the ongoing flow of refugees and the nearby winter to build decent conditions for protective seekers.
And it will be even greater - peace, security, and stability in Austria.
Conspirad in the search for 35,000 Winning Quartet
Conspirad has a full hand to do with the refugee settlement.
Christian Conrad is accustomed to his word.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffi banker to set up quartiles for the thousands of refugees.
The mayhem at the traiskirchen first-time center has already gripped Conrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in traiskirks," he reported of his first success.
The shelter of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on the month of the month also said Konrad, praising the organizational "mastery performance."
The Interior Ministry, by contrast, spoke of a "crisis-ridden situation."
Overall, Konrad expects 85,000 quarters of this year.
To meet the number, 35,000 housing needs to be found in the next few weeks – 20,000 countries are supposed to provide, 15,000 of the federal.
If more refugees become, we can do it.
"But it is not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already led to talks with the country ’ s headquarters.
They would have assured him of creating even the coming quartiles.
"It is going well in Austria," Ferry Macker said.
Former VP mandate supports conrad.
There will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will help the Church.
Major expectations also put asylum coordination in the ORF's action of "aid like us."
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated housing.
It also hopes that hotels are empty in the winter.
Conrad and Maians criticized standards for housing as "very high."
On a time of time, quartiles can not be required to maintain some degree of hand holders or size of the upper hand.
For a time to come, "emergency standards" would have to be applied.
That he is more successful, unlike the interior ministry, in bringing down his experience.
I am an older master who is not told the untruth without another.
Confidence is his main weapon.
Conrad and Maians do not impose costs on the Republic as they declared themselves.
They want to increase to 3-4.
Domestic quartiles have not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to present a container on the steam splatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with approval.
Left calls for a Better Divide
For now, open urban sports and other buildings, such as Tips-Arena and Design Center, are planning to provide refugees.
This is not necessary now, because the bears can be done without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
But more locations are to be reviewed for the emergency.
Criticism is the head of the city at the nation-state division of refugees.
Other districts must also contribute.
Seafer: "Limits won't be approved
In a prolonged telephone with Bavaria ’ s Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), President Joseph Pühringer (DP) has corresponded with further refugee action on the month.
Seehofer has told me that Germany ’ s borders will not be abolished.
The return of refugees to the Federal Republic remains possible.
But this is precisely the same border controls.
Special traits to Germany with refugees will not occur for the moment.
But the protectors would be brought to Germany regularly.
Pühringer, among the other EU member states, once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria, too, is reintroducing controls on its borders is a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans.
The Next Runtastic is a Time Question
General rehabilitation of the "new work" in the left-wing industrial era is officially complete.
Four of the six stations of the office and production buildings have been involved in the publicly traded IT company S & T, the rest (2700 square meters) of which is supposed to be bypassed to young, innovative technology companies.
"In IT, the smart minds are our commodity - and we must try to work for us," says S & T Chairman Hannes House.
He could imagine investing in startup new firms, and then acquiescing in them.
From the outset, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbor, which promises much to be made: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested in the location of S & T, $3.3 million from the technocenter, which is one in one-third of the city of Linz, Colonel Austria, and the FTC.
The building has come from the Left AG for 60 years to S & T and technocenter.
30% of the 2700 square meters of residential residence in buildings are already mixed, with another 40% requested.
Lia Peron Inhair opened Two Business in Arcade
In the new shop, there is a focus on broadcasting.
In fact, Jutta wanted to settle for himself.
This effort had to dismantle Lia Peroni ’ s 49-year-old inhabitor in the Taubenk market arcade: after all, it has grown in the form of another business location.
In the sand shop to the business, in which it sells pockets, knives, shoes, and guys of various manufacturers, everything is now around the bre Furla, and money words are worth $75.
Greater pockets and Accessoires cost up to €500.
For yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
Before that, several weeks was reconstructed.
"But I have long considered whether I should open a store," says freely.
The key determinant of the decision was, among other things, that the spin producers in Bologna, who are at home, were also injected by the idea of their own location, where only their handcuffs are sold.
"We are the only people who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Their mother ’ s interest in mother has taken it back.
I do the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some of the women watching a beautiful hand-off can not answer with certainty.
Perhaps it is because a beautiful pocket of any outfit evaluates.
The Brulljesy Power of Calltown
Donald Trump ’ s defaulted ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called servants.
Some also combine this quality with the billionaire that the US president wants to become.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for outrage.
Whether he is xenophobic, journalists stomach, or reveals a lack of knowledge in international crisis politics, the applicant for the US presidency is vigorous.
And it does well.
This is also registered in the Callup town, where the big holders of the real-estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the pleasure is a term for many in the winter ’ s wine roads.
Some in the 1200-home place are more than 80 corners related with him.
His grandfather came from calltown to the false: Donald Trump, in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel, a city city leader, drew a movie about Trump.
And what do villagers think about their goal of becoming the world ’ s most powerful man?
"I think this is somehow exciting, but it is not so deeply impressed in its caste manner," Simone Wendel says.
The celebrated urban callup has turned an amusing documentary film on the ground and its famous springes, including the Ketchma family Heinz, along with Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also voiced in "Kings of Calltown" (2014), arguing that he would certainly be successful even if he lived in calltown.
He has not brought it to the king of hearts.
True, there is respect for family performance, but also tends to believe that Trump is "a little more than a big wall," Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname that surrounds the circle is "The Brulljeseed": the defenders, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the beneficiaries.
The Trump ’ s success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a log for gold in the US.
The real-estate consensus was the first landmark in New York.
But the grandparents ’ lives were not free of tragedy: their desire to return home indefinitely failed in the Bavarian state, which included the Pfalz.
He did not accept Trump because he was once dealt with without approval, had declared the Institute ’ s Director for the Ponzi History and Volk Round, Roland Paul, a film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigration."
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of descendants.
This had repeatedly spoken abruptly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border monthly to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as the poll is not as sympathetic," Hans-Joachin Bender says, a remote relative relative of Trump ("The Oma was a born Trump, the Opa was born Heinz.")
The winter in retirement is more likely to distance Americans, "he is always so vivid."
Does he believe that Trump will come once?
"I can not imagine this," says the 72-year-old.
"He never worried about Calltown."
Veronika Schramm, a retiree analyst, mentions, like some caste stads, that a offspring of Heinz ’ s family donated something to the church ’ s church, which is generally benign.
"I can not imagine this from Donald," says the 68-year-olds.
It ’ s better at failing to win the election, for “I don ’ t know this is good. ”
If those who stood in power in the US at the time of his grandfather had been as "he would never have come there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Wintle broker Sarah Bfriler.
And as president?
"My president is not," she says.
"The sadges will be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendel ’ s film, long interviewed by Trump, has seen 12,000 children, and interest in the US, too.
The super-Bavarian community, Ramsau, at Berchtesgades is Germany's first "mining".
In the hands of the Vice President of Germany ’ s Alpenennig, Ludwig Wuushnig, the 1800-one village of mining in the National Park of Berchtesgade was awarded soft-tourism on Wednesday.
Austria already has 20 "mining villages."
In neighboring country, the donation is responsible for issuing the award.
A "mining village" must have at most 2,500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be a protective area.
Seven ’ s Sunnis crisis dominates ratings, despite Nine ’ s attempts to take the loss of leadership in the show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report after the loss of liberals ’ leadership, but it has not made major shifts in the assessments for the present.
Nine ’ s early-stage show was broadcast by the headquarters when Malcolm Turnbull brought down Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunnis crisis with which moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage were in London as part of a pious series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara, and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the gap seemed to be irrelevant to Australian TV viewers, as Sunday ’ s crisis averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to 339,000.
What we saw was a slight increase in the Monday ’ s advice (317,000) and last day (283,000), but his number remained behind last Saturday (343,000).
Today, the gap with Sunnis has closed in recent months.
In August, it averaged 318,000, compared to the 3330,000 Sunnis crisis.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunnis ’ s crisis in September is 349,000 viewers on average.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morales more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are right, thanks to scrutiny!
The Banking of TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive device of 800 words with the former station star of Packed to the Rafter Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recently bridged father, choosing to settle with his two children on the coast of Neuseeland, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a heat soldio without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday's evening answered with a clear "yes."
Seven ’ s X-Factor remained strong, with 1.136 million viewers, and slightly rejected The Bloc (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17-9,30 a.m.) of the new Quiz-Show, moderated by Andrew O ’ Keefe, gave 446,000 viewers on average.
The second half hour (17: 30 a.m., 18: 00) came to 623,000 viewers – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot (613,000).
The first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers on Monday, and 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The decline in quotas for the second evening of The Chase Australia will be a confident case that the Hot Sea will eventually prevail at 17: 30 a.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million minute that failed to outperform McGuires.
Initially, as a ``Sunnis crisis,'' the
The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man -- but who will he vote?
Intelligence reveals?..............
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may not have any intention of winning The Bachelor.
The woman, with Sam Wood finally reaching in The Bachelor, was filled in great secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give prize whether it is the one that the last Red received.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Yavons-Fellows the day before they become three, you may have accidentally indicated who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly to the final on the Donbas Day
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, naming his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitudes as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should receive the last Red?" your answers could become the spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood, except himself.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day to the day.
"From the moment I went to the house and (Sarah ’ s) and Sam ’ s energy noted, because I felt that they were rather compatible, and I thought it throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is with both feet on earth; it makes so much fun to be connected with her," he added Markoski.
I watched them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple.
In her view, Mackay said that last week's visit to the house made her clear that Wood "could be one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and the family, I noticed that this is obviously not just a game -- I am now untenable," she said.
And when asked who should vote for Wood, if not her, it was puzzling.
"I don't know whether I can say it," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a dispute between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday, 19: 30 a.m., on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFC career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US - and there were many other teams who, after his impressive open training day at the end of last year, sent calls.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne from the bank for the rest of the game by losing a shortfall in the way that the Exsile Rugby Liga convertisement did in its first Punt Return on the service day in 203 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next chance to a Punt Return, and also to the ongoing game after violating Bush.
Tomsula continued to highlight its true face in the clothing cabinet after the game.
Instead of putting his rookies through the cool before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
In his press conference, Hayne, too, strengthened the game in Tomsula.
The 49th sporting reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Teamers Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patented propensity and address the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patterns in a Punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the Games
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian affirmation had hoped for his NFLA decree.
Hayne flew the playing field after the flip, and later told Australia ’ s Radio Duo Hamish & Andy to 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFLA career.
"This was a thing that is now taking place, you worry about the next game, and," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the stir to his originator, Debüt, in 2007, when a passport in his own Gal area led to a giant for Quez.
Overall, it was a tame experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne positioned for a photograph with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game, praising it on its headquarters.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are gathering to discuss rights of gays

After challenging President Vladimir Putin openly, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company seized Yukos, and his democratic efforts were undercut.
Free voters demand the presence of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of high numbers of refugees.
As Lbert Aivger, the head of the Party and Fractioners, warned of a severe crisis in Bayerns schools at the start of the FW clause in large town, when new teachers do not exist, "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse," Aivger said.
"Otherwise, we will get dislocations in the Bavarian education system."
The Free Voters ’ countryside faction tories until Friday in the underground local community.
In fact, there were very different main issues.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Election Meeting.
"Of course, asylum will overload the clause," Aivger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavia wars of the 1990's.
"This is no longer the case," said the Free Electoral Chairman.
Supported asylum-seekers want to postpone free voters as quickly as possible.
As a result, Aiwanger demanded more officials for the administrative courts responsible for asylum charges: "We also need at least 50 new asylum-seekers," Aivger said.
The FWC leader criticized that several states were not consistent: "We needed a federal standard of the state."
"Bavaria shoots; others don't."
"We must do more."
But national politics is not supposed to fall under the table in big walltown.
A year of steam burning remains on the agenda: educational policy.
In the new year of schooling, cult-minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) launched a pilot attempt at 47 Gymnasia, "medium-level plus" in which an extension of gymnasial medieval status is being tested from three years to four years – a result that will take nine years to an end.
But this is not far enough for Aiwanger.
"The topic of G9 must be accelerated," the FWN leader said.
We call for freedom of choice for all of the Gymnasia that it wants.
Free travel in the G9 wherever it is wanted.

4 people die after police shoots in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in the southern Nepal, after the police shot brigades into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, a public official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in Rupandehi ’ s District District, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said that more than 1,000 protestors had rallied outside a police station, with stones and fire bombs from some of them.
Mr Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas, then shot into the air before they went back to rubble.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the cronies used, known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, appear to have produced such high death rates.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal ’ s southern level, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in the Western Nepal of the Tharus ethnic group that wanted their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have become violent battles since 10.
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to partition the country into provinces – an important step toward a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been central for hundreds of years.
The work of a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the Kathmandu Constitution, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
The City ’ s Planned Settlements
The basic piece of embodiment at the Old Post youth center is to be rebuilt.
The city is preparing everything for marketing the 4000-square area.
There is not yet a combination of trade, trade, and housing.
Emdes – Emdes want to marketplace a town of 4,000 square meters large land in a direct neighborhood to the Old Post ’ s youth center.
The preparations are now underway.
The plan is to use the endowments for a mixture of trade, trade, and housing.
They are waiting for adequate supplies, it is said, from the city.
Which investor would question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no treaties have been signed.
The city of Emden had bought some of the basket on the Ringroads/Egma Great Street a few months ago, leaving the buildings on which it was built.
Hieve: Details on the table
The maritime construction plans at the small sea take shape.
The investor first issued public plans for the project.
Many providers remain disturbed -- they fear the sale of their leisure mercy.
Monatelang had been negotiated, mooted, debated, and recorded behind closed doors.
Now plans for a new vacation settlement in the small sea are close to appearances on the table.
The Interester, the medium-size embodiment of the company "Systemic Building," first and foremost, presented his plans on the Council's Association Committee on Monday.
Initially, this was the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP faction, which accused investors and administrators of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the Systemic Building Administration ran into the offensive: "We don't yet have any answer," he said to Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to deal with all rumors now.
The €10-12 million plan has been under discussion for months.
Hard reactions by maritime owners who had come to the meeting produced images and new details of desired hotels.
Roberto Schulz, a methane owner and a CEO in the advocacy of the owners, Pro Hieve, laments: "This is a giant clothes that surprise all other construction."
Moreover, like some other project critics, he fears that the plant ’ s intended size would greatly increase traffic: "Since all of the bus is needed to make this happen," he says
But what is happening on the very one hectare of the former hosts is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must first have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because it lacked, construction plans are also variable.
Twin Mirage at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurter Zoo is happy with his Gorillas ’ s offspring.
Dian, a 26-year-old, has brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is back almost 50 years, and was in Frankfurt in 1967, so it is Zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla-twins is not yet fixed, because Dian ’ s mother has so far kept them close to the body.
First, the "picture" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for the Cyprus south of the Kapper Islands
The US National Hurricane Hurricane Center predicted a broad low profile system of about 350 miles (560 kilometers) south of the south of the southeastern Kapverian islands, which has a 60% chance to become a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low printing system, for example, in the middle between the Kapverian islands and the small antibodies has a 60-percentage-point potential to form a tropical hurricane in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google is launching a double-donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL) announced a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations by fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to announcing the donor call on its blog.
Instead of making an executive announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our trip included many dark railways and buses, just as hunger, thirst, cold, and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But, as Europe ’ s refugee and migrant crisis has grown, many people, like my family, are desperately looking for help.
Donations go to four nonprofit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations were doubled to $11 million, from 5.5 million to google.com.
Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Left loss of weight can help to slightly overweight diabetics.
The advantages of weight loss for slightly overweight people with a type of 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly over-important people with diabetes after weight loss live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgeon that wrote a editorial to the new JAMA Surgery.
Macross-the-board surgery or attorney surgery use various methods to reduce the size of the story.
They reduce hunger and limit their own physical ability to absorb food.
Over the years, ad positas have been effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly obese with a Body Mass-Mass-index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, some of the weight of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI are more than 30 obese.
You can calculate your BMI: 1. usa.gov/10ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan ’ s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected since 2007 in a study, comparing two types of adipositas-surgery, magnetic bypass and generic screening, to medical treatment for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent the operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained roughly the same among those who received non-surgical diabeta treatment in 29.
Among those who engaged in surgery, 36% dissolved the diabetes disease completely and partly, compared to 28%.
In the medical and treated group, diabetes completely dissolved only 1%, and partly at only about 2%.
Moreover, the results were better in monitoring blood pressure, triglyceride, and the "bad" LDL-Cholera "generally in the" surgical group, "the authors found out.
Researchers also monitored the patient blood mirror of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, and researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c fell from around 9% to around 6%.
But the medical therapy group remained stable, at about 8%.
But this better "glo cable control" -- reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level -- did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass-Chirurgie Group had lost weight compared to the host records (18.7 kilograms), achieved major declines in the BMI (7.1% versus 5.1%) and hemoglobin A16,1% (3.1% v. 2.1%), and more than a complete survey of diabetes (46.9%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of the surgeon after five years, there are indications from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life, Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
The Swedish study found it less likely to die over 15 years from obese people subjected to an Adipositas operation, compared to a group that sought more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit in the surgeon patient ’ s survival, Blackstone said that it is reassuring to people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the trial.
"This is the critical point of the study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long for us to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they collected these genetic changes, which have linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult. "

It is a topic that is gaining greater attention in the library: a young woman, unpopular and unassailable at a time of school, is repaying the black of her youth after years, and loving in them.
As is true in the recent novel "We are not so" of Luisa Binder.
Beyond love history, the novel is likely to be interesting, especially to Hunbridge readers, for he is playing in long-term and surrounding communities.
The chief professional author has grown up in the long run, pleasing that she could put a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - to RT News
Europe could not absorb all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries ’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech to the opening up the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which addresses ethics studies.
He demanded that the interests of humanity be put in place under the circumstances of circumstances, before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also emphasized that, while Western European countries ’ response to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria ’ s efforts to manage the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
"To address several thousand refugees, we are wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and real development, mainly through education for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Ultimately, we must consider how to reduce their lives.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence, commenting on George Bush ’ s actions after the September 11 th terrorist attack, showing that the violent US response entailed a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11 th, I spoke my pleasure in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the path to solving this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has produced unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four Children ’ s Drug Controduction Survey
Giving toxic control centers in the US report a nearly 400-percentage-point increase in the number of children under 12 years of severe alcohol treatment, Georgia Poison Center reports.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of hand-infection in children under 12 years of age of age of age, from 3,266 to 16.17 in 2014, increased.
"Children come to these products more frequently, and, unfortunately, one percentage of them goes to the emergency room," Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectant, while some do so to impress their friends, or because of a mockery of social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectant drugs drink only because of cheap experience.
Youth have supposedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol water to get harsher drinking.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive deserts of disinfection.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand-off disinfectant) are those that are paralyzed.
There are disinfectant drugs with earthquake, wine, and oranges duts that are very appropriate to children.
Trading infections contain alcohol somewhere between 45 and 95%.
Few prizes, particularly among young children, can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the poison center at the University of Kansas University, the station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let you sit around a sluggish whisky, but people leave this phone disinfectant within the reach of children, and when children come to it, it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently received four prizes of post-earthquake trafficking infection in school, was brought to the care of an emergency.
Their blood concentration was in 179, twice the threshold that was legal in an adult, Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated it outside the Atlantic at Gwinnett Medical Center.
Nhaijah slaughtered her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
They oversaw physicians in a separate childhood hospital on signs of brain trauma overnight, because the girl had fallen through alcohol and hit the head, Ritchey said.
"This was very frightening," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs's mother, said CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol products or disinfectant textbooks, and that trader infectious drugs beyond the child ’ s reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant drugs were associated with death.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario, women died after the stifling of traders ’ infections, which included a toxic, non-clarified ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methane, a lethal solution, rather than ethylalcohol, listed as an instrument.
In January, three students of the fourth classes in New York State planned to poison their "healthy" teachers by putting anti-bacterial products around the classroom, "a police report reported.
Teachers are highly allergic to traders ’ disinfectant devices and banned them from their room.
The police viewed the veiled plan as a "silver lining," noting disciplinary measures to the school agency.
Villin ’ s Things: Three Car Polludes
A 33-year-old car driver has been easily injured in a food-food car strike between Norway and Herders.
A 60-year-old trump driver went to industrial land on the brink of a circular traffic traffic travel, and was too late true that two leading vehicles had been in the traffic of the road.
As a result, he stepped into the check of a car with his truce car, switching on a ford feast.
The accidental vehicles created some €10 million in physical damage, and the police share.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready and had to be scrapped.
Celtic Disharmony
Grips ’ s talk of disharmony in Celtic Glasgov is diminishing; Deila admits that the hoops are in bad place, but that he will turn it even more.
Hearts will fight SFA for charges of enlson, and Warburton will be careful in January ’ s renewed commitments that could destroy the cadre ’ s unity
Don ’ s Stop Celtic Leadership
ADAM Roonee ’ s Elfmeter in the first half of the time gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in pittodrie, so that the Don creates a five-point gap between itself and Celtic.
Grips ’ s Disharmony Game
There are rumors about disharmony in Celtic Glasgov, spontaneously rejected by influenza, insisting that he and his team cameras are not under increased control, as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch tobacco leader.
I don ’ t think we feel under pressure; I think the players are pleasing for it.
Lack of Title Competition in Scotland ’ s Soccer Football Slowes Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers and former Dutch national players Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, because there is no Title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, now an ambassador to Ajax, said: "In Holland, they no longer show any celebration of the Celtic Games and why?"
It is because the Rangers are not there.
People here are talking about the Rangers ’ return.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams, and what they want.
There is plenty of tension in the Old-Business Games, and not just the people in Scotland who want to see the Games.
I will turn things around, provoking Deila.
RONY Deila accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian leader vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat of Malmãa and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, defeat of 10-man Aberdeen, now clearly at the top of the tables on five issues, followed.
But Deila said, "Celtic had a bad time before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out as fast as possible.
I know it is very frustrating, and a lot of people are very angry, very angry, or sad about what happens.
We feel this way - but we must continue.
We really need, truly, Celtic support, because it makes players better off.
It is now so important to stand together.
Warburton cautious in January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he was seeking some January transfer, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new admission, insisting that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox cadre ’ s unity.
As Brentford ’ s former leader said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players coming in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate, as you saw with our own group in that season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Michu ’ s Celtic Goal with Reference
Swansea stormer Michu, conversing with Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can leave when his treaty expires in Swans.

Grips ’ s Return of Avoiding Tynecastle
The inconvenient hibee was accused of admitting to have a lied with offensive texts about ex-Heart ’ s actor, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a random in Edinburn, Roseburn, ahead of a Edinburgh Derby in Tyastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the storm said, and added: "It is safe to say that I do not return to tynecessiastle if it does not play for Celtic Glasgov."
The Tannadice Board of Governance in Dundee United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but that decline must end in the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We will get the boys back to their shoes, "Donnly said.
McInnes happy "to win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his Aberdeen team desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive Liga victory that brought them to the top of the table, thanks to Adam Rooney ’ s Elfeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in political games or leagues that the Games of this kind have not won."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May until July, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland ’ s 5.9% unemployment rate exceeded that of the UKs of 5.5%, as the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of workers now falling at 2,612,000.
The unemployment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% over the Quartet - a figure above the 73.5% average of UKK.
As Scotland David Mundell, Scotland Secretary David Mundell, recently commented, saying, "The long-term plan of the government laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labor market, with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.

Why I will witness execution in Oklahoma
Sometime later, I will see how a man is killed, except in the aftermath of late legal intervention.
When it happens, and I hope that it will not happen, I will sit in a vivid galerie in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary if Richard Glossip is executed through the poisoning.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death.
The invitation came above its best friend for the first time in January, and, though I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear me.
So why should I?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
True, journalists can see executions in the US, and, with more applications often available than places, macables lottery is taking place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media centers from 12 to five.
Those selected will observe it without emotion.
I can not.
I will sit with Richard Glossp ’ s closest friend with which I have developed my own relationship with telephone calls and a two-and-a-half visit over the months.
I like the buck.
We often laugh much when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to witness a note book and a sample to see what I see.
I simply have to try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma blamed me for Twitter for abandoning my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Think of the story of the detainee as he wants, and you get access.
I complained about it.
She acknowledged that "it could have formulated better," but she still thinks that it is wrong what I know.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not, even if he did.
I have told him that he can get out of his list of witnesses at any moment.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a Hffington Post reporter, will sit alongside me.
If you want to know more about the case, consider the series of podcaste I have done.
I don ’ t want to reject all the details.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a favorite of the truth.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can not claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary.
A Man after Failure Police Chief to Leave the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man of Perth to impose the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and sudden water, but a few meters away from a police officer trying to "persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called a housetime breakup in Beckenham on the service day.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them to Canning River.
But he did not go too far.
"He was in the water - and said" I am not, comfortable and hot, "Senior Minister Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about his uniform, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "a good policeman."
"Sometimes people try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Master football players Ben Cousin offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins went to his car in the graves to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim about the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired natives to plan Ben Cousinson ’ s humorous biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards is trying to pick him out and threatens to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his sheds last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the Stewards and the Racing Victoria Integrity Department, claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai ’ s Late Scratch for rentageon, the last navy on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the race, and that he has found himself in difficult conditions when it comes to the positive Kobalt Tube test in Lidaris that he can not explain.
He had held back 18 months because of espionage charges, and did not want "to look like too high a dream."
"I preferred to say nothing, and I spent long on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
They know that it continued.
Sometimes you respond, and you must live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
Today, I will go home and slaughter.
I want to avoid the main reason, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
When they start to think I don ’ t, I should not be more coaches.
I have to consider what I do with my license.
Before that, Moody had dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had attempted to pirate his stone.
"Eighteen months ago, terror sat Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would name when asked, and offered him an employment in my sheds to provide information about what I am in my sheep," Moody said on Racing.com.
They apparently believe that I am a cheat.
When that happens, they should surely take care of their naws, because they failed in trying to capture me.
Robert Roulston, Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the RVL ’ s current CEO, was aware and still present.
Should this make me believe that it becomes personal?
Did the RVL behave solemnly, perhaps blaming people outside trainers for what happens in the industry?
Are I Bad for the industry?
Are I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps people outside think I am.
They may have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say now makes them think about it.
But I have come to the point where I don ’ t care, and that ’ s sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
Frustrations levels of the trainer ’ s level have been built with the long-lasting Kobalt investigation in Lidari, and the Late Scratting led him to say that he can "throw his license above the table."
Moody, best known by preparing the unbroken master Black Caviar, called the Rennago treatment regime "ridiculous" after a packing of mess or tone had been brought to the horse debates, violating the rules.
"It is against the rules of the renminbi.
I have to take full responsibility, "he said.
“One of my staff has mistakenly slaughtered on the ball.
It could have been yesterday.
It could have been yesterday that way.
But it did so on the race day.
Moody might face a three-month disqualification for treatment of the renminbi day, and an investigation of the matter has been opened.
It is a joke.
People who establish these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all recognize that we need rules, but we have gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested After Fahrenheit
The police arrested a man in Cobram on weekend after a clash with a ride driver and then ride flight to Cobram.
The radar driver was severely injured with the helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital after being hit by a car on Saturday Day on the Murray Valley Autobahn tomorrow.
The police said that the driver went on without stopping the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50 years old man from Nathalia was from the police in Shepparton.
He is likely to be indicted for bicycle flight and reduced aid, and for other traffic offenses.
The roadmap, a 40-year-old man of Cobram, remains in the hospital, in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm trainer Craig Bellamy is Returning against rivals for Ringfighting
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the checkling of his players "the agent of the NRL" by two Premier League Favors.
Sydney Rooster trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed the storm players "Ringbargain" with his team during his high storm victory in the qualifyming final in Sydney.
Brisbane Bronkos ’ s coach, Wayne Bennett, made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his team achieved the Final victory against North Quez Land Cowboys on Saturday, calling the game a “prime example ” of the Rugby League, saying that two of queens are not" good. "
Bellamy defended his team's favorite, saying that they are focused only on their "contact."
Bellamy added that criticism by two leading coaches on his team confidently voted for him, because it meant that they were concerned about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This always appears - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talked about rounding when they beaten us 24 to 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing of our defensive or engineering throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has happened to us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he evidently has a great team to train, so he is not accustomed to losing, so it was a little shock to him.
It is already comparable, as always happens at this year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "soccer soccer," reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won Prime Minister League with "slow" soccer in 2010.
Wayne speaks of soccer exciting.
He compared his game to us on Saturday, and how exciting her game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember that St George was criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said that he will take care of it.
But now he has a team that can and we see as exciting, particularly his young players at their speed.
This is the pittance game you want to play if you have this kind of gamble.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football ball – not every team has two players, such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, to play like it.
I build greater confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably did not think about us when the Big Games were concerned.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm Against Rooster was a higher result than the Broncos Game against Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game; I have not yet seen it, but what was the result?
Our game was 20: 18; there were two other attempts at our game; but is that an exciting game?
Or are recess and no points of excitement?
For me, it is the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet for them at a time.
The Storm-team is free this weekend, because it won the right, either North Quez Country Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday in the AMI, and the ticket sale starts to begin tomorrow.
Serbians with $200,000 Caution for Drug Purpose
A man who might face life-long punishment for trying to acquire 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to queens was released against a $200,000 cow.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kilograms of the drug on Y8 Solay, which South America had received from Vanuatu and made in Coomera in August.
Macrosimovic was observed as he met his colleagues in the Jachthafen over the course of the investigation, and later in Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the macro movic lawyer argued that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount, and that a harmless reason may have been in the Café.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, worried about the threat of flux in macro-movic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the Court of Wednesday.
In the penalty case, he was offending the police over his residence site.
Macromovic ’ s mother and bookstore operators had offered a $200,000 code of security to get his release.
"After reading the iron declarations of the two people, it is clear that making a safe $200,000 is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Macrosmovic was released against coaution, under conditions of abandoning his Australian and Serbian passport, reporting daily with the police, and abiding by a 18: 00-06 plot.
Accident at A5 in Che: Leading Houses Divide
A trumpy driver was severely injured in the service service service, when a three-trucked trump car in the highway 5 was fired.
Two of the three trucks involved had shut down from a steam construction site to Basel.
The third driver noted it too late, and tried vain to go to the left at the last moment, as the police told.
The leadership house of the accident cause was entirely divided.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsrub north was completely imprisoned for six hours and 2 a.m.
A €12,000 damage was done.
Stevan Hogg used girls ’ phone to lure pests to fill images
A pest operator used the telephone of a 111-year-old girl to call for images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl ’ s telephone when he was doing it, lurking himself into an online measurement service that gave him a series of unhealthy images of children sent by another users.
The girl later boasted, discovering that the telephone lacked and found it in the hands of the slaughter court.
She saw it, found the confusing news, and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "Web computers" that used terms to seek unstable images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pests on the Internet," and then "he said he was a policeman to scare it."
As the prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court, "he said it is an addiction -- that he is addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were conducted on the computer, but said that it happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare pests.
He was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent the images and asked him to send more photos.
He said that he did it to attract it.
He said that he is sick in his head when he drinks, saying that he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found news on the telephone, she called her mother and was on the smoke and on the wall.
She also saw the careless images on the telephone, confronting the defendants with it.
The girl was interviewed, saying that the accused used used computers and playsterization to speak to girls who looked far younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, blamed himself guilty in the sense of the indictment of having unconstant images of children on June 14 last year of last year, did not appear to have appeared to be an assault on the charges on March 24 this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual criminals, because one might argue that "no significant sexual element" is to be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed judgment until October to obtain background reports of social work.
Hogg was granted caution in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other occasions.
Before the judgment date, he was included in the award of sexual offenders.
Small Up to Small Frontiers to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken aside from the big control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many of the smugglers, fearful of discovery and detention, made people more aware of smaller border crossings.
On the Austrian side, a speaker of the German police said.
More than 1,000 refugees have been attacked since the end of the border since the day in Passau and Rottal-Inn districts.
They had taken root over bridges and doves on the German side.
They are recruited by German policemen and promoted to registration.
At the Munich Munich ’ s main forum, more refugees met in comparison with the weekend of Wednesday.
Some 700 people had arrived in the country ’ s capital alone, said a spokesman on the morning.
After reintroducing controls on the German-Austrian border, the city had reached 1759 refugees on the day of 1759.
Stuttgart: Tropics of "Henry" in Southwest
Meteorologists warn of dying in the southwest of Wednesday.
The German weather service (DWD) was sent to Stuttgart, through a deep print of Western Europe ’ s capital flows.
The sharp depth is the hallmark of the “Henry ” court, which in recent days has been drawn by the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic.
Hard storms and safeguards are expected, above all, in fires.
According to the DWD, there are 60-90 kilometers of birds on the Black Forest, on which the Slavic Alb, and on the ground.
So, on Friday, the sun can be seen again.
The mass is making: Every two years, the authors on the IAA show their news.
In 2015, the main movement has been in the Compact Car, which is now selling particularly well.
Complex cars are now particularly needed: roughly 28.1% of new admissions accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is reflected in the IAA (September 17 to 27).
Many new compact models are presented this year, particularly between all the futuristic concepts and new upper and luxury cars.
One of the biggest photographs for the German autumn is the Opel Astra, who will stand with traders in the fall.
"The astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel Chairman Karl-Thomas Neumann said.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
For the Volume model to be selling well, the new astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel promises an entry below the largest rival, VW Gulf, which starts at €17.
The current astra costs $1690.
Astra has a new 1.4 liter engine, with 74 kW/100 PS.
Moreover, hearing more diesel and gasoline engines rank from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, among them three cylin-gasolers.
Unlike the main competitors of the VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra initially exists as only five-stormer.
A second variant will follow in the spring of the Combi, which is also evident in the IAA.
And what, alongside the IAA aststra, will be brought to new compounds?
Renault Mégane – Renault has sent the fourth generation of his Astrav competitor Mégane into the race.
The Mégane is seen solely as a five-fold in a conventional, and one stressed, sporting, GT.
It comes in trade at the beginning of next year, but also as a combi.
Infiniti: The new segment is the infiniti Q30.
The Nissez offshoot wants the new model to find his position in the fast-growing segment.
Yet compatible infiniti, with its wounded lines, fits fully into the brand ’ s designals.
The basic model will be given a gasoline engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 CPS.
But there is also a diesel of 80 kW/109 PS, or 125 kW/170 kilograms/PS.
Suzuki Baleno – New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates his world presidents in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-Turbomotor and an 82 kW/111 achievement.
The maximum moment, after manufactures, is 170 Newtonmeters (name).
The sale start of the Baleno in Europe is the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but roundum renews the Compact Model DS 4, which must be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble cohort adviser put up mainly on the frontline game, where the cooler flu was recorded and the changing shivers were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior area, the intourist screening system was upgraded, the number of crops was reduced by a tourist screening, and Apple CarPlay first integrated.
In addition, a series of revision and new variants, such as the temporary Mercedes of the A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI, are on the IAA.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are worthy
The federal Constitutional Court has given a former detainee of the court ’ s record of complementary tegel, which was subject for months in a small cell.
Against human dignity, detainees are basically entitled to financial compensation when placed in too small cells.
This has ruled the federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday.
In fact, according to those affected, judges can hope for money even if they were locked in the overly narrow spaces (Az: 1 BvR 127/14).
This has succeeded an ex-detainee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsrup: he was subjected to a single cell of about five square meters of ground in June and November 2009; the toilette was somehow not separated.
Then, according to his lawyer, the man who is now on free foot again had been relegated to a larger cell.
His term in office because of the unworthwhile imprisonment of the country against Berlin failed.
But the Constitutional Court listened to the ruling of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination.
They see the human dignity of the man violated.
Chamber ’ s Decision on Pay
Even if only a few days of detention for compensation is crucial for legal reasons, it was said, for the time being, to pay for compensation.
Otherwise, "an affirmation of personality protection would be to fear."
The Chamber Court must now explain the size of the compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
For example, in April, they pledged a prisoner of damage only because he was locked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, human dignity is also the increase in a cell without separate death.
Karlshe also confirmed on Wednesday, and confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had confirmed a detainee in a case of parallels in November 2009.
At the time, the player was daily in a cell of 15-21 hours in the same kind as in the cartels cell case for three months.
The Berlin prisons had come to the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly included 23 hours, and aggressiveness is rising, even because of the tense situation.
After the judicial press office expires, 21 jobs in teeth are not occupied for lack of talent; 19 are due to drop out in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We Make the"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge; German Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is happening to Germany?
Some 8,000 asylum-seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Candidate Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to absorb one million refugees.
As German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say it again and again: we can do it, and we create it."
What matters for Germany is the following glimpse.
Households are needed for the next five years, according to different forecasts of the 35,000 (estimated by the State Department of Buildings) and 4,000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute).
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (2500,000 homes).
Dramatic is the lack of housing, but especially in affordable rent projects, with 600,000-800,000 social housing from midstream livelihoods, and these particularly favorable homes.
So Chancellor Barbara Hendrick (SPD) wants to double production, from €518 million to €1 billion.
Far too little, from the Pestel Institute ’ s point of view, this would have to be due to an annual rate of 800,000 social housing, which would require the federal investment of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and federal construction ministers are also required to have more tax advantages for investment in housing construction.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labor and Managing Research, 55% of those fleeing Germany can be workable in the long run.
But, in Germany, the refugees are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter, Claudia Walter, the project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
But it is crucial to integrate refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Labor is the key to social contact, value-added in the company of convenience, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says Dietrich Threnhardhardt.
In Germany, there has been a political turnaround, according to Threnhardt, from the prohibition on work to recognition.
While there was an earlier prohibition on asylum-seekers from up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, and the residency that limits asylum-seekers to a home.
Society has overwhelmingly prevailed, even because of the lack of expertise, the view that refugees should be allowed to enter the labor market sooner.
A major hurdle to access to the labor market is a lack of Germany ’ s expertise.
So far, there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most commonly mediated by personal contacts.
Building networks, therefore, is the royal route to labor integration.
The Berlin School Administration found that only a few fleeted parents give their children to the kita, an estimated 10-15%: "It is vitally important for the disenfranchised parents to hold the family together," Ilja Koschembar, Speaker for the young and family in the Senate administration.
Yet, in order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita, the administration distributes handsets in different languages.
If large numbers of refugees increase the need for travelers, the Senate would try to increase educational capacity by allowing more skilled schools.
In countries, students without Germany ’ s knowledge are prepared for classes of schooling.
But they are not always taught by educated teachers and teachers, as in Berlin, but also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a secondary speech.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Staff of the Berlin School Administration.
The German student network estimates that about 20% of the refugees in Germany want to be studied.
In principle, no federal country prohibits asylum-seekers or patients from studying; the only exception to Berlin has been to date, but the interior Senator Frank Hencle (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Student refugees could be facilitated by access to higher education.
For refugees with a permission to residence or tolerance can no longer get achievements under the asylum application law if they begin to study.
The latter, in principle, do not get a bad thing, because they do not fall below the circle of the people who are affirmed.
Patient refugees have had to live in Germany four years so far to be eligible for hesitation; from January 1, 2016, that range falls to 15 months.
But this funding gap, too, must be closed, with Steffen Krach, Berlin ’ s State Secretary for Science, and Germany ’ s student network.
Students should get baffled immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and, for many, religion is an important part of its identity.
The state should give Islam the same rights as churches, and the existing state church right to develop into a new state/religious relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic social-welfare association that is professionally concerned with the newcomers.
Right also belongs to obligations.
For example, Islam ’ s representatives must agree on clear partners and be willing to work with the state in many areas and give it some control.
This includes a willingness to oppose religious fundamentalism.
The head of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on the Donor Day that religious conflict could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to strike such conflicts in Germany immediately "have their right to at times, in Germany," he said in Bavaria.
He suggested putting the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more than it is now a matter of society.
In doing so, the majority society will also have to change, reducing discrimination and racism more urgently.
Germany has had an anti-discrimination authority and a General Equity Law for the past decade - a result of European decisions.
But it is very slow to learn, as the NSU killers showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunity for all: what migrant organizations and non-white Germans have long called for, and what international agreements like the anti-racial Convention on Germany commit to do, must become real in the years ahead if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens and citizens – for the sake of all.
Germany is generally able to medicine the refugees expected to be expected, according to medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"We create that," he said, the daily level of power and capacity.
But more money must be allocated to the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls to impose health cartels on all upstarts.
Provided services could be expected later to be reckoned with the state.
And, in the long run, it is highly questionable to remove so many people with the limited catalogue of performance that the asylum application law envisages.
Otherwise, physicians are particularly concerned with creating language barriers.
So far, the Berliners ’ health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are more likely to be resolved about their diseases than other patients.
It is not just in clinics, but also in medicine boxes that need to be taken on doldrums.
But many refugees would also have more universal medical records in the emergency bulbs.
And with another diagnostic perspective.
Among refugee children, for example, there are far more untreated disabilities, and the young are HIV education.
But, with the partially other forms of illness, German doctors would be aware of their education, meaning Montgomery.
"Parasite or tuberculosis are not so difficult to see." And, when it comes to shortages of medicine, the refugees may even consider it.
The Syrians would have an advanced education system; indeed, several refugees were physicians.
But, in order to practice, they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and perhaps review them again.
At least half of the refugees coming in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPTC): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugees are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, the president of the BPTC.
A recent TU Munich study shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatizing in Germany.
Those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called firebacks with respiratory, pigs, heart attacks, and death anxiety.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong vulnerability, and emotional thumb.
To prevent symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is needed, Munz declared.
But, so far, only four% of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum-seekers can provide a request for psychotherapy in the social services, processing often takes several months.
Moreover, social services would typically determine whether or not treatment is necessary, or physicians who are not trained for mental illness.
This often leads to misperceptions, says Munz.
Make a Storm of Things
With the new incarceration of "passion," the Circus Protrudes the traditions of the circus profession.
The aim is to draw every age group into the bane of fascinating acrobatics, animal resurances, and one-time entertainment.
Now the Circus Prosecutor invites dread in the maneuver on the ribbon - washing.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can not imagine me without living my circuses family," says Stephania Proside, Tibetan, and Juniorchefin.
"passion" - under this motto is the current maneuver.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family ’ s proxy.
So the gene for spirit is in the blood for the family.
"We are important to get people out of their daily power and to keep them in a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Juniorchefin emphasizes.
"Manegencocktail with world first-flair," Director Reinhard Proside calls his concept.
Fifty towns on the nearly 300,000 kilometers can now see this flair.
The circus ’ s agenda convinces talented artists from around the world.
Emerged at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, Russia ’ s Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm.
Castillo Brothers, too, understand their actions.
With the heroes of the tribe movies, it wants to take the Cuban Duo loosely.
They identify in these words easily and modestly.
Their humorous art on the woast is supposed to capture women ’ s hearts in the storm.
Apart from a large number of salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Progress also intrigues fingertia and charity.
Balancing with the invitation to a bullet?
For He Yuan, no problem.
Slumbers are both intriguing and frightening.
Wang Lin of China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and intrigued with their mobility.
Sixty employees from 12 nations offer diversity in all respects.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Progress, emphasizes.
Circumulative grievances are all too often the subject of different animal-welfare organizations.
As Stephania Proside puts it, "If our animals do not do well, we are not going well."
Roughly 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each unit of maturity.
The "fourth artists," as they are love to be called, are distracted from the eyes of any desire.
We want to cooperate with the animals and with them.
If the animal does not like it, nor does it want to be on the edge.
So the first imperative: do well for animals.
Specifically to her Zebroid, Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponyhengst and a Zelitia, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived in a lecture eight years, and nothing has happened.
"But, suddenly, our small jumbo was there," Brigitte propriety tells us.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the maneuver, but it is the unique mass code of Circus Proside.
So, for every visitor, something is likely to be there.
"One thing is certain," Stephania Proside says: "Whether five or 1 viewers, we always give our best and with a full sense of it."
The Circus Proside, on September 17-20, invites a 17-20 a.m.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 and 16 a.m.
Donors Day is a family day, and prices are moderated for the idea of 17 a.m.
Moreover, the tissue of 10-18 a.m. is daily open.
Zimbabwe ’ s Robert Mugabe Makes False Speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa ’ s oldest leader, fell from a podium earlier this year.
He remained inviolable, but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned of accommodating Mr Mugabe ’ s speech with jails.
Last month, they had blessed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union speech in Parliament – that is, the speech that he repeated on the service day.
Innocent Gonese, Speaker of the Democratic Change Movement for Democratic Change, said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS news on their phones, warning them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe ’ s speech.
"The news comes from a number not shown, but it has the title" death, "he said, according to Mugabe's speech.
She warns the affected members of parliament that once they leave parliament, immunity will end, and that their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "worried" about the dangers facing politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is likely to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company ’ s restructuring and austerity efforts on services.
HP will later be divided into two publicly listed societies this year, separating computer and printing business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and service activities.
The expected deleveraging causes more than $2.7 billion to come from the fourth quarter, says HP in a statement.
"These restructurings will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," Meg Whitman, HP Chairman, and Chief Executive said, to lead unity after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a broad and deepening portfolio of business that supports companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet our customers ’ changing needs around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on the provision of unmatched, integrated technology solutions to companies," a company says.
It divides a company founded in the 1930 ’ s by the graduates at Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto Garage called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The HP ’ s measure, the world ’ s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that closely focused companies are doing better.
FC Arsenal Chair Mikel Arteta says that teamers must be at risk of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the wounded Jack Willere
Less emphasized to Wilshere that it was only September, and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can not replay before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that wishes will surely miss at least the next four Games for England, and, given its history, its involvement in the European Union ’ s membership next summer is certainly uncertain.
The great disgrace of this current problem is that Wilshere had greatly ended the last season after a separate clause, and then returned to his old momentum during the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that did not heed well.
This is no bigger matter.
This was only an accident.
It was not related to his cronies or to the injuries that he had before.
This may be true in purely medical terms, but, no matter how little, there is the added danger of further injuries, even as a player tries to return in the midst of the season.
It is also developing an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd ’ s investigation has marked 23 different diseases of wildlife since his destiny six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal ’ s 157 lapses in the last five matches.
The broader picture for arsenal is that in six of the eight times since 2007-08, they have been one of the two prime ministers, League Clubs, who have seen most injuries.
Fewer accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes you have a susceptible period of time, a time when you must strengthen your body and gain combat power," he said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope that his body stabilizes; I am confident that he will, and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins his champion ’ s League season on on Wednesday against Dinamo Zagreb before the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and Wenger is entering a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Less can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud, instead of aftero Mono Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to balance the balance and beautiful the players who need to beautiful a small breefeat," said less.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to move forward by a group of R & amp; D, the macro stadium in Zagreb is among the most intimidating places in Europe.
Dynamo has also failed after 41 games, after the "intolerable" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shattered by an earthquake on the day of services, with the judges accounting for 3.2.
This year it was in Zagreb 10.
Few believe that Arsenal has drawn the lesson of last season with the Champions-League capitulation against Monaco, and remains driven by the distant hope of leading his management to his first triumph in Europe.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never complained.
We were very close to this in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
The Comedy Show that gives us serious lessons about Man-Friendship
The lack of similar narratives in Shows is evident, especially given how men ’ s need to open themselves has become even more desperate than ever, as suicide drates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main killer of men aged 20-45 in the UK, and three times more common than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably announced 2015 as the year of 2015 as the man ’ s year of asking the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to address this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficient percentage of friends with "healthy mood," its chances for gene escalation doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, one must have friends to make a friendship work.
In an age of communication, with its emphasis on substance on style, the answer ’ s immeasurability is often more important than significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lifelong, and successful, even if in fact isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values -- our internal yearning for personal development and friendship, which is far more profound for our mental health.
And, as a video inventor and billionaire recently pointed out, money can not really buy luck.
The beauty at Friends was that this focus was turned on its head.
Every character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which was smoothed by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent embrace, moments of soccer goats in fatigue snow, and the yearning for revenge from Ross to Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can draw on it, even if they often refuse to explore fully their feelings.
As a telephone worker told me, “My listener role for people who feel depressed and are self-defeating has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference. ”
The men who contacge us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old "I am right to do it" has an enormous effect, as the sense that it is perceived to be weak when talking openly about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that makes me feel when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly represents the small moments of men ’ s friendship.
However much my objective outsider status over the telephone may help people at moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
So, on this weekend Comedy Central Friendsest, when you visit your friends to a drink in the Central Perk, with the scenes they celebrate the day.
Or, better yet, if you see you sick in stars on your own, you listen to him a smile and say Hallo.
One never knows what difference your friendship might make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the outset - the entire 236 episodes - for Friendship Fest
Di Maria is Meeting to help PSG break down malnutrition
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his firefight against Malmomen.
Di Maria meets on the service day in his devolt in Champions ’ s League, and helps PSG move to Malmão.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani stayed the course when Paris Saint-Gervel launched his champions ’ s League Season with a highly comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmony in the Prince Parkstone Day.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his champion, League Debüt, as a PSGP player who put the French champion in the way, but then missed a series of occasions before reaching her lead before Cavani reached a headscarf in the 61 minute.
With Real Madrid and Donezk, even in the A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish championship, not just seeking the qualifications for the K. O. round-rounds, but improving the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But, while they got the points, it was not a classroom game by Laurent Blanc ’ s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic ’ s missed possibilities before the gates, and was later changed in the game against his home team and against the one that he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the champions of the League, so winning 2: 0 is a good start, causing our opponents problems, and relaxing, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, though I regret that we have not yet reached one or two other goals. "
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Parisi team, which, on weekend, was able to keep a 2: 2 undecided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but was broadcast in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine river storm was described as the man who could attend the next stage in Europe when Manchester United took over last month, and suggested why, when he went behind the malaria defense in Marco Verrattis, he left Johan Wiland in the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that the PSG would achieve a major victory, it was disappointed.
Malmán, who struck Celtic in a play room to achieve this stage, joined nine national players in the field in the Anpiff, with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle class.
But, apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who went far to Kevin Trapps Pfoster in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself sometimes stood up, with some misdeals and bad degrees, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts alone, was patented in the first half, and then abandoned after Cavani began to start.
Nonetheless, he demonstrated much more skill when he brought his competitors into play, and it was a passport by Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a script that was put forward by Wiland in the 52th minute at the pfoast...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the Stunden-Marke thanks to Cavani, which reached its sixth seasonal sector after Ibrahimovic fished a leftist flank of Maxwell.
This ended all of the thought that Malmstadt could return to play, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before replacement actor Eequziel Lavezzi was finally detected.
The trainer of Malmãa, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, “Our last December ’ s Champions League was.
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish League, which has not had the same level.
The qualifications game is not enough. "
Before Paris
It was a great game for them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through equity sales
Switzerland ’ s mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
The investor Glencore, registered in London, said in a statement that it sold some £1.6 billion worth of new stocks to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China ’ s economic downturn depresses demand and rampages markets.
The issuance of preferred rights brought Glencore ’ s stock price to the top of the London stock market in early Wednesday trading.
Equity ranged by 2.77%, to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore had announced last week ’ s $2.5 billion sale of stocks as part of the broader plan to raise about one-third of his $30 billion in debt.
The company sold the new stakes to 125 Pence ever, which meant a 2.4% rebate on the trajectory on the day.
There were 1.3 billion shares of up to 9.99% of the group.
Concern about long-term growth in China has cut iron prices by about half, with coal, copper, and other commodity prices falling by 20% to 40%.
Refugees Early in Weimar
On the service day, 49 people reach Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia, and Somalia.
The latest upcoming is a six-month girl from Syria.
Xi Jinping ’ s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US state at the end of this month, confirmed the White House in a declaration on the day of service.
The visit, Xi ’ s first official in Washington, took place on September 25, rejecting President Barack Obama ’ s trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
This evening, the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in a state coach, after the two leaders led bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional, and bilateral issues of interest, but it also adds to President Barack Obama and President Xi the possibility of constructively addressing issues of dissent."
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is likely to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before traveling to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a series of contentious issues, including Washington ’ s concerns about China ’ s supposed cyber espionage and growing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Leaving 4440-PS sports Car and Failing
A 29-year-older wanted to fulfill a dream and love a Ford Mustang.
The rampant highway then hit the evil awakening.
At a company in the countryside of Gotha, one can fulfill the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 PS.
So did a 29-year-old from the countryside of God.
At 71 in Arntown, the dream was then out and over.
The 29-year-older lost control of the sports car, went into denial on water, and took the lead.
The sports car suffered mortal damage, injured no one.
The damage is estimated to be 40,000 euros.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to the FC of Bayors in 2008
Xavi, the World and European Ambassador to Europe since the summer of 2015, has been playing for the al-Seven Sport Club in Qatar
The FC of Bavaria apparently stood close to its commitment a few years ago by Spain ’ s superstar Xavavi, who was then playing for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish championists, three times Pocalmeter victors, four times Champions League victors, two times world championists, two times World Club championships, two times world championships – Xavi ’ s cover list is breathtaking.
This summer, after 24 years of age, the FC Barcelona left 35-year-old, shifting to Qatar to al-Sander Club.
But, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now says that he was before the EM ’ s departure from Barcelona in 2008.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything," he tells us.
This also registered the FC.
Xavi: "There was an offer of Bavaria."
"Romanians wanted me."
As a reminder, in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FBayen.
Guardiola was why Xavi did not change
But change did not occur.
And the defining man of this is now working for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under treaty, and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I would not change that he can not imagine the team without me."
"He did it to me."
Those who know how Bavi ’ s 2008/2009 match would have gone to Xavi.
Xavi stood against the Bavi River at the quarterfinals of the Champions ’ s League over the entire distance from the race, smashed the Red (4: 0, 1: 1), and in the end celebrated the Royal Triumph.
Matt Damon Plays Diversity in the Movie Face
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity, saying that she is not needed behind the scenes.
During a sequence of Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown broke down when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonists in the project ’ s elected script.
"If we talk about diversity," you do it when you occupy the movie, not occupy the show, "guaranteed Damon.
Brown responded shocked, with offended disbelief, proclaiming "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when commentary comments by the actress The Martian became entrenched.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly Brothers to discuss the Show Finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about, whoever the director will be, how to treat the Harmony figure," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she is a rubber beaten by her white player.
Dear White People ’ s producer advocated the Finalist Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the movie ’ s rights; Damon replied that their governance "might end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded against disapproval of Damon ’ s comments.
Twitter users Mr Pooni expressed anger at the Clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity -- that is, SO WEISS that it does away."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 rebates and 4,000 likes since his publication.
Damon ’ s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After a white policeman killed Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement performed nationwide, urging legislators and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against color.
In February, the Sana Prince issued a gamble to the movement during the introduction of the nominated elderly of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums quietly matter," he said.
Like books and black life, old ones still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to the question of Elisabeth Hasselbeck ’ s Fox Newest Personality, whether the group should be seen as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers, and media outlets invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the narrative of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already hit the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior ’ s First Champion
Profit athletes and service support Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday, taking home the Great Price of $1 million.
The competition show that just completed its 7th season had never experienced a competitive participant that could complete all stages of its obstacle.
During the seasonal, two men, Caldiero, and Kameraman Geoff Boff managed to the final.
The last task was to include a 70-foot cladder in 30 seconds.
Stop the task in time, he was the first Athlet to complete the stringent 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero ended the challenge in full three seconds faster, making it a winner.
Caldiero talked to E. News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I think it is amazing to think about that I never earned or had been able to live more than $10,000," Isaac E said!
As suddenly as I can not even imagine how this is … the future is unknown.
Kent Weed, the senior producer, began with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final, and why, although he first stopped the Parcourt, moves do not receive any prize.
Under the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than a Finalist, it gets the fastest time," he said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and life changes, he receives great liberation.
I don ’ t believe that he has any resentment.
He is just as happy as he has done.
He received many of the records from fans.
He is such a brave candl and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
As Geoff told me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I am happy that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America ’ s Ninja Warrior was prolonged for an act of staffle, and the heroes will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers Needs Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLISI – The second half of the season was not particularly valid for the Detroit Tigers.
In the past, they were once one of the best teams in Baseball; now, the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers have been reduced to their role as smokers, but, on Tuesota Day, the party has been pernicious of the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted an opportunity to rise within a half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League of Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, if only for a evening, it was a return of the three letters of F-word that was so difficult to grasp across much of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit sparked three times in the first two intexts, then sixth and then downward.
Simon (13-9) suggested 6 times in the 1/3 inputs and allowed three.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end strongly this year," Simon said.
It is hard to throw any game in the bulltows, so I want to be very focused on the game.
President-elect Tiger heat Victor Martinez had three fights, and was in two RBIs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three heat game of naval life since he had four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He did well," said Ausmum.
He looked good at (catch-up), looked much better in the bull, and he brought it into play.
With three of us in the backdrop at the end of the victorious input, the Twins had their best chance to return to play.
Center Field Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left.
Right Field Aaron Hick reached a blessing, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeer before being replaced by the left-wing Blair Hardy.
Hardy overran the Wall, the only man he faced, before the president-elect, Rookie-like Miguel Sano, who escaped a twin run from the Drew Verhagen legal trader.
With a couple of buyers and the final flag in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Tream Treart Plouffe to a Double Play.
It was the 27 times in the Major League ’ s season that plot vessels beat a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurgent calm at the end of the Ninth Income, the Wall created a RBI double vacuum against the Tiger Bruce Rondon ’ s loose, reaching 5-4 level.
But Sano was in three pleas for his fifth shove.
Detroit benefited from a non-moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers achieved three rankings in the first two instructions against the judicial veteran, which had been removed from the injury list, after receiving more than one month for a feedback suffering.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more inhabited when I was selling and feeling that I would create some rather good pleas in third injunction."
After receiving the Leadoff Batter in the first place, Hushes abandoned a sine to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J. D. D. Martinez brought into play Victor Martinez into play a single "upshot the middle" in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez provided his 0-21 success with the wreckage in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Cack stellanos, following a sink on the right, got another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game by trying to reach the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers admitted in the second, acquired an Out Double by Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single of Center-Field Anthony Gose as 3-0.
"This was a big blow," Paul Molitor, Twinsk CEO Paul Molitor said.
He did not do very well, but he got the job right.
Hughes was in a Pitch Count, did not reach a third injunction before replacing him with A. J. Ater ’ s referee.
Hughes saw three of us in six Hits and a forest of four strikeouts.
ANMERKUNGEN – Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez escaped because of a violation of the root school.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrew, who operated the culprits of Sanchez in 2007.
Since mid-August, Sanchez, on the list of injuries, is said to be activated for the start of Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is slaughtered by the injury list to launch the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 in four pages with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has flirted since August 20 because of a right-wing mastery.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of Refugees Should Be in Vienna
One train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to heat.
His arrival was expected for the night of Wednesday.
The most maturing people should then be placed in emergencies in Vienna, as the city of Viesbaden told the service.
It expected refugees to be 450 to 750.
Several sports of the Dutch capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be provided temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other local governments.
In the last ten days alone, 7500 people have been in a shame, according to the government ’ s first collection of grants.
Frankfurt and Hanau, too, have created emergency housing in sports because of large numbers of refugees.
Germany ’ s Option in Syria
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, regards military action with German participation in Syria as a possibility.
"I believe that decisive considerations of military action can not be made without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective view."
Four years ago, it had been happy that the cure of military involvement in Germany has been declining.
"Now the conflict looms on our doorstep," he said in Germany.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees.
Austria Contains on Southern and Eastern Limits
After Germany, Austria has also reinstated controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leicker declared that no one is now sent back to Hungary at the service meeting in Austrian television channels.
Germany, too, has not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, it is so agreed," she declared.
When it comes to an agreement that would allow Germany to absorb a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikli Leiard said that there were already talks between the Director-General for Public Security and German Representatives.
Concrete numbers did not call them, pointing out talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come from Hungary ’ s so-called Balkan route to Austria.
Their goal is usually Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, called for a special summit with several other EU leaders next week.
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday.
EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
EU Interior ministers want to take another 120 million refugees on the next day of services (September 22) in a special meeting of a mandatory distribution of 120 million more refugees.
Given Germany ’ s strong refugee presence, the federal government wants to be more supportive of first-time and distributing.
The federal would manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced at the end of the service after nearly four-hour consultations with the prime minister in Berlin.
Merkel underscored the people who needed protection.
But those without a pencil perspective can not remain in Germany, either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The German Chancellor emphasized that the state as a whole must now be able to manage a "huge effort at force."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now on the Balkans route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers border with Serbia in the night of service Day.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it should also cancel the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighboring country, unlike Serbia, belongs to the EU.
Hungary ’ s foreign minister, Peter Szijarto, said the planned new border fence, is to prevent Schlepper from seeking Romania.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had averted the fence.
Meanwhile, in Turkey, according to eye reports, thousands more migrants moved to the Greek border.
Space song "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the iron tanks of the Enceladus Saturnmond, a global ocean is flooding.
This includes researchers from the observations of "cassini" spaces.
As a result, the moon slightly spills over the rolls on its way.
This category movement, though small but too big for a constant heaven, is said to be a member of Ithaca (US State of New York) of the day.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus."
For longer, it has been known that there must be water-water-borne under the iron celade of encelade.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered iron channels on the south of the Saturnmond's monthly monthly in 2006, sparking water and iron particles, thereby feeding the Saturn's so-called e-Ring.
At least in the south, there must be an underground sea, the astronomers then closed.
But the extension of the hidden ocean was not resolved.
Rama lacks 1860 Munich
The 1860 Munich must give up about one month on the offensive provider Valdet Rama.
An investigation has indicated a 27-year-old adroster violation of the population.
Rama had already complained about pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Löwen, diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of exposure."
"This makes us hard; Rama is a serious loss."
"Of course, we must think now," Sported Director Necat AyGün told the "picture" newspaper, watching the possible commitment of a unified professor.
But, as a training sest, the 1960's initially constituted a defensive.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was active in Belgium last, and once was under contract with the VFL Wolfsburg.
The Croat now has "the ability to prove its ability to prove itself."
Torjeger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brains shock.
Austria ’ s national actor is said to be on the trajectory as early as Donnerday.
Okotie had violated himself in a fierce clash in the Games of Fortuna Dübbef (0: 3).
But, contrary to initial fears, he remained without a serious blunder.
No Diet Fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and keen.
But those who want to pay attention to their smart line are often better off.
For Mangos has relatively much sugar - especially saccharose.
Common are the exotic fruits: B vitamins and the vitamins E and C., above all, Mangos contain much vitamin A and his predecessor, Beta Karotin.
Anyone eating the fruit thus supports sewage power, immune systems, and metabolic processes in the body.
In purchasing, Mangos should not be too soft or too firm, and should be pleasant.
The shrewd color alone does not tell us how mature the fruit is, so green mango can shine.
They should like to burn in magic temperatures and be consumed within days.
They are then, of course, flat or sweet.
But a mango also gives a special note to warm courts.
It ameliorates the slightly bitter taste of some tables, such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish, fodder, lamb, and will.
The US Pact ’ s UPS replaces up to 95,000 aid for the US Christmas business.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, including UPS on Tuesday.
Drivers, in particular, are searching.
UPS had already expanded its siege for the season of 95,000 aid last year.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making provisions for the past year to get for Christmas.
In 2013, delayed supplies had brought harsh criticism to the pact services.
First the Flemish Storm, Then Class Front
Next night, the calamity of the pleasure breaks through in the calamity of the pity, as MeteoSwim told on the service day.
On Wednesday, and on the night of Donor Day, the plea was partially stirring through the pity.
After pleas in the Donors ’ Day tomorrow, we cross a married cold front that brings powerful rainfall, wind floors, and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in one piece, Switzerland is now on the forefront of a large low profile over the British islands in a strong Southwest.
On the alspecter side of the day, the valleys collapse in the night.
As a result, the plea until Donor Day tomorrow would be concentrated in the flames of 60-100 kilometers (60-100 kilometers), and specifically in the Urnerland, with more than 100 kilometers/h.
The plebiscite can proceed to the next Mittelland, and even more than 120 kilometers/h are possible in the mountains.
Whereas summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees in the north on Wednesday ’ s wednesday flesh, the fidelity to the Alpenhang begins to shine.
Here, rains take hold to Donors.
Together, in the next 48 hours, the Alpen must be expected to be partially over 100 liters of rainfall per square meters, after major rainfall has already fallen in recent days.
In the Donor Summit tomorrow, the pity is running out of the air, and the result is a cold front, with strong, partially desirable rains from West to eastern to Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind is fresh to storm, and temperatures are falling sharply.
The following days are terrible at 15-20 degrees in the north, but in the south it becomes more sunny and warmer, up to 25 degrees on weekend.
Rome Now has Marine Luther-Square
Roughly 500 years after reform, there is now a Martin Luther-Square in Rome.
In the presence of city President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, an unprecedented place in the park on the Oppio hill Square was placed on the name of the German reformer.
In "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now credited as a "German theologist of reform."
The park is the same in the midst of the old Rome alongside the colosseum.
The face environment had been requested by the evangelical churches' working community in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, the arrer of the Evangelish-Luthian community in Rome, recalled that, for centuries, Protestants in the city of the pests could live their faith only in hidden.
Square symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) behaved in Rome as a young car monk around the annual turnaround of 1510/11.
He then viewed the city as a forbidden scapegoat.
His negative intrusions may have emboldened historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had since begun dividing the absentee Church with his phrase against abortion.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus, with the (golden) village crone, is one of the main stations that Otmar Alt has reported for his bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated bite.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with sham images.
At the start was the image of Otmar Alt, who, in 150 motives, articulated his fully personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and lone.
His "language" with color color colors and imaginative forms has preserved the 75-year-olds -- which is by no means synonymous with "final" images.
On the contrary, adjusting to the issues can be rather bleak.
Roughly three years, Otmar Alt worked on his bite project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many issues of the "book of all Books."
Cycles are emerging that address issues such as crossroads, suits, bidders, or fathers.
He has spontaneously fascinated several partners as well: this is true of Luther ’ s evasion with his theological orientation, as well as of the Kettler Empire, with his emphasis on art books.
And there, above all, is the writer Klaus Altepost, who has been dealing with the organizers on the basis of the malaria.
He has interpreted the bears chosen by Otmar Alt, thus "translating" into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirors of Alt ’ s nightmare.
They are embedded between Martin Luther ’ s original bibelly and an artist ’ s satellite, which formulates his very personal thoughts on the situation.
The smuggling block has golden rants.
For example, the 75-year-olds also permits a deep sight into their soul, its emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggered by the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, born and raised in Berlin in 1940, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Leader ’ s orders.
"Education has happened with the Rohrstock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to work this out, perhaps again with the master's father."
His second concern is to regain the value of art at a rapid rate of life: "The perception of images is now shaped by statements, and that is loud.
There is symbolism.
Artists have a different mood and desire to show things.
Images always have something secret and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants viewers to be "captured" in the images, to turn them on, to be discovered, and to feel what force they have: "The picture is searching for his counterpart."
Klaus Altepost stood on the service day in presenting the Otmar-Alt Bible ’ s Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" a favorite owner of Otmar Alt's art: "I may have lived with his images."
Old noted not to fully grasp the bible, but to him, the issues that are important to him, too.
"This was not a cooperative at the expense of the moment," Altepost says: "Here is the images that Text explains only"; it is a balance-sheet bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Failure, this is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alt ’ s pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and lone images - is first presented in an exhibition open to the Otmar-Alt Foundation on November 15.
BMX-Bahn construction Beginnings
Plans, find space, companies asked to model a roundtable exchange rate: almost everything was finished a year later, but before the BMP was opened, it had already concluded.
Political and administrative failures drove intrusions, especially among inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the trajectory.
So shelter is being postponed, new space is now seeking formal planning and application for construction approval.
Allowing it to be approved in October could now give the First Common Agency Sabine Mosebach-Bock to the Child and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year's visibility is still happening," she said.
It should then be started without "further memory pause" with work at the former dog.
DFB intensifies Immigrants
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019, with the federal League a clear sign on weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany, ensuring its help in addressing the problems that lie ahead.
"I believe this is our country's greatest challenge since reunification."
"There is no one in principle to say that this is not what I have nothing to do with it."
"Everyone interested in addressing this issue," DFB Chairman Wolfgang Niersach said.
At an annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee agreement in Germany intensively.
"I am next Wednesday in the chancellorship of the chancellor, Ozoğuz, and the Chancellor."
"There will certainly be a central role to the issue," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
Politics must, however, make the crucial ways.
Thus, the German football Bund expanded its "1: 0" refugee initiative by four years.
"We have made sure that this program will continue until 2019," Nierbach declared on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal religions also support this program.
Earlier this weekend, 36 profit clauses are a clear sign that, on the left's triple, they will carry "We help" - "refugee welcome" on the left rather than the usual sponsorship logo.
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," Leush's leader, Rudi, said of the "image" (services day) of the newspaper, calling it "self-evident."
"The refugee drama goes to everyone; no one can get away."
"We can, no, use our impunity, influence, and opportunity to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," Hertha CEO Michael Preetz said.
Hopen Managing Director Peter Retvel spoke of a "prominent sign of the League."
Women ’ s national team invites 100 refugees to Hall/Saale for the EEU ’ s qualification game against Hungary on this Friday.
Niersbach called support for refugees "a large polity of German football."
It is great that all 36 licenses had started their own projects in their places.
Equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active.
The message "1: 0 for a will" that we have spent is lived in soccer.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next, the association with the DFB selection and the federal government each provides €300 million to integrate refugees.
"The clubs have already made the entire sum of 2015," Niger bach reported.
Evidently, SAP ’ s Chief Executive loses an eye
The chief executive of Europe ’ s largest software company, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost the leftist eye by overthrowing earlier July.
In the accident at his brother's US house, he dropped to a water glas that he wedded on the left after midnight, the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He is almost unlucky, impotent, then slaughtered into the streets -- that he told us last week," quotes the "Wivo" SAP co-founder Hasso Platard.
McDermott can do his job.
"In early October, we meet before the Walldorf supervisory meeting," Platón said.
The 54 years old manager is "full of labor" at the meeting.
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Southern German newspaper" (Donbas) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I am full of SAP there, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the board and its chairman, Hasso Platard," McDermott said of the "SDGs."
McDermott usually flies between Germany and the US, but he has not been in Walldorf at Germany ’ s SAP headquarters since the summer.
It is important to go to the public with such a personal history, the manager of the "SDGs" said: "All of this can happen."
"It is important to reappear when you have fallen."
McLaren ’ s Magnussen, Out of Feast …
Magnussen tweeted a similar photo, declaring that he had suffered the injury when he was overthrown by the wheel.
So he is not questioned as a reserve driver for Singapore ’ s two stamble Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the Great Price of Japan a week later.
Football: BVB without Reus Against Krasnodar
At Borussia ’ s village, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus have finally crushed in the first European League.
National players will also lack the tablet of football federal League tobacco leader in Duell with the FK Krasnodar on the Thursnodar Day (19,00 U. S./Sky).
"We can not revert to him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the federal liver game against selling, the BVB coach made clear: "We expect a return to his training on Friday."
Given the high exposure of his profits, Tuchel will not change his tribal elf only in the reus position.
So he announced a change in the torture position.
So Roman Weidenfeller uses the place of stem keeper Roman office.
"He travels at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the World Cup champion.
Whether Christmas feller is used in all the European League Games in the future, however, Tuchel left.
He will most likely deny the second game.
"This is not so wrong with Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Roboterautos: Government Goes Lead Leadership for Germany
Germany is said to be the German government ’ s will to change the automobile of technological leaders.
On Wednesday, the federal government decided to issue a policy paper from the House of Transportation Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in building digital infrastructure.
Dobrint spoke of a "new mobility age" on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the brink of the IAA automobile.
Automated and interconnected driving will increase traffic security and make less work, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his G7 counterparts, including representatives of the IAA.
The Ministry of Transportation ’ s policy paper, among other things, emphasizes the importance of mobile broadband building and a rapid shift to digital heat.
A test of 9 in Bavaria on the highway is now being tried for new technology.
For drivers to "not impose additional liability risks," the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments."
Germany, for example, wants to work internationally to raise the permissible rate of speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers.
The federal government also wants to advocate a change in the Vienna agreement, which so far views only people as drivers.
As the automated riding drives, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver is becoming a passenger.
Technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in secondary swift.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated vehicles for highways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, inexperienced public-sector vehicles are "to be expected well after 2020."
Value-added for bicycle resistance and highly automated location drivers in Germany estimate the study ’ s value added to about $8.4 billion in 2025.
"The PKC's digital connectivity can lead to greater security and efficiency in road transportation," SPD transport politician Sören Bartol said.
But the question of liability in accidents and the safety of drivers ’ personal data must be clear.
But Germans still are skeptical about self-driving cars -- far more than the French or the Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday on the AA of the Review Academy found that only eight% of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next decade, 32% do not believe it at all in 20 years.
In France, 21% of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33% in the US.
Car drivers in Germany are still unwilling to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
After the Digital Association, only 7% would agree to give up control throughout the street.
In the highway, this could, after all, imagine 15% in fluid traffic, 45% in the stau.
Were every fourth left to the car in no circumstances.
Boll says that Tech and Double Start at Tianmen
The muddled village wants to be set in only the screeching of the front pages of September 25 to October 4.
The final decision is to be made on September 22.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The young have learned it by the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without timo," Bundestrainer Jörg Roftf said during the EEU curriculum in Desert.
Boll was on the curve at that point to a long-agreed donor in China.
The 34 years old German champion is expected to return to Friday.
"Without timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," declared by single European ambassador Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the slaughter in Yekaterinburg, also reminded the EM of 2013.
"Timo, too, has fled Timo, and we have become a European amendment."
"We should focus on it," the world's ranglist five-fifth declared.
Manchester United Nations ’ s English football player Luke Shaw has attracted a severe breach on the right.
At the PSV ’ s champion League game, the defender was hit and changed after long after treatment at a spin of a Moreno pockling of Héctor.
The first diagnosis indicated a shipping breakdown at the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Pigs.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant
It is a mixture of very large voices and a guard grandson cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich.
The bottom points: shatters, which, thanks to video projections, look terribly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French debator, which, among other things, became a major star of modescensory with Madonna ’ s beautiful routine – and with men in ruins.
"I can no longer say that I am the final fant of the dog Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past, it was futile; now it is true," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the "From The Sidewalk to The Catwalk," to watch in the art of hypocrisy fraud on September 18 th, it is lucky that the spokesman has changed his initial hostility to a look at his person.
In fact, he opposed it because "a little after death for me," he said.
When you die, you get into the museum.
The impressive collection had already stalled in the Canadian Montreal and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," Roger Dieder said.
There is no tolerance, acceptance, and vision of an open society.
The exhibitions provide a glimpse into the barely oversight work of the man who wrote modal history without ever having an education.
Chronologically, the shadow is not built, but it is a pretty choreographingly choreographed total customer, for which much was done: to freeze the crashes, for example, a triylist was involved.
According to the Curator Thierry-Maximum Maximum, 14 tons of material have been flooded to Munich.
Shortly before the launch of the October October Start, a special champion was still taking place: a living hose outfit with corn.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and in people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier ’ s old Teddy, too, is in the picture.
He stands for the first, meticulous mosque salary of the debacle.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad student in football), he had used his Teddy BHs and KUnfortunately, Gaultier said.
Playing with a buffer would not have allowed his parents to play.
He later brought himself to the thrall of fashion.
He stressed modal journals and looked at other designers ’ drafts, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, of course, I bought it.
He could not have paid the model for his first appearance.
They did not get anything, but they were allowed to keep the rubble.
Smuck, Not Gardine, as Mode Nanny
In the past, the long stick engine in and screens sought to make meat.
The stunted metabolism and hospitals were created in large numbers for customers, for example, who they processed in clothing and gardins.
Today, this alone can no longer work, explaining Andreas Reinhardt, the business leader of Modespitze Plause.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
Mode played a greater role in the early stages of the Plaughter's leadership, then replaced by the retail textile industry -- and is now rediscovered as niches.
Reinhart calls examples: top in smuggling, in Accessoires like pockets, and in regional breaches.
The so-called Vintague Mode, which opposes past nightpochs, formed a growing potential for contract.
Those in the textile industry in Germany are no longer in the market.
In us, they already account for half of all contracts.
Modespitze ’ s plot, along with nine other companies, is a member of the industry association of Plaughter ’ s top and nitrogen.
Only they can carry the protected lever.
Over the past 15 years, roughly 80% of sales have been broken away.
Private deals and big trade are almost no longer available.
Our products barely reach the customers.
The mass supply is now much cheaper made in Asia, and almost exclusively displaced by bets.
Moreover, exports, now to Russia, and to the US, are weakening.
So good reasons for new paths.
The industry association is also attempting to speak out of environmental consciousness, as Cordula farmers say of the Falkenstein stick: "We have a quality mix since this year, showing that we produce environmentally and socially tolerable."
Reinhart complements: "This also relies on the material used."
Diplomacy designer Ute Schmidt taught at the Ponzi outsider of the West Square University of Zdeveloping -- the faculty of Applied Art -- and is specialized on sticks and hospitals.
To counter Asian competition, high-quality and innovative products must be found.
This takes time and courage.
A tension arises between the most fresh ideas of the designers and the factories that need to think economically, "says Schmidt.
That is why existing design is often easily varied in order to maintain a source of art.
Several years ago, Texas designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowfall.
Yet the machine stifles small coastal sands in some places.
Bianca Hallebach-Kraud, a plurality of the Goldish-type championship, was inspired: "Before that I could not start with traditional blue heads."
Now it uses the snowfall to its smuggling.
In an expedient process, they shape the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of plurality - young and old," says Reuter.
It also comes to the US, Australia, and Finland, especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in plurality and environment, and who want to make a memory play.

Disney plans New Mary Poppins
Each is not to blame, but Disney nonetheless dares to embrace a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
According to "Entertainment Weekly," it is not about re-filtering, but about a kind of continuation that is playing with the magic child 20 years after the first movie.
The issue is the Nanny experience with the family of banking in times of the Great Depression in England.
Those who play Poppin more than 50 years after Julie Andrew are still unclear.
But the director is already clear: Rise Marshall, most recently with the "Into the Woods" in childo.
Xi ’ s Purge to Broaden the World ’ s Economy
The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth, says President Xi Jinping on the service day of a group charged with managing the reform.
"China should aim to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-ups," he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leading Group to deepen comprehensive reform.
Encouraging innovation and promoting reform will bring new momentum and vitality, and providing new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Leading Group has adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access, relaxation of border-control policies, promotion of private capital (SOE), and overhaul the residential reporting system.
According to the statute, a negative list will be established, identifying sectors and companies that are not in question for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative matters, because it has a greater role in allocating resources to the market, ensures a legal business environment, and makes the market more open.
The government will also ease controls on corporate powers, ensuring that companies decide how to run their business.
The statute also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
Under an offer to open state-controlled sectors, more areas are being opened to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," stated.
Moreover, foreigners find it easier to request permanent residence permits or the Green Card by optimizing requirements and facilitating the process of assessment.
Lawyers ’ right to guarantee their activities and employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
At the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli participated, as reported in a declaration published after the meeting.
Doubting the EU ’ s Quecksilver Line in Space
The European Commission wants to double the limits on mercury in large spacecraft fishing, thereby encouraging consumers to have a much higher dose of nerve toxic.
The European Consumer Organization Foodwatch, which is subject to a similar labor operation in the EU, sharply criticized plans: "The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full access to pregnant and small children," Matthidia Wolfshmidt declared by Foodwatch.
According to Wolfshmidt, the limit of nerve poisoning for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as hai or heavy fish for "economic reasons" is supposed to be raised by a two-milligrade mercury ever kilogram.
But large spacecraft is already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50% of the total can not be sold on the basis of the current limit.
Once border values doubled, only 14.5% would be prohibitive.
In exchange for this relaxation, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to exacerbate the boundaries of other fish, from now 0.5 million to 0.1 million mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this a "trick," because smaller cronies, such as carpes, are typically so low that they are already experiencing the planned peak.
Clearly, reducing clauses is "a perfect diversion maneuver that helps the economy by itself" declared Wolfhmidt.
Quesilver is a highly toxic metal for humans, which extends greatly across the food chain, particularly in spacecraft.
The German government warns that "already small quantities can cause particularly unborn damage to the nervous system."
The Ministry of Environmental Affairs explains that "health hazard for the general population" can not be expected.
Quesilver has come into the environment mainly through coal combustion.
Germany ’ s coal-fired power plants, according to a written arrival of the Federal Environment Department, account for more than six tons of mercury each year, two-thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in Elbe, Rhein, and Donau was "permanently overstretched and conspicuously," quoted the "mirror" from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU ’ s warning system.

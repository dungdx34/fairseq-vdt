India reportedly also hopes for a Treaty on Defense Cooperation between the two nations.
The Police of Karratha arrested 20 Years after Rapid Motorcycle Hagd
A motorcycle was seized after the driver walked it in a 70 kilometers/h zone and through buzones to escape the police in Bilbara.
Train policemen in Karratha today tried tomorrow to stop a blue motorcycle after watching it happen with 125 kilometers/h leaving a gas station on Bathdate Road.
The police report that the driver ignored half-signals and went on to burgess Road before fleeing to the Buddhist country, where officials lost sight of them.
Motorrad, as well as a person who described the driver, was later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulggarra.
The Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of not heeding a half-sign and ruthless bidders.
He is said to be appearing in the face of the Karratha Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Websters charged with hotel rape at Naim and Pitlochry
One man is on trial in two hotels because of the rape of women.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgov.
He is accused of raping a woman in Scotland ’ s hotel in Pitlochry on June 7, 2013.
The indictment is that Web masters attacked her while "unconscious," and could not signal her consent. "
Moreover, the accusation of having raped a second woman in the Gulf Viev Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae used the negotiating room for the Supreme Court in Edinburgh for November 17.
Back to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to establish the organization of trade unions as civil rights.
"Just as trade unions die, so do middle-class jobs," Ellison said, a Democrat from Minnesota and Vice Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
So I proudly put forward the People ’ s Proud Law with John Lewis Civic Rights.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against organizing unions as in other forms of discrimination - thus stopping anti-union forces.
Adding national labor laws to create an opportunity for discrimination to organize a union representation to sue justice in a civil court - and to obtain damage or punishment - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other sponsors of their bill suggest is to back the link to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years -- in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries around the country -- Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and maintain labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom, and union law in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution aimed at ensuring that Hedki ’ s militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
They used language explicitly acknowledging that "the rights of workers to unite and to act in concerted negotiations and joint negotiations."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers must organize, and that their voice in the new nation should be raised, Germans added a clause that explicitly said: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve labor and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and profession or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to diminish it are zero and non-existent; targeted measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors guaranteed that "everyone has the right to form or join unions in harnessing its interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When it advised other countries how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to create a union - and that this union should then be protected in collective negotiations as an equal partner with businesses and government agencies.
Indeed, with those rights in America under attack, it is very wise to recall the American ideal, according to which working people must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement increased, not limited, the nation ’ s strength.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, labor miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History recalls, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of protections for civil rights as protection against discrimination against the creation of labor representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judges stop temporary legislation that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to shut down.
A US federal judge suspended the implementation on Sunday of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say would probably have closed down all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, adopted by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, was enacted in June and enacted on September 1, would force doctors who carried out abortions to obtain a patient ’ s license at a hospital of 30 miles within a radius for their practice.
But the judge ’ s decision means, for the time being, that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions while demanding such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work on the law as they seek to gain these rights," Germany's judges wrote John develles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing on the judge is set to bring about a more durable decision for the law.
Advocates of abortion welcomed the decision, which younged in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors gained so much time to obtain hospital rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana will escape a disproportionate law seeking to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had tried in the name of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit, and had requested instructions as well.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that enacted similar laws, with courts recently denouncing such measures in Alabama and Missississippi as unconstitutional.
key pillars of a Texas law that would have forced most of the remaining clinics to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocates of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that inadmissible rights of doctors demand unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-abortionists object that policies serve to protect women ’ s health, even though some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has a real patient, divided the center for reproductive rights.
If all other state doctors are forced to stop aborting, the doctor would no longer conduct the operation, fearing for his security, said the group.
In arguing against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions, while their applications to patients would still be penalized.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put online videotapes for her mother who died from ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural Australia, there is a greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer, and found that only 25% more than five years after diagnosis were still alive.
The research director Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghur Medical Research Institute has said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20% higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
CALEINE STUDIE: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
Researchers studied women ’ s health care for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, ovarian cancer, existing preconditions, and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
Survival rates were lowest for older women, and for those whose cancer had been further advanced at the diagnosis point.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk was 20% higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects that it was belated to diagnosis and lack access to the best treatments centers than might be the case.
"This disease is best treated by geynac oncologists," she said, mostly in larger cities. "
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distance, as a possible remedy she proposed strengthening the service of frozen doctors to enable specialists to provide women with more densely densely residential housing, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographic status, the study found poor long-term survival rates for women in eggs and underscored the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tto Riquer Cancer, is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of the gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Declining Household Houses
The decline, together with a widening decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could cause garment centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year when, as reported in the Financial Times, today ’ s young consumers go to HTA to reach the “security-age group for garden-products. ”
The report says that, on average, I spend 55% of what people spend on their gardens.
The rise in people who live in highly urbanized areas without gardening, the popular process of pushing past gardens to park, and the declining size of the garden are other factors threatening the industry, with an estimated £5 billion per year being implemented.
In London, where homeowners ’ share has fallen from 61% to 43% for more than 6 years, the smallest outlays for food output per household are reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rents or small gardens does not mean that people can not plant plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Guard Adviser for the RHS, said, "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with cattle, because they can pick up their crops if they can pull them around."
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the “golden age ” of the supply market, owing to rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 ’ s to the mid-1990 ’ s.
He also predicted a better market economy this year, owing to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri continues to take place in Pakistan.
In the capital, Islamabad, roughly 1,000 protesters have staged PTV ’ s state-owned TV station.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now sending back.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters have tried to win Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence.
Roughly a kilometer away, they settled with pieces and stones with security forces.
Police deployed tear gas.
The protesters called for Sharif ’ s resignation, but he rejects it.
Meanwhile, the country's army is urging a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using force."
After a session at Sunday's headquarters, the military said: "The army remains required to ensure the state's security."
The military has an important role to play in Pakistan, and has already come to power more frequently.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of having cheated in last May ’ s parliamentary election.
The protests were escalated on weekend, after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to penetrate Sharif ’ s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey Imposes US Diplomats for espionage Reports
The Turkish Foreign Office has issued the country ’ s oldest US diplomats to announce a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Vice premier Bülent said that on Monday, the businessman of the US embassy and Turkish officials spoke.
The German magazine The Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that Edward Snowden, a former US National Security Agency analyst, showed that Turkey was a major area of action for US and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the report ’ s importance, saying that all the major countries spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany ’ s principal secret service was also targeted by Ankara, provided a much sharper response from the Turkish government.
Warning: Locers Threat the Consequences
The country-wide warnings by local local leaders on the Monday end could also affect the movement of people at NRW.
The EaP, announced for 18-21, offers all traffic companies, including wind, regional, and S-railway traffic, respectively.
The main source of the warfare is movement of goods.

As the German Locomotive Leader (GDL) union director Sven Schmitte said in Dam.
We expect significant defaults.
Regional focus is not on it.
The main source of the warning campaign is movement of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimize the impact.
But the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it is difficult to foresee the consequences precisely.
The Police Chief of Magaluf on Corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence on Friday of the office of the Mallorca prosecutor for blackmail by police and employees in Calvià, the city.
The head of Calvià police at Mallorca ’ s Feriensel, was arrested on corruption charges from businessmen and barracks in the notorious Bind-Drinking hotspot Magaluf.
The main commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, has been jailed after charges of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs lie in Magaluf.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by the public prosecutor ’ s office on the Friday of the Police and Workers of Calvià City.
Two other local police have been arrested by Spain ’ s Guardia Civil in connection with charges of corruption, and a judge has been asked together with Navarro.
The ABC national newspaper reported that angry nightclubs said that the authorities ’ cronyism had a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer a matter of money, of survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let our livelihoods get out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer, owing to a viral YouTube video that showed an 18-year-old British tourist who went to 24 men during a season of Fellatio.
Self-authorities have since tried to stop the unlawful behavior of alcoholized holidays in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol rooms.
Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentral Organizer Carnage must jointly pay a fine of €555,000 ($73,000).
The tourist place of Magaluf, who is most popular with young British hosts, is also well known for a number of alcohol accidents, including the trend of "Balconing," in which people walk from one balkon to another, or from a balkon to the hotelpool.
The first spring day of near and stormy weather conditions hampers flights from the Adelaide airport.
The FRUHLING has provided South Australia with an intermittent surprise, with fierce actors and strong wind hitting flights from the Airport of Adelayde.
At the evening of 21, another 5 meters of rainfall fell to the city, after 6.6 meters (62 meters) that had already happened on Sunday at night.
The latest precipitate was the outcome of a series of short, stormy spectators, including a committee that began just 20 p.m., bringing almost four minutes down.
Last week, after the winter delivered an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell back to just 15.8 ° C on Monday.
Evidence of weather probably led to the belated land of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.30 p.m., but was hit by a brake – a sudden change in wind speeds or shutdown over a short distances – and had to start.
Wind strikes reached about 50 kilometers/h on the ground on Adelayde Airport.
Airplanes showed that the plane had to also died in a second plane flight and then started at around 20.40 a.40.
Delaying the airline resulted in the late stages of some other rivers, including a Dubai emir flight and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, the Tuesday will predict a peak of 16 ° C, with possible actors.
Matthies Slurk
Given the galloping technological advances that threaten to turn our comfortable home into high-tech holiday centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comfort with a highly familiar electronic hearing.
As I write, I look at the spiral that links the words to the telephone, and think I think: Boah, how retro it is?
But this is a consideration: if the cable were not, all clerks would be ruthlessly in the house in short order, and that would be even more significant.
After all, is the ectronic (ectronic)?
No, tip blunders: electronic sector buys - and outlines the rule that the world ’ s newness today is tomorrow ’ s electric collapse.
And those who, for example, still have a residential radar television station that says only that it fundamentally rejects TV.
Why should these considerations be considered?
Because the Ifa campaign makes us aware again this week of our absolute incompetence on electronics issues.
The lady that used to dominate the washing machine and CD players today does not even understand the purpose of the devices used with unfathomable expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care, and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yes, do we go?
What should be said about people who appear to be volunteering such quarters?
In fact, for about 20 years or so, it has been mainly about smuggling our house.
In doing so, the Joghurt himself is considering to tell us, in the holiday, that it burns in the room.
And would it not be surprising if we were from the office of climate change to our arrival...
Yes, that requires a climate facility.
But a dream is certainly about to come true: we pull our watch on poverty, say "sows!" - and at home the dustbin drives away.
mistaken.
All of this amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "The lines between white and brown whites" wasted, an industry bogeyman mushrooms, you can link the washing machine to a headscarf, send the steam garner to weather report, and the data brilliance reveal how long the pizza in the bag still needs, but that does nothing good because we are on display.
We also know from daily practice: once a novel device is genuinely needed, the accu is not guaranteed.
What another reason is that the telephone circuit will survive the next function.
Israeli Children Return to their Schools after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday, having spent the summer in air pollution, while rockets and murderers fired on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and Gaza schools were closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The launch brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities loaded by missile launchers in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remain fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, workers of the "Pashosh" - Children's Guard, hit by a rocket that arrived before the students arrived from the walls and shale.
"We are somewhat afraid, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, an apartment in Kibbutz Saad, and English.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it feels "a little comic" to return to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we were not out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of border residents like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and avoid the fire of missiles and killers.
Many residents of Middle al Oz, a community near the border with Gaza that killed a four-year-old boy of a Palestinian village grant, are hesitant to hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not returned.
Their children have been taught for the time being in other schools.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city with Gaza that is severely marked by the Palestinian shootings.
He appealed to children to learn much, and said, "We will ensure that their knowledge is gathered and provided you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Day on an open-ended ceasefire.
The truce brought about an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas ’ s demand for lifting the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopening Gaza ’ s aerospace and seaports.
Israel calls for Hamas to disarm and the transfer of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this, and estimates that at least half of the grains are combatants, but did not provide concrete evidence of that information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and killer grants during the fighting against Israeli cities, most in the south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools rebuilt into temporary protections.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue to fight, last week's education authorities postponed the start of the school year.
“I hope the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn, like the children of the world and the Jewish children, ” Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza City.
After Choice in Scandinavia: CDU Vice Strobl challenges the Non-Prohibition Process
Given the NPD ’ s loss of votes in Scandinavia, CDU Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the current Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) process to the German Constitutional Court.
Berlin – According to the CDU Federal Republic Thomas Strobl, the ongoing supply procedure against the NPD should stop in the German Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the head of the CDU at Baden-Württemberg, the "People's Lady."
This is a good development in the right direction, and it is more likely to give me the result that the NPD is being fought politically, not in the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had barely failed on Sunday ’ s vote on the five-% threshold.
A first push to ban the far-right party from doing so in 2003 had failed because it had informants at the time, including at the NPD ’ s head.
In December 2013, the Governing Council arrived after long preparation for a new proposal in Carleslson.
Germany ’ s government and Bundestag did not join.
Taming for New Refugees
In the new-country square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central intake of refugees in Harburg is bursting from all the counts.
Now the Internal Authority has misled three tents of the Red Cross.
County politicians were only briefly informed - they are unenthusiastic.
"These skin fraud efforts continue to fuel citizen reservations, giving local leaders no way to participate constructively in the human shelter of refugees," says Britta Mr., the Green Assembly faction leader.
Her party calls for Harburg, the district administration, to provide unused houses for housing.
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents.
The reasons for overcrowding are the onslaught of aid workers - and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough places in subsequent facilities.
Many refugees thus remain longer than the regular three months.
Housing prices have experienced the strongest winter up in seven years, a widely observed index.
The RP Data Corelogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Houses in Australia ’ s capital rose 1.1% in August, according to RP data from Monday.
The total increase in June, July, and August is 4.2%, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9%, more than twice the 12-month rise from August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The RP data research director, Tim Lawless, said that Sydney and Melbourne pushed a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that house prices rose 16.1% last year in Sydney, but 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose at an average rate of five and six%.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued to say that, with the early-stage start, the next few months will see an increase in the stock of real estate that would bring the market to a "real test."
"When one looks at the persistently high rate of auctioning prices, a generally rapid sale rate, and persistently low interest rates, home prices are likely to continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he refuses to speak of the CEO Peer Medau, attacking "like a field hero."
The style of high school is not this, it is said, in school.
So Medau's family was "informed in mid-June of the university's request.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong, "he said.
At the same time, he points out that plans are not "conclusions, let alone decisions," but there are "preferences."
Likewise, the expansion of the narrow road to closure is less dramatic than the madrasas feared.
Of a nine-foot street, not speaking.
It is now 5.50 meters, which is more wide than it has been now, "says puppies.
The Medau-operators ’ argument that their own free and school-free spaces will be used only by students of high school, does not want to be cured.
It is not conceded at all, because, as with other public parking centers, this has become intelligent.
Thinking to the Citizens
The child criterion of Bergweitel, who is on the ground and whose doorstep would lead to a park deck, is said to be "not impaired" to the university president.
Instead, he has said, "not only that it is about child criterion, but also about intimidating residents to the Friedmans Square Road and the 800 students at neighboring real school.
So the stakes are far more than the vested interests of the masters Medau, "he said.
Whether the critique of child crystal's parents' poverty, with the expansion of the street, would be "one of the few naturalized spots of Coburgs," can decide "the reader himself."
In early October, nightmares, together with the National Bureau of Bamberg, want to inform urban dreams about the building of the university by 2020, "and in this context address the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau had informed parents of the children ’ s criterion about the plans of higher education last week.
As a result, the new parking deck will be driven not by the Campus and the Friedmanite Square Strait, but by the Medau-Berg.
This would require a two-kilometer extension of the pathetic road.
According to the madrasas calculations, traffic in the park of Schengen would increase ten-fold.
Talk of about 2,000 cars every day.
From the city ’ s side, they have so far not wanted to speak out.
Gland Returns from a Clacier National Clacility
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old Federal Religious SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited this decision mainly on health problems.
The decision did not make me easy; it has been leveled for several months.
It is time for me to listen to my body's signals and stop my career in the national team, "the 2007 World Cup told me on his Facebook side.
It is thus accompanied by a record of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because the much-publicized rebel player for the Flensburg Champions-League winner wants to go to Torejagd for several years to come, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrain Dagur Sigurdsson.
The Iceland, which announces its cadres on Tuesday for land games against Switzerland, launched a "long and good conversation."
His ideas and approaches have made me as enthusiastic as my longtime co-players and my successors will enthusiasm.
But, for my club, I want to be healthy in the next few years as well, which requires longer regenerational scapegoats that will not permit the current double burden.
The left had to fear its career after a finished infection in 2012.
He had treated Achilles ’ problems with a cortison-ssue injection caused by teaming doctors in the German Handball Association (DHB).
Emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the argument ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of profi and 11 years of national team careers do not pass on to a body without a vengeance.
I have some health buildings that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related football operations that took place in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right.
This brings some other disguised complaints.
As early as the year, I reported that while I manage my head but can not deceive my body, ” in the interview Glandorf declared the magazine "Handball Time."
He would be just in absolute emergency for a comeback.
"When all the ripples go, I am always ready to talk," the two family father told the journal.
But I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play football.
I also need to say that, after my long hospital in 2012, I have become pretty humble about my health.
After my career, I want to be able, at least somewhat, to walk.
Besides the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 gains from the Champions League, he gave the EHF Pokal (HSG Norhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the post-cold European apokal with Flesburg.
Shrinking the German Economy by 0.2% in the spring
The crises surrounding the globe have held back the German economy in the second quarter.
GDP fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 relative to the headquarters.
This divided the Federal Office with a preliminary calculation.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, as investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to a strong annual prelude, GDP growth averages 0.8% relative to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the “Munich Mooists, ” who first led the Sunday through the Burgmann town.
Horstmar, the Burgmanese city, was invaded on Sunday by a Dutch "fishing driver."
NTFU, the largest radar transport association in the Netherlands, ran the so-called "Municipal Mooists."
This is the largest radar quer near the Netherlands, the pastoralist paradise.
More than 1,000 participants were reported by Jos Huerne to organize the roundwork of the coin.
In various journals, the tour was offered.
We are coming from the heroes and staged overnight to participate in the round-coaster ride.
We want to know the coin country in this way, too, "the cyclists happily walk into the routes of circles, Borks, and Coesfeld.
After the announcement in the United Kingdom of the protective Brotherhood Sta.
Katharina was built on a small "peace ride" by the city over the Wall, where the launch was also underway.
Further, the road map, written for three different categories, went back to Horstmar Herrenholm over the Schöppinger Berg to Coesfeld and beyond Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On a stretch of 95 kilometers, with 1175 high meters, 120 kilometers high, and 145 kilometers with 1775 high meters, the radar drivers proved their good conditions.
They were then planted into havixbeck and imagery.
The chief organizer, Jos Huerne and Mayor Heinz Loufing, showed great pleasure in doing this radar egg.
We are happy, and it was a beautiful experience for all parties.
The organization went untroubled, and there were no negative incidents, "pulling Heinz Loufing a positive conclusion.
Unfortunately, not as many participants had hoped for themselves, as was probably due to poor weather forecasts and tomorrow ’ s rains.
"We're seeing ourselves again in 2015, with beautiful weather on August 30, or during another weekend," but the cyclists still promised to return to the coin, and the old are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker ’ s Unhonorable Memoirs
It is actually more philosophical than biological evidence, putting Konstantin Wecker, a professor, Pazifist, police activist, ex-prisoner "into 287 pages."
Not chronologically, but more thought laws for thought laws have written down the memoirs born on June 1, 1947, every chapter launched through a suitable Liedtext.
And it is ruthlessly honest: from online to high school to laden theft and drug use, it does not exhibit human weakness.
It is also true that he has learned how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
There is room for abstract but even more important terms: love, soul, ego, now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go, in a very philosophical way, but also very personal.
And he also explains his pacifism, social criticism, political commitment - and, as defined not only by music (the opera leader became a South and rock musician), but also his prison.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk who "comes from subtraction," as he says, "by removing everything necessary."
But there are also short anecdotes between all the most mental views, such as thugs in a GIs Lokal or a delusional car drift where he searched a tree head-on.
There, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me to the arms.
Never, “I love you. ”
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaian immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and her relationship was limited.
Henry tests a comedy, Rudy's Rare records that are partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of regigae and Rap, with vivid melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult movie moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother died, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know it.
You never saw your face, listened only to his voice: "Caught with the crackdown.
Let your sister go quietly.
Moving you!
I want to look cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who had grown up when I was a child, went into his knees, talking about things like the form of bierglastics or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had that conversation with him.
He was a great deal of my life, a serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a shootings in Dudley, and, though conditions are better than in his father ’ s time, he gained a glimpse at how life for him could have been.
It is now slightly brighter, but they are dark, interrupted, deeply stygian labyrinthe with flames and smoke and soot.
My father used to simply walk into the wall, and then was slow to hear him know how to sing, because he could wash the games.
When I walked there, it became clear to me that he had done so for years to get food on the table, and my respect for it expanded.
Yet Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ popularity.
My father never embraced me; he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother was bad at the end of her life that we began "I love you, I love you to love you."
His own daughter, Dawn French, allowed him to share the love he had missing as a child.
Can you quit the "I love you?"?
Let me be too poor!
Papa, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still happy with France, with which it was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry ’ s own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to their death.
So, when I became very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor "said you must be radical.
So I got away with this fitness and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is tough.
No one likes to eat carophets.
Henry ’ s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-lived barter.
Since praised by critics of his Othello, he has been captured by theater.
The comedy of error followed, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from that of the seats and comedy that have filled its business lives.
He began with only 16 years when he was working in a factory.
A DTY discovered it on the scene by imitating and writing to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970's. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for a rather long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to learn not only from the public ’ s eyes, but also from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke magazine, while I was a star on television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny at The New Faces in 1975
Because his manager possessed the five-year property right of Black and White Minstrelenl Show, a lightly entertained entertainment program in which people "wear themselves black," Henry listed his comedy there for more than five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I somehow wished that it would never have happened, but I don ’ t regret for having.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long low-cost light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters that both derided and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 1980 ’ s on an alternative comedy circle.
The first line of Lenny Henry Show went to the show in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as the head of the coast of Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie!
Advertisers, documentaries, telephones, and film roles coined his next decade, but, after his BCSA series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What will you do next, because it feels like it all it gives you time, or trickles a little in place."
Then came a documentary for Radio 4 entitled What ’ s So Great About...
The first consequence was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was virtually allergic.
I had never really learned something about him at school, presided over him largely in the domain of the middle class, whites in Structural Hoses, and a cabbage.
So I was very afraid.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Tream Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "Thou dream of trying it.
Make it not bad if you don ’ t whitewash, as you do.
Next to some of the words in the mouth, and then you understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry listened 20 lines of Othellos last speech for the documentary film, and he was enthusiastic.
I felt that I could do so.
It was almost as if someone had finally got me right.
"That is why," it is a serious thing, no seriously, do they sink your text, consult a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece of months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and that simply did not happen.
He soon stepped up in the comedy of error.
Suddenly, I was in the national theater, and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought "Oh, you will change you."
There was a technical flaw, and Henry felt instinctively that he had to keep the audience.
"A small voice," said to me, "must now bribe 10 minutes while repairing the computer."
Instead, the refrigerator announced that once the problem was resolved, the idea would continue.
I went from the scene, and something I said, "Oh Thank God."
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a piece of theater, so you remain in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, and it strengthens the sins.
This, too, was a good thing, so it is like a big sign of gods who tell me, "This is your provision."
He says, of course, with a DONNERNDA voice.
So I remain here.
I really love this.
I love being in a comfort area.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is riddled with humorous outbreaks, while imitating individuals.
I have decided not to make a standard comedy, because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction is somehow dangerous from a room full of strangers.
If you look for it, you will be afraid of a wall.
I sometimes live up to Apollo when I love it, but I have not as much overall.
I ask him whether he will ever again make a standard comedy.
The fun that I have in a room with a director to help shape a beginning, middle, and end a journey - I don't think I'm going to give up.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be a actor.
It ’ s fun.
History is always told, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthing Roads in Yemen ’ s capital
In the conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Huthian supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said one Speaker of the Houthi party, Ansar Allah.
The assembly process has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic jao in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Huthi leader Abdullah al-Huthi called for action on Sunday.
Huthi, according to the newspaper, threatened to escalate further if his demands were not met.
The Shia Huthis is fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen, and is calling for the government to resign.
The Huthi people have been besieged for almost two weeks in the Yemeni capital.
Some 30,000 rebels have erected protest camps on Sanaa ’ s great sea lanes.
Around the country, bloody fighting with the Yemeni army is occurring again and again.
Kenya is registering civil servants to curb "ghost employees."
Kenya has begun to register all public officials biometrically to annihilate "ghost workers" from government pay lists.
Workers who do not register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government office.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive compensation after their departure from the civil service.
When President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013, he promised to fight corruption in the civil service.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost to payments for "ghost employees" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts that have died or left public services, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from Nairobi, the capital.
All officials must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure that their data are included in the biometric registration, and have been told in a government ’ s news.
Everyone who did not do so without a credible apology would be slashed by the payroll list.
"This will go a long way toward rationalizing the civil service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and adjusting the payrolls at both levels of government -- the" ghost workers, "said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The art consultant Helge Achenbach scandal is first negotiated in court on November 11.
Five heirs to Berthold Albrecht, the son of the aldi-founder Theo Albreach, are demanding 19.4 million euros of damage from the damages of Achenbach and two of his companies in bankruptcy.
This divided a Monday courtroom.
In the bottlenecks, Achenbach has cheated art and mercenaries, and Berthold Albread has calculated higher than actually paid purchasing prices.
This has made the Provision more relevant.
Eight day, for €121 million, the value of old-age wages has been purchased.
Children Need Roots and Wings
44 years was in school service, 23 as schoolmasters.
From that time, Manfred Judges knows many established peers and collaborators of their time as students.
His methods have sometimes been unconventional, but always carried out by his desire to see the public in the student.
The snowfall is the most famous mountain of the giant mountain.
Manfred judges love the painting with the motive of his home.
Judge was born in Trautenau/North Heads in 1930, now Trutnov.
He was already interested in teachers ’ profession after four years of preschool.
One year after, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave.
After a few months in a camp, Bavaria entered 1946 - in the Güter fantasy.
So it took judges to the upper echelon.
Teachers ’ education took place in Bamberg.
To do so, Manfred judges had to walk to Bamberg six miles a week, walking to the railway to Bamberg, walking three kilometers away from the city as a whole.
After two months, Manfred judges received a sleep call in a Red Cross home in Bamberg, together with up to 15 colleagues in a bedroom.
In 1951, he made the first and the second state sex after three years of Lehman.
Since uprisings had no free teachers for him, he went to Colonel Bavaria and went to school in Collbach on November 1, 1954.
The "volunteer room" was his first "apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he attracted a three-room home in the re-built classroom home next to school.
That house bought Manfred Judge in 1980, after the 1968 Collbach School was dissolved.
Until then, in Collbach, there were three classes and five in Petershops in the School Association.
From the school year 1968/69, they were summarized in Petershops in today ’ s Rathouse.
When Indersdorf was founded, only primary schools remained in place.
To escape a downgrade in the now smaller school, Georg Sigl, then a woman, changed to Karsfeld and Manfred Judge.
But peer thumbs grew, enabling the children and their teachers to draw on today ’ s construction, which was broadened after judges ’ retirement in 1997.
Manfred judges praise the uncomplicated generosity of then-Mayor Ludwig Götz, who, on top of the community ’ s costs, added a lot of advertising and the extension of 1997, although this was not accessible according to the guidelines governing schools.
"Mayor Götz was highly debt-friendly," Judge thankfully recalled.
Throughout his career, Manfred Judge never forgot the resignation of a government official who had responded to a referendum on law and justice: "You must never forget love," and Manfred Judge surrounded what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give your children two things: roots and wings," he now says.
"Don't always succeed." Whether he means only his students, or just his own six children, is not entirely clear.
In any case, judges ’ actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat, they were not, say, a criminal record and were not concealed.
At the expense of the community, judges had created two Paar Boxhandbands, and allowed the two opponents to compete with each other, even if there were a pieces.
For the sake of the school, judges had a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
It led the nonpartisan judge after his retirement in 1996 to run on the CSU list for the Community Council at least.
But judges were nominated for sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in Three Days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers use interim freezing in the Kurds of Bad Salzhausen and Shots.
When Radler walks on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Shots, it is not, in itself, special.
But on Friday alone, the number of caste givers seemed: the 700 students of the hr4-Radtour and the Beside trough enjoyed a pause at the lower lower house of Bad Salzhausen, and then a party under free heaven in the shotgun Alteburgpark.
Under the slogan "Radlen and celebrate in newfound ways between Nidda and Children," the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Donbas Day, seeing a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, it became serious: the radar took the first hit, taking 60 kilometers across the Flemish town to Bad Salzhausen, and then to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, were greeted with the head of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Piing Döring.
To freeze the body and the mind, all had been prepared for good things: the countrymen of Rancity and Dutch mocktown had 85 blacks of apples, compulsory, streetch, and cage that miraculously studied the dious radar.
"Such pies can appease only countrymen," praises a participant in Aulspage, while robbing another pieces.
The tournament ’ s beacon, Geisn-Nidda, allowed cold openings to emerge.
The "Duo Bravo" kept visitors with known melodies from operations and musicals and promoted applause.
The beautiful ambition of the park was exciting.
Moreover, one man enjoyed a headscarf from his partner: "He deserved, after all, to rebuild already fractured bicycle chains."
Meanwhile, the mayor and CEO had to work, interviewed at the well of reporters Rainer Janke ’ s drinking house, and seized the opportunity to recruit bathhouses on radio.
Promotionist Tobias Hagen, too, has briefly shut down since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 as a tournament, but has had plenty to do with local engineering.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his staff and the 15-member motorcycle coffers of the police at home, wrote Facebook records, and made reporters, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhein-Main area," he told, "but also from guns or fulda, loudspeaker or tunus, and even from numerous cities in western fals.
Part of the total is built a bit after the overhaul capacity at its disposal.
In category I, participants are housed in hotels, in category II in gatherings.
From the Kurds, the rabbble-roadler looked good when they reemerged after a year and a half: "Czechs!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!"
After the arrival in Scots, the group allowed a short respite.
But on the evening, the pastoralists were called for in the idyllic Alteburgk.
Under the directions of the Scots Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful maintenance ambition, and of course, it had prepared liecks, such as flammals with well-cooled feeding whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hosfeld, and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed visitors in his role as CEO of the ADAC Hessen-Thürses.
The three were deliberately pleased with the "many operations in Scots."
The Task Force then released Tobias ’ s hair.
The opportunity for weak charges under free heaven was eagerly used, despite sports activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests, citizens as well as the great beaches of the cyclists became increasingly mingled.
The second day, the radar drivers saw the Birstein, Guardian, and Bad Orb stations - including a dividend account with the trench forests - on the agenda.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radelns, athletes entered Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish Policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government.
Overall 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey for the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," the local media outlets reported.
Police authorities did not issue an immediate comment.
Among the detainees, 14 high-ranking police officers are reported by Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly creating organized criminal association and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Gülen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not All children in Ukraine Return to School
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened up after summer holidays on Monday (1 September).
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
He told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful across Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
All of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People ’ s Front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, a school headmaster who visited Jazenjuk ’ s daughter, spoke to Russia.
We hope that, at long last, there is peace again, and that children will receive an education that will benefit them in life.
The New Year ’ s first schooling Day is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing decisive inhibitions, keeping balloons in the hands of balloons, and letting their teachers flock.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
It meets a proud dormant from the banking world, media management, and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own front-line experience.
Their career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which changed them to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearson.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years, and resigned when the parent company Pearson ’ s top job went to a younger male colleague.
Their plot was allegedly nearly £1 million.
Their political standing, too, is solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former head of the BP, when he looked for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former tale council member.
As early as May, I described the chairman ’ s task with a poisoned celet.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure as well.
Confidence works in two directions: inward to the first guard of the BBC ’ s managerial hierarchy, but also outward as a voice for public concern and unease when things go wrong.
This provides an almost untenable duopoly that demands comprehensive reform.
But what new anchormen would risk entering, beating up, and unraveling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps raising himself around his job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if it were not enough, many more want to see the BBC shrinking – power, money, and status – overtaken.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC carries special dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 per year, the British public is certainly buying itself into the world ’ s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96% of all households, costing only 40 Pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53% are now supporting it, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The maritime and utilization habits of the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my cell phone nowadays and see squandered programs later on my player.
But it remains a loved and respectable institution.
It needs a respectable chairman - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says that falling tweet was not authorized.
One tweet of Texas Republican governor Rick Perry ’ s official user on Sunday contained a comforting comment on the democratic county prosecutor, who is at the center of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry ’ s user accounts, which marked the previous one.
It is just a tweet that was sent from my account, not authorized by me.
"I don't endorse the tweet and deleted it," he said later.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perron ’ s nominally targeted user account ended, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former tweet, an unfavorable picture of the township lawyer of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was condemned for darkness in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding from her office when she refused to resign, leading to charges against Perry, who may be a presidential candidate in 2016, before a Grand Jury this month.
The tweet's text is that "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible level of alcohol … but when I do, I sult Governor Perry when he shines."
I am the most defiant democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg ’ s office was not concerned with managing the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCain, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry was not guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His cherished team of jurisdictions requested that judges be charged with dismissing the charges, arguing that the law against the most senior governor in the history of Texas is unveiled.
Perry blocked $7.5 million of government funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigated in cases of government corruption in Texas - as has refused to resign.
The veto produced a public complaint on the part of a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perron's official user account is often updated -- and sometimes famous.
After finishing as a fifth month at the Iowa Electoral Assembly during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry came to speculate that he would stop taking a tweet of photo photos at the Jog meeting near a lake, said, “South Carolina, We are coming! ”
Berkeley Revisited the Housing Market
One of London's most prominent construction entrepreneurs pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England has returned to normal levels.
Houses in the capital were hot and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to place limits on mortgage lending in June, owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
As Tony Pidgley, the founder and CEO of Berkeley, said on Monday, "Since the start of the financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013," and added that this has halved a "stable environment of action."
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Klieeramate, prices in the urban area rose 18.5% last year alone, far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sale prices at Berkeleys private, low-cost, and student offers up about one-fifth last year, and stood at the end of April by the £423,000.
But a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive in recent months to foreign buyers - some of them also discouraged from introducing new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "Vills Tax" in the general election next May.
The London real estate broker Foxton warned last week that the April mortgage market report, when more stringent lending was introduced, would lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real-estate agency, revised its forecast of a 3% rise in house prices in London for 2015, to the bottom of 3%, on the basis of an already weakening housing price spike.
The volume of transaction in the most expensive places of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter every year, according to the WA Ellis.
Yet the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the maturing amounts of futures sales amount to more than $2.2 billion.
As Mr. Pidgley added, "demand for the right, well-planned product remained stable in the best locations, and futures sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes by the end of April – nearly one-third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual tax outcomes rose by 40% annually, to £280 million, the turnover by 18%, to £1.6 billion.
In a monthly testimony to the company ’ s annual meeting, Herr Pidgley said that this year ’ s revenues for Berkeley were expected to correspond to today ’ s market expectations.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax outcome at $450 million.
Berkeleyy shares were fixed at £23.96 on the afternoon in London trade.
Naktfotos of Jennifer Lawrence by Internet hackers
The occurrence of Jennifer Lawrence at 85.
Nacktamptos by the Nobel laureate Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A "The Tribute of Panem" representative confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and indicted the hackers for "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who continue to place the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photographs that were originally postponed on the photo Sharing page of 4chan were allegedly obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud of Apple, which included the Hackingopfer's alleged "Master list" of women stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wane, and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not safe to see how many of the images are real, though Winning "Star from" Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world "also condemned the veil on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photographs that my husband and I took up in our house's private environment years ago - I hope you are so satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeonymous "iCarly" and "Victory" came to mind that the photos of her are pictures of her trading and website "are GEFLSCHT, people.
Let ’ s not even consider the beginning. * language game is intended.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that Speaker of Popular Star Ariana Grande echoed the ease of the purported photos from them.
Exclusive exit from Howard Jacobson's lofty new novel about love and letter "J."
They crumbled, the best described it, slowly disintegrated like a carton that was left to the rains.
Occasionally, a woman said he was too serious, rigorous, intense, distanced, and perhaps blatant.
And then he washed his hands.
He knew blatantly.
He was stubbornly, yes.
The last casualty of this obstinacy was a just beginning affair that had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was an infamous beauty with untold hair and a flattering heart from a village on the coordinator that was even more remote and smooth than Port Reuves.
She had come to the south with an older alignment that Kevern considered her aunt, inheriting a land in a mocked but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pie was lean, the trees were still spinning, nuts had left their traces on all the windows, and believed that they were all things, and the garden was overwhelmed with discontent that looked like huge coal creatures.
It was like the house of a child ’ s garden, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
The author's portrait: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is the longlist for the boat price of 2014.
Shortlist is announced next week.
Kevern had stayed cunningly with Ailn on ’ s brown love bottlenecks at the high level and enjoyed an unusually warm spring ’ s day, both dressed into the service consoles that provided the country with reassuring music and intriguing messages when the sight of its cruided brown had brought him to a bean old son at a black beacon of a long-store store.
Your feet is too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, Song ’ s own was no longer played by the consolation.
Not prohibited - nothing was properly banned - simply not played.
Successfully obsolete, as the word obsolves.
The general taste created what plastics and regulations never achieved, and how people in books chose the viom-millionaire memoirs, cochbooks, and love romanes, they chose the ballots in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary bottle and take large feet in a grob-comic Serenade Ailinns.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pioneer named Fat Wall," he explained it, and automatically laid two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done so to stop the letter before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers above your lip, it costs you a penny.
It was not a very amazing game at the time, nor was it very good now.
He knew that it was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn never heard of.
Jazz, though not prohibited directly, was not played.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was room for a single "when" in life. "
People wanted to be very sure at the start of a melodie, where it would end.
So is reason.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musical.
Although he had become 10 years old without listening to Sammy Davis Junior, he knew something about jazz about his father ’ s half-secret collection of CD ’ s.
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Wall was black.
At her age, she probably could not recall a time when pop singers were not black.
Once again, no laws or constraints were imposed.
A constant society meant that every element of this society gratefully approved the principle of group drafting - grateful like destiny.
People with African-Caribbean descent were well served by temperament and body building for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, and were charged with ensuring that no family remained family without a viable service phone.
What was left of the Polish community was concerned with channeling; what was left of the Greeks was broken down.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly when WAS GESCHEHEHENWAR, WENN EGESCHEHEVR -- feared being charged with firewalls, even fearing that the flames would consume them as next -- had been opened to laboratory and Shim-shipping restaurants.
Everyone according to its skills.
Having heard only Balladen, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just lectured her could ever be heard.
Music was an expression of love.
"Those are not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet is too big.
My father never insulated anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected guard gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could transcend the containment of the vast coherent leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father have loved this?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers back on the lips in their present.
She already thought that he was peculiar.
"It seemed like him," he said instead.
She shook her head indefinitely and blocked Keys ’ view.
There was nothing more to be seen around the world than their rampant black hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see otherwise.
"When you say it," they mean without conviction.
But this does not explain why you are paying attention to it.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet Too Big?
He looked again.
Your feet is not so straightforward.
Perhaps your need, a little bit small...
And you say you hate me for being too fat?
You hate?
Of course, I am not hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early to do so.
"Your deep need is precisely why you smuggled me," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That did not sound right.
It was supposed to be comical.
When he tried to be comical, he often got into trouble, because he, like his father, did not have the reassuring charm needed to tame the inherent cruelty in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Perhaps he wanted, shame, that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailn Solomon was rocked and drowned out of her love, thrown the console around and spoiled the wine they had drowned.
So darkness was not an excuse for him.
In their excitement, they seemed to quell like palmweeds in the storm.
"And your dicket is precisely why I feel too perverse to you," she said...
Unless I am at all.
She did so, both because of the unnecessary uncertainties of his words and the fear that they saw when she resisted him.
Do they think he would defeat them?
She had not told him of life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and iron old ocean broke up here as there were on the shores.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more profligate to DEM WAS GESCHEHEVAR when its ancestors had been smugglers and firewalls, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe to Kneipe to Kneipe, always willing to raise hands against a woman who refused or lost her.
Dicket?
They would have shown you a thick fist if they didn ’ t pass!
They were only buttressing - the most widely used word for erotic appeal between men and women, a counter-gift to the gender-based pleasures of Congo - they tip and then beat.
Keang ’ s view was unnecessary refinement, as the Kuchma himself was an act of violence.
Ailn Solomon gave him a sign of his body.
He went from love with an old man.
She also felt that she was here to stay, but she surprised the wolf of his mourning.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew.
She watched him off as he, like a spice in the upper floor, admitted to him a man, complained by what he himself had invoked.
Adam leaves the guard, she thought.
She felt sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her back, bow, shamed, beat, beat, with no fury - why was she a glimpse that she seemed to know well when she could not recall a single time she had seen so much before today?
Once she was alone, Ailinn Solomon looked their feet.
Several years before the recent events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old research commissioned for Ofnow, the non-legislative oversight body for the public mood, was briefly submitted for continued violence at low - and middle-level levels in which the reduction, if not elimination, would have been most likely to have been given energy, energy, and the money spent on eradication.
"Much has already been done, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who fought thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the country's remote corners and valleys, where, historically, the sweet of human friendship has rarely been felt, despite the high-flying rains between the sky.
But some traits turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the Kirchma appears to be, the less passion he continues to inspire.
People wear in the classes of sentimental ballots, chafe about overweening difficulties, and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the earlier raw keep rural communities, as well as our urban fabric, firmly in the hands, but also evidence of the emergence of a new and vexing contention at home, in the streets, and even in the field.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he read the entire report.
I suggest that you read less romance.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also need to ask: are you atheist?
"I don't think I don' t have to say that," Esme answered Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme referred to her right to privacy and to deny the statement.
Feminism?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz eventually said, "because I was opposed to atheism, reading, or feminism.
This is a for-profit job.
We serve a for-profit society.
But certain kinds of hypersensitivity that are inherently acceptable and commendable can occasionally distort results as you have imagined.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the church, and what you call "disgusting" and "roh" may well be interpreted by others as reflecting natural vigor and vitality.
Continuing on the sidelines, WAS GESCHEHEHENT, WENN GESCHEHEHENT IST, as if it had happened had happened yesterday, means taking the country its essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a Flamingorosa LED writing reiterated the advice Ofnow offered to the country over the last quarter-century or more.
If you smile your neighbor, value your partner, listen to Balladen, visit musicals, use your phone, tell you, hear you, hear you vote, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the healthy word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want," Esme Nussbaum responded with a calm voice when it was certain that her superiors had ended, "and I say nothing more than that we are not as cured yet as we are doing ourselves.
My worry is that without warning, we may find ourselves reversing how to repeat the mistakes that led to DEM WAS GESCHEHEHENT IST, WENN ES GESCHEHEHENT IST.
This time, however, it is not the others where we abandon our anger and suspicion.
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with hands.
To suggest patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you call action a" mistake "that our grandparents may or may not have made.
They go too far, too, even if you say that they had eliminated their "anger" and "distrust" of "others."
It should not be necessary to remind someone of your position that we speak of "us" and "others" in understanding the past, as we did in protecting the present.
There was no "us" and there were no "other."
It was a time of disorder; that is all we know.
"Of those who are honest of ourselves to" wear egg, "no part of society can claim to have good behavior.
I don ’ t appease anyone.
Whether it has been bad or done what happened has happened.
That was then.
None of this needs to be said - since we agree.
And, just as no debt must be owed, so no guilt must be extinguished if such a narrative were appropriate and if there were a way to destroy it.
But what the past serves if we don't learn from it.
The past serves to make us forget them.
When I can say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
“I will consider their report, ” he said, and dismissed it.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overrun by a motorcycle who, as Passants described it, had drifted to the sidelines in a way of "brutal rage."
There are accidents.
Lesothood ’ s military official says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Military officials in Lesotho denied that they were planning a coup to topple the government, saying that they were taking action against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, telling it that the country ’ s army had shifted its habit and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting on assassination threats.
Military spokesmen Major Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military responds to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose armed forces confronted it.
"What happened tomorrow was that the staff of Lesotho Defense Forces acted after receiving multiple intelligence reports that some elements within the police wanted to arm some of the political young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc with the Voice of America."
South African Governor Clayson Monyela has said that military action has made the impression of overthrow.
"Although no one has claimed to have overturned the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho Defense Forces have so far indicated signs of a coup," he said.
Speaker of the military of Lesotho said on Sunday that soldiers would retreat to their barracks, and that the situation was calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetyoya Metsing is taking over governance during Thabane ’ s absence.
Thabane said that he had become a target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June, after Thabano suspended parliamentary meetings due to divisions in his unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite loud accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, a study closely observed.
The final market for purchasing managerial (PMI) index fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
More than 50 starting points to expansion.
New contracts declined, and factories broke down at a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive at the European Central Bank ’ s meeting on Donbas Day.
Markets expect the Bank to make a clear plan to deal with a reluctant eurozone recovery, as well as with the threat of deflation at just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could report this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, commensurate with that made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although little growth is better than growth at all, the dampening effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for producers have become clearer," Rwhether Dobson, a leading economist, said at Markit.
The Fabrik PMI for Germany, Russia ’ s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months, at 51.4.
In the meantime, the PMI fell to 46.9 in the bloc ’ s second largest economy, France.
France remains a sorrow, as does Italy ’ s decline from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial entities are no longer available to Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also are not reassuring, "Mr. Dobson said.
The decline in industry probably fuels the fires of analysts who expect more monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
As Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, has said, "The best that can be said for the 2008 2008 2008 purchasing manager for the manufacturing industry in the eurozone is that the sector will continue to grow."
It added: "Productors in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult now, as heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with respect to Russia and Ukraine - increase in the persistence of difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – especially, and consumer confidence – with some contracts likely to be delayed or even canceled, particularly large contracts.
He said that, though we suspect that this will be limited, it is "increasingly likely that the ECB will have to initiate some kind of QE."
Ten years of schooling have passed on to the survivors of Beslan. Ten years have passed since its dreadful schooling siege, as the children that it now suffers.
A decade ago, more than 1,000 people were held hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the Greueltat in the classroom.
Just a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, that seemed like the bad guys.
The tragedy united West and East into revulsion, and, surprisingly, turned to action and hope for the future in the midst of worst distress.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of these terrorist hells will persecute them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war now afflicting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is ending.
The girl who was photographed in trying to climb back into the shattered school sports hall.
It was photographed and famously by Russia ’ s start-up photograph, Dimitri Beliakov, when she tried only to climb back into the shattered school sports after a mine exploded.
By contrast, Aida searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
Both were considered dead, but survived.
"One woman told me that I should burn for my life, but I could not," Aida said at the time.
My legs were blood-soaked.
I stood up and climbed again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After several surgery, she thought she was completely cured, but said yesterday, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I fear that I will have to be restored.
Some grenades are still in my knees.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help the people get help from doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me up," she says.
"That has happened to me, and it can not be changed.
Once a year, I am always in the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classroom, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always be part of it, even though memory is weakening somewhat every year.
I am happy that many people around the world remember our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I watch the photograph online, as I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe, and help to ensure that this is not happening again.
The boy flying through the Kugelhagel believes that his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (Russians go to school for seven years) and survived the three-day siege in his mother ’ s poor.
As he said, "Mama has told me that when there was an explosion, I should go hand in hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "Rise."
He fled and watched on the path of a weary little child, took the hand, and fled through a bullet.
"Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I could not save them."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled to the sidelines, and was injured with hospital injuries, on the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I wept with joy.
I couldn ’ t believe it.
He burned and embraced me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-dissolved News of the World) newspaper to get a Barnardo ’ s Children ’ s Champion title from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror bears you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will be anathema in my memory.
I still know that, right after that, I threw away all my toy pilots.
But now I can play computer games with checkpoints, which is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid of going back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the court and have not moved out.
We never say that they are killed or dead.
We say that they remain in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London, especially the wait-and-see camps, where I could choose everything I wanted, and that journey into an open car at the top.
But now he is scared for places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered.
This horror bears you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the Greeks," Damir said last week, who worked as volunteers in a monasteries.
I like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me at the school academia next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible silence of the siege, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and that silent lasted many months.
She vividly recalls her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London wept when I told our history.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our emotions and show their support.
She was grateful for Blair and her foundation to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the London meeting with me, and how the Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschch, and they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with cellers in a restaurant, and Damir shot at them and burned them away with him with his water pistol.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so readily shared our pain and supported us.
She said, “I always think that this world has not gotten better in those 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is continuing, and people die every day, and I believe many children have been killed and still killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war, part of the news they hear when they are soft or preoccupied with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all of the horror.
And I can not stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir has become big and is a very soft and quiet boy; he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He, for example, does not seek revenge; he is not overwhelmed by past bodies.
I do not know that he likes to recall, but he has six close class friends, and he occasionally goes to the sports halls and breathe candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered under it - for hours I remember how he sometimes turned to the sofa that deflects the face of us.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he continued his weapons and other military vehicles, Damir is now 17, larger than I see, look good, intelligent, and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered and got on my feet after the explosion, I saw hell around me, watching hell around me, with all surrounding bodies.
I was absolutely sure that my small boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I ascribed him to" Damir "circulation," but I was so sure he didn't listen.
But he listened, and he has run away.
So life, unlike that of many, continues for us.
Georgia ’ s Ilyin, 17
The Young, whose terrible image became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan after the siege, became a symbol of Greuel.
Troubled: Georgia ’ s post-2004 Beslane Survival, with its mother Fatima, an image on the right today of Georgia.
His blood-laden face was marked by fear when he died, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classrooms.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beslan barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, canceled him for his first school day before rushing free to bring her older son, Vladimir.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, so my little boy left there for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not entirely, since it was an entire family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
As that date approaches, it is harder to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don ’ t think it was long ago, I think it would have been yesterday to watch some scenes of those days.
No one will ever forget that, I tell you.
Importantly, the image of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack, and was conjured as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgia wanted to go to school this day, saying that he wanted to impoverish his teachers.
I knew only when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of Georgia ’ s weary San Marino.
Georgia does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the books at home.
I understand this, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.
Georgia now says, "It's important that never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are exploring the fall of that boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because when you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how is it?
Ten years are not at all such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then got it better.
I returned to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classrooms killed.
That is why I will always be in the sports hall as September 1 approaches.
I want to take a toll on my old child friends.
I have a hard time going into the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel a victim; that story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I don ’ t help.
My lives continue.
I finished school this year and visited a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first election was an army training.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgia ’ s Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped in the feet of a murderous terrorist.
One miracle: Georgia ’ s Faniyev was trapped in the siege of a murderous terrorist, but managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall, sitting next to the bomb that was firmly on the footing of a murderous terrorist.
It is really surprising that he was not killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgia, who wanted to be a FSB intelligence officer, but could not do so because of its health damage from the siege.
It is still with me that it is not what I left behind.
I am older now, and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that is wrong.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt something better about them, but I can not forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the first and only time I went back to the sports hall in 2005.
I lost awareness.
I will never return to it again, and don ’ t ask me to show you where I have been in this famous picture.
Survival: Georgia ’ s Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the Laptop
My pain is huge, and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I don ’ t like to think or talk about it, and they never asked about it.
I know how well I have.
I should be careful about my wounded knee, but I can do well now.
But, because of my health, I could not attend the FSB ’ s Securities Academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have included my documents, including medical records, and answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the medical institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, “I knew I would never report to my children my experience.
Children should not know, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother, Marina 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to memory celebrations.
I know that Georgia will not go.
He needs to be much more intense, because he was not there and I.
I waited at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, all of whom are recorded in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgia is now an adult, but that horror is still within it.
It is hard to accept this when it comes to such an unfairness.
He is a boy, he may be sports, but he can not attend because of his knees.
It has been operated in multiple ways, it can run, but it can not drive sports.
I would say that he has surpassed the horror by 50%, but that can never be fully overcome and forgotten.
This terrible experience will always persist.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, which only reinforces my pain.
I have lost many of the people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift God could do to me, but my heart wins around the grains.
I know from families where new children were born, but also from widows that never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life will continue, even if one does not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can almost not believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we be fighting now?
People and children suffer; I am sure that many children have been killed and many more have been killed in Ukraine.
If only we could grab and propose all of these rebels, as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, so amazingly enamored by a special commander, was secured.
Look at it: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special commander (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not recall the cruelties at all.
The world stood its breath in 2004, when the Baby Aljona was taken from the siege of Beslan to the poor in a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let them go, but they held back their 30-year-old mother, Cristina ’ s 10-year-old sister and her brother brother in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona ’ s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and, with his new wife, Svlana, has a small girl calling him after his lost daughter, Cristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not recall the siege and grew to a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a phantom father, and wants to save her all the memories raised by the tenth anniversary.
They will understand why.
Men accuse girls of having crossed girls in fishing on pedestrians
A 78-year-old man is on trial in fisheries because of a three-year-old girl ’ s experience.
Gordon Steward is accused of driving a girl on the transition to East New York Pittenween.
The indictment indicates that Mr. Steward managed his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from instruments since, denied the accusation to the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC began the proceedings for January.
4 Tpps for Better Water photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a leaner Point-and-Shoot, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are around $300.
I have taken these photos from a family with multiple cameras, all available at less than $350.
Regardless of equipment, there are some rules for the best outcomes.
Taking control of your equipment twice.
Even if you have a leaner camera, you are reassured that the battery and other fields are closed.
Think of your camera as well as the photos or videos you want to absorb.
Some cameras and Camcordes have scenes and posturing memodes that optimize the conciliation time for the Danish underwater environment.
And before you arrive, consider what depth your equipment can function.
Some cameras are allowed to take up to 5 foot, others up to 50 or 60.
Try for conventional and watertight models in our shopping bosses and digitized valuations.
Make multiple takeovers - because many will not soften.
Poinand-Shoot-cameras have a LCD with which you can complicate images, usually not action-Campaign.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to watch it underwater, and the right imaging is a good luck.
So you are doing many things.
If your camera has a travel mode, with a series of recordings made with easily changed certifications, use it.
Let you stay close to the surface.
Light becomes dramatically worse the more you move away from the surface.
So, if possible, you will stay on the surface when you make a pool, a lake, or a sea.
The deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Consider the objects.
This is a good countryside, too, but it is all the more important because of poor lighting conditions under water.
It is particularly important to work with an Action Cam: these devices often have a fixed window of wheat, which means that you will have to turn younger to your objects if they are to fill the entire dragon.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character is changing, even in a giant organization like the NHS.
As a consultative doctor, he has devoted his career to saving the sick from both the agony and the source of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, an MI6 staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and diseases, while the disabled are mostly preoccupied with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose passage began.
"I did not feel myself," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty coming up with me.
As he struggled with the flat-like symptoms, he realized that he was impatient for his wife, Juliet.
"I prefer everything sooner than later," he noted.
When Juliet was a week in a business trip, Lawson felt unusual and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to make a X-ray investigation of his breast.
Just two weeks ago, he had been a kidney in the French nightmares.
The result of X-rays investigation was premised.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast, i.e., the leaks overarching skin.
As with most cancer, the precise trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are ill with lung cancer, not all lung cancer has been smokers earlier.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asphylactic – contact with the fiber material, which was once considered a "magic bullet" but has now been considered lethal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbebest, after all, is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asset was no longer used in the United Kingdom since the 1960 ’ s, when industry voluntarily pledged to stop using it.
There, too, only people in certain industries worked directly with plumbers, construction workers, cadres, and advertisers, for example.
As an industrial resource from another age, it hardly seems worrisome today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the culmination of a Mesolthelio epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from the disease as in traffic accidents.
The UK ’ s Nutrient Data of Mesotheliom-Deadly Deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths.
The reason we are seeing the lethal effects now, though asbestos have been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos have been banned), is that a Mesothom is only evolving after decades.
And the scourge of Mesotheliom is not confined to former construction workers.
Asbest was, and is often still, in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn, and the businesses in which we buy.
And so Mesotheliom does not know about class, financial boundaries, professions, or old age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant purchasers in London to private schools, are not a safe haven.
The parliamentary buildings are anathema.
In the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this lethal carcinogen started.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a plumber.
Indeed, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come to touch with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks as if there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Guy'Hospital, where I completed my education for six years."
All students - students, nurses, doctors, and papers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my elders will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could at least partly answer that question.
"Of the four doctors trained at the Guy's Hospital and who have been ill in Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "" I'm the last to live. "
How many of us will suffice?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at age 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long time for survival.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomatic diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will be ill?"
The UK ’ s leading expert on Mesotheliom, professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the UK ’ s assisted epidemic is expected to crumble, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have died.
Most now have no idea that they will die.

A short look at the courts ’ files, which often turn to them for compensation claims, shows just how widespread the scourge of Mesothelioms is.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was ridiculously exposed to asbestos.
For nine years, it worked for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her work at M & S.
Now it has two children in the twenties.
"Before this," she says, "I have never heard of Mesotheliom; I have not even known anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that would affect me once.
Few people know much about asbestos.
The fact is that asbestos do not include a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word "assignation form," a description of the fast-structure that makes it resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysov, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most widely trapped asbean in buildings today.
It has been used to keep chairs, pedestrian boards, raw materials, boileries, even for brakes in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of assist, yet the EU and the WTO consider it "a major health risk" with possible death.
But the brown asbestove (Amosit) and the blue asbeth (Crokydolith) are more dangerous.
The United Kingdom was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for the uniquely high level of mesotheliommunications."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was suspended to Alamy in the flagship store on Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as typical Mesotheliomans, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has submitted a study by those affected who report that "a significant proportion of the pesothelies without known labour or home presumably were caused by environmental reviews."
Much of this contact is based on our buildings' "normal use and aging."
No one appears certain.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the palace of Westminster, shows that, like people at the heart of the government, they might have been unwittingly exposed to the stuff.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the serviceans and pipes were contaminated behind parliamentary committees of asbestos whose lethal fiassailants could be dismantled by something as harmless as "strong aerial movements."
MPs are often blamed for addressing their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Direction of the Parliamentary Working Service insisted that the West Clinian Palace had received a "clean health," it is now undeniable that £1 billion has to be spent several years to renovate Parliament, modernize the electric installations, and remove the asbestos, and that, after the general election in 2015, legislators will probably meet more in nearby QE2 Conference than in the green mines.
The Godford report also pointed out that "Asbestove's presence was not handled according to its provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
A person never able to control contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suggests that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital in which accusations have been positive," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all places where you worked, and in the data.
What he is reminiscent of is the day in early December 2009 when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and it just ended up conducting operation late in the day.
Suddenly, I had shafts.
Suddenly.
I felt frightening.
I believed that I could no longer make the journey home.
As a doctor, he knew that the pain stemmed from the fraud, the skin surrounding his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom.
He did not go to work a month.
Astonishingly, doctors used his breast ’ s X-rays and used Pleurakathether to take flirtation from the leaks and test in the laboratory.
But his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after physical activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient came with similar symptoms in his practice, and was later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But now Abbott did not do so with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection here was clear.
Abbott ’ s condition deteriorated again in September 2011, and his doctor brought his CTSC and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera sun was introduced to the height between the river and the breast.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep saying, ” he says.
Frankly, I had not worried so much at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was a week between Christmas and New Year: "It was said to me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had Termine with Macmilean nurses, one of whom he recommended taking a lawyer.
Only now did he grasp the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos were very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where royals were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
So Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous piece of assignation in hospitals was underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the stuff.
But many of the staff who switched from one building to another (for example, Andrew Lawson) or underground canals (as Graham Abbott often did) came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but they are life-threatening to the doctors who treated them.
He is still removed today.
Students turned their tunnels on assistants.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestove was often used in offices, stores, libraries, and urban halls, owing to its virulent isolated and flattening characteristics.
Schools, too.
Indeed, many people may have had the first advertising act in the classroom.
Across the country, thousands of chemicals, students have turned their tabloid beans to assistants.
On Web sites, asbestos are now often addressed in schools.
Meanwhile, as innocent items have been in our homes as innocent as soccer platforms or shop subjects have been standard asbestores.
"It is an industrial institution that contains much of our real estate," observed Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that one affected woman invented was the removal of a garden shop in the 1970 ’ s.
So you are adapting to how you are slashing your garden shots.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is curable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I could not focus on what I was doing.
I was two weeks in practice.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Na yes, I will not see any more Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the outlook changed from being a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he is reminded of how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to get.
"It was very difficult to absorb everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor" how long do I have? "
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember that I thought "Na yes," I will not see another Christmas festival.
That was then "."
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious, because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by assembly contacts.
Asbestos are made up of small fathers.
When asbestowed and the fiassailants are inflamed, they can settle for lungs in the breast, the skin surrounding the ladies.
Asfiners irritate breast incidents and can trigger cell surgery.
"The problem arises from the illiterate nadelect assailants," Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who changed to the Guy's hospital in 2001.
Ironically, the hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects is subjected to asbestos, is now a leading center in treating Mesotheliom.
Treasury officials knew Lawson, and treated some others who were also likely to be exposed during their hospital training.
Once assistants reach lung tissue, they say, "they are marginalized by the respiratory process where the skin is.
From the outset, it is invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well in Mesotheliom.
The efficacy of an operation, for example, is hotly contentious.
Some say that it is worth trying.
Sovereign connections.
"You can not cut off the breast," he says.
They don ’ t get around the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows" but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasuries.
But in the end they die everyone.
Fortunately, some patients really live long, much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
Having contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advisory office for the affected.
"Hallo" cancer center, "he was suspicious when called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier, and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles, which took four months and would probably extend his life by just one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lavson managed "to make things seem in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lazdunski, a heart thorax specialist in the Guy.
"We had an advantage by not having to be expelled, I just called, and received a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive transmission and wait for treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial to Mesotheliom-disease to track the best treatments available.
But when these treatments invariably fail, many individuals are afraid of another financial concern - about the future of families they leave.
So they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson countered Field Fisher Waterhouse LP ’ s Andrew Morgan.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos are extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 ’ s is that it recognized that very little burden was also a risk to health.
And here, companies ’ neglect began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy ’ s Hospital eventually put their case in place, but it was not what Morgan called a “complete compensation, ” since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an assistant at the Guy.
But, after investigating his death, a Guy spokesman confirmed that "the asbeans were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990's."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Fail
Indeed, it is a huge problem for Mesotheliom-illness who seek compensation to attribute the lethal assist of a firm or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Deposits can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been strong new legislation this year that makes it easier for Mesotheliom-patients to charge compensation even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law established a $350 million fund, funded by the insurance industry, for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, can detect contact but can not sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court could have said in a normal compensation process – roughly £120,000.
Some 300 successful proposals are expected to be made per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesotheliom-Better people, thinks that £350 million was a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, indicates that this amounts to one-quarter of what insurers would have paid if time had not gone away and Mesothelio ’ s disease had to find businesses and normally sue them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labor and Pension, also admitted that the law was "imperfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, with seven deaths per day, rapid action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of Mesothelio's law in December of last year.
At that point, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first deliberations, long-term Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasuries, would have a positive impact.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy in which long-term Lazdunski can represent a survival rate of up to 40% for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.
They see this over and over again in patients.
There is something that keeps you going.
If you burn up, you will get worse off very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he had outlived the last six chemotherapy cycles.
Subsidies showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a spcan in March 2014.
There were several cancers around my breast.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-support.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now it is no longer a trail of tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally demanding.
They need to think about practical things - for example, money when I am no longer, or my wife shows how the book job works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
They need to look forward.
That is not always easy as the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14.
"This is hard for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed first, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They responded differently.
Tamsin is very healthy and unhealthy.
She told her friends, and we soon got very many calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must endure.
But such talks are not riddled with hope, not a trail of survival.
The disease brings grim security (just as it ended up doing for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong Right to Government Election, demonstrators Contrace retribution
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament, despite calls for democratic reform to block the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections, ruled by Hong Kong ’ s electorate.
This is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong ’ s commercial districts, while activists orchestrated planning and mobilization to do so within a few hours of permission.
The decision by the Chinese People ’ s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to reject all non-peer candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it enrages us," said legal expert Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
Hong Kong ’ s residents were laughed.
And it is clear that we face an authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that permitting public nominations to be too "chaotic" in Hong Kong's government elections.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the residents choose the government ’ s president from 2017 onward.
The Chinese leadership presented the Sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong ’ s citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that China ’ s leaders have kept the process firmly in the hands of a narrow Beijing nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates are to be allowed "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong ’ s largest and most publicized protests took place in many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace Movement, whose organizers threatened to close down the financial district unless Beijing permits genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday ’ s day night, hundreds of Occupy Central followers gathered in the rain before the head of government in Hong Kong within hours.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience, planning for protest waves in the coming weeks.
But they failed to do so, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online message, the organizers said that the movement "took into account" the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action to take place only when all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted, and that the occupation of the central district will take place definitively.
Hong Kong ’ s authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and increased security measures, including police forces and barricades, were needed on Sunday ’ s government building.
The unrest is aggravated by many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The flow of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement's demonstrations, threatening the business enterprise -- Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many of them participate and how long they continue," said legal expert Revic Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don ’ t want to stoke fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China ’ s state-controlled media also recently reported democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on the voting rights in which 780,000 people participated – more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
Tens of thousands participated in one of the region ’ s largest democratic demonstrations in its history.
The tradition of school diploma in the US is now transferred to universities where freshops are offered with the private airliner.
We are pleased to respond to this demand and offer Britain ’ s first luxurious travel service to students of today.
In order to achieve an especially impressive university performance, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten, or McLar P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service had a security savings.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to calibrate their departments in a dangerously overloaded car from the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of outlays and maximum of luxury.
One corporate spokesperson said that no new accounting is yet underway, because the service was just being introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it expected a market for that supply.
Students today are very different from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF can do just that.
But the National Student Union criticized the service as being.
As Megan Dunn, NUS Vice President for Higher Education, has said, "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis in the cost of living, as the available financial support, in the form of loans and scholarships, does not keep pace with sharply rising bills for the easiest livelihoods before they can ever think about spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as the arrival of the student home.
Feminists criticize race and police behavior after Ferguson.
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Moore.
The participants raised their hands and sang "hands high, not shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in online white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race in addressing reproductive law and income inequality.
But, while tensions in the Middle East increased and received attention across the country, Perez saw that white women ’ s answers turned to 100% of the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the students of August 9, personal essays came with titles like "Think to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism" is not just about the suppression of women "relatively late.
But for Perez, this represented an important change.
“I don ’ t think feminism can find many people who are white and privilege in such classic ways, ” she said.
People felt urged to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in which we are, and because the situation in Ferguson is so racial that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed problems faced by black American women every day but not considered "women" in the cultural area.
“I can publish something amazing on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 liks everywhere, ” Mitchell said.
When I trump some of how color is under siege in her own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public sphere?" she asked.
There is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems for black women who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of cleaning up the issues; they live every day in the combined reality.
Whereas white women now combine race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a female professor and a female professor at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"From 1865 to 1890, at least 10,000 black men were registered, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynchemy.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white fighters analyzed the country in the late 19th century for women ’ s suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, and found that the fight for voting could succeed only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to advocate for women ’ s suffrage, and voting for blacks should come later, ” said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one understands with power why non-white women don ’ t trust white women.
We have not done our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received suffrage in 1920, white women took a decade to organize themselves against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group arose almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fish" with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be tolerable if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms are as serious about raising a child as they do with the right to control recipients?" asked Mitchell?
Second generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to receptive resources now try to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Stone went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, publishing an article by Rebecca Carroll, a Guardian columnist demanding more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallels reason to understand a danger inherent to the body -- and opinions on the race that is very different in public opinion -- will lead the changes," wrote Stein.
Although stones may favor a more intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some have been stunned by their comments on race in America.
Christina Sommers, an American Enterprise Institute researcher and writer "Who Stole Feminism?" said to The People that young men in the United States, especially young Black Men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but "Steinem's remarks to Ferguson are contrasting to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother ’ s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black men and Hispanic men, there were bitter reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that mainstream feminism is pressing forward.
After the US border police took up nearly 63,000 unseated minority years on the country's Southwest border this year, immigration reform has returned to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that, for a reconsideration of the issue as a major women ’ s issue, they must only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women that accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in women's organizations," she said.
"Pig House" in Ipwich is for sale
The image of a house on the sale was removed from real-estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The freeing house has a bedroom, is on a private street in Ipswich, and is offered £120,000.
Among the details were a home buyer - including a pig that had bestowed his head on a sofa.
Housing maker Connell said that the pig was the homeowner ’ s skin.
"But the photo was mistakenly published and has been removed," said one corporate spokesperson.
In the House's exposé, Connell described the former assembly as a "unique one-family home with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the picture from the Web site, it does not appear in advertising material.
Housing sold interest in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in a purchase price.
Harvey, the SWF city, is home to a new millionaire after receiving lots.
A Harvard Loan Gambler is Up This month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a happy winner receiving almost $1.1 million from charging on Saturday.
A Harvard newspaper kiosk drew the jackpot for the second time in five years in the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The fortunate winner, however, has yet to register.
The shrewd owner Steve Forward said that it should fund talks in the small city of Perth in the southwest.
The city talks about nothing else, and everyone is pretty much upset.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated gains last month in the first vision, a fee-for-all conclusion for a few happy weeks for state players.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont earned $7.5 million in mega-profits just a few weeks earlier.
The winning few had played for twenty years, saying that they would allow them to travel to the world and buy a new house.
Harvard ’ s millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonies Pushed into the Gladiatorena
Not only were the gladicians in the sun ’ s first Rhineland Day of Friday.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1,000 visitors yesterday who defied the rainforests, the calves, and were enthusiastically enthusiastic by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful journey of depictions, recordings, games, faculty, and information about the Roman era and its importance to the Rhineland.
The main purge of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighter force of the Gladiatory-school "Amor Mortis," which used every rainy break to demonstrate its robust combat arena in the soft-sand arena.
Gladiatory-owners "Leonida" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presentor, sending their men into the ring as a heroic two-day struggle in various gladiatorways.
First, the "provocators" were at the top of the line of justifications, short-sighted, anti-left-leaning, and anti-poor people on the right.
It was followed by the "Essedarii," with mastectomy, short script, worm, iron gladiatorhelm, bone and poverty protection.
Most impressive was the arrival of the "Rearitius," which came with worm, thirst, and dolf against the "Secutor," and recently swept the burning.
Because the heavy lifts metallically intertwined, pilgrimage, and worm crops surged through the arena that fear and progress could become a health of gladicians.
But the impossious "Summa Rudi," the muscular referee, had an ever-attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Rome enduring," explained Lorence Euskirchen, Chairman of the ceremonial "Freedom Circle," the intensification behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the leisure park for one day became an "opium of Romanum," a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage observed in his plea.
After all, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and many structures that we admire today.
Residues of this were also too great on Rome Day, such as the "Aquädukt-Marmor" of the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Römerkanal bridge that it once was in the library.
The front-line society once confronted the supply of water and energy and now, and businessmen Petra Fricke knew, "We are still getting the benefit of knowledge back then."
This also confirms diploma's measurement engineer Ralph Heiger of the "Engineering Two" from Rheinbach, who presented measurements from Romans such as Chorobat, Groma, or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented both the kickbacks and models of the explosions of 1894 and the bricks of the Original mortgage, the warmth heating that once poured the ROmervilla.
Besides, in print, the footprints left by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago were left in the Ton footsteps before they were burned.
In 2011, Rheinland ’ s office had buried the vestiges of a Roman villa in the commercial park of North in Rheinbach.
A commercial building was found with a sentence to dry up grains and paintings.
The building was probably a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity, explained by the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morocco.
A series of pieces of these explosions presented it in a glasvitrine, including a large seller, several fine fiber vessels, and parts of a cellular half-chain.
The Villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century to Christius, to the fall of the Germanes in Rhineland, suspected of murders.
In her, the children also engaged in the Roman wind-mill game, much like today ’ s refrigerator, or they wrote their names with metal blasts on swimming.
At the level of the pile of raw thermal, the children allowed Mosaiks themselves to relax, peer at the level of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach Glasmosaic, and eggs at the level of the natural center of El Nettersheim to serve a heavy wheat mill from a stone to chase the furniture for a box or a gystrophy.
With the original roadmap built by two cold blowers, the resident park removed the visitors from the leisure park, also at the stunning level of the town of Gymnasium, which represented the results of its "Rome Project."
In a week of September 13 to 21, the Waterberg Community will also invite itself to the year 2014 that Kaiser Augustus died 2000 years ago.
Along with home and history clubs, water vouchers, partnership clubs, and bourgeois games are offered, among other things, mathematical migrations, a lecture, co-chasing, and schooling leaders, and a reminder of the Roman past of Weibergs.
In the process, for example, a Roman legion is told of its work on the suitable waters, presents plants as living traits of the Rome Age, and offers a ludicrous hour in international agreement between a group of waterbergers "Germanes" and allocated Romans.
Adendorkovych ’ s primary school is devoted to the Rome issue in a project week.
The week of Rome is a lot, but often not at first glimpse, of the Roman Romans in Weiberg.
The waters of Rathouse will remind a small presentation to the 1879 editor of the 1879 Games Fund.
Ebola: Burdened West Africa ’ s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned – and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealt a severe blow to West Africa ’ s economy.
crop eradication in fields that leave mines and markets are orphaned - the virus has made it difficult for the region to plant.
Some international companies, too, are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, the head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is Hardest affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells in Liberia's second-largest market in Monrovia's capital, Monrovia Kleisure.
The market has only about who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 people killed here alone.
Recently, health officials said that the disease was rampant in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
Overall, more than 1,500 people died, and thousands more were hiding.
Foreign Companies are Losing Workers
Everywhere in resource-rich countries, firms are extracting their operations.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flooding the affected regions.
Domestic traders and farmers also respond: few merchants still leave their homes to postpone supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia that are quarantine, such as export cocococoa and coffee crops in the field.
The farmers dared not to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food Grows Ground Shut
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Paris expert on West Africa's economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables tends to stay home.
The population is thus directly and urging to feel the consequences of the epidemic: food is scarce.
In markets, supply of staple foods such as rice is disappearing.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international firms threatens an image damage – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies essentially shun the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris.
The key is how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors may think that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, and therefore invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burden strained government budgets.
The disease also strains the already strained national budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that its budget will be tightened sharply by high spending on health care and the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to help the affected countries ’ health systems $60 million ($45 million).
The impact is already present in Nigeria, where so far few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
To be sure, the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But many people elsewhere are already staying home for fear of contagion.
Reserves in hotels also fall sharply.

Only in 1964 did 19 young men who lifted the "new" protégé forest "of Berngau on April 30 in Luka's gas thumb.
Karl and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult season, mainly to find a local unit and install the shale operations.
In the autumn of 1965, the protein club launched "Leininger" with two teams in the Rundenauer struggles.
In the years following, the sports shields, now organized in seven teams, evolved in all classes to the 1 th Gauliga.
The records poured up every year, and the magic line of 380 struggles was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980.

Tony Stewart Comes to the Road
Tony Stewart ’ s return to the railroad ended, for example, halfway through his race on the Atlantic Motor Speedway.
For the second time, the Wall came down after its rightful run-up burst and ended its evening in 172.
His damaged car was steadily weakened, leaving it without talking to journalists.
His chief executive, Chad Johnston, said that his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race in Richmond, Virginia, next weekend.
"I wished that we had better deployment and better results for him," said Johnston.
We go to Judge and hope that we can do better there.
Once upon Sunday ’ s ray, a collision with Kyle Busch was already entering a wall and had to repair the right side of his watch.
"I have now met with reasonably good hopes for a good outcome," said Johnston, adding, "It simply did not fail."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart ’ s car was invited, and the team had packed and was ready to ride.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup race after his car hit and killed another driver on a roadside in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week, winning either in Atlanta or in the next race in Judge to gain a place in prosecution.
He returned to his job, investigating the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had taken to the journey during a race to confront continuity.
The authorities acknowledged on Friday that the investigation caused the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet to decide whether stewart must face charges.
The three-page champion was received with great applause when envisaged before the race.

Bulgaria ’ s Prisons Stay Nationally
Hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest in the capital, Sofia, before the justice ministry.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated demands to restore their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new hours, demanding a return to the former 24-hour classes.
Despite meeting between prison workers and judicial officials, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) was reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director-General Directorate for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
Protest of the prison workers is likely to be supported by members of the union of interior ministry employees.
Ukraine ’ s Army Happened Loughshares
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russia fighters remain on the march.
Today, after a serious struggle that allegedly included Russian tank batons, the Ukrainian army, Monday, has abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn personal consequences from his army ’ s severe defeat in the struggle against separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without detail.
Prorussian separatists Shoot Airplane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists, after their own portrayal, have reshot a warplane and two military helicopters.
Roughly 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in Donetsk region, according to the insurgents shared Russian agencies on Monday.
Sinking the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed that, for the first time in the Azeri Sea, they had sinking two vessels of the Ukrainian Coast Guard.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships on Sunday were under attack near the port city of Mariupol.
Yet seven border guards were injured, said a speaker in Kyiv to the station 112 th.
Two occupation members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported controlling several places in Donetsk.
The Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In Belarus ’ s capital, Minsk, Ukraine ’ s contact group is now meeting.
As well as representatives of Ukraine, Russia, and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should participate.
In the run-up, all actors used their performances to announce their demands publicly.
NATO Won ’ t Be Ending Russia
NATO will not renounce its agreement with Russia, owing to the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a stark break" with the agreement.
"Today, we must face up to the reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," he said.
Russian documents and statements show that they view us as adversaries. "
A Stronger NATO presence
Racial has also announced plans to increase NATO ’ s presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is needed," said Rasmusses on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on New Gas Talks
Russia and Ukraine, according to this view, have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
Negotiations are set for coming Saturday, said the Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A European Union decision is still being awaiting whether it also ends up sending a representative to the talks.
Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks to weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies for Europe.
Europe draws roughly one-third of its gas from Russian sources, much of which goes through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks to the word of power: watching will be "clear."
Now the chancellor is clearly committed to doing so again.
But it is not a free lunch for all the complicated details.
Continued concerns from the CDU against the PKew have grown up with the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken of power after continuing resistance from her CDU to the establishment of a Pew watching.
"To put it bluntly, she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," said the party boosters on Monday after meetings of the CDU ’ s leaders in Berlin.
But, for the time being, Merkel has not embarked on a detailed model.
The Black Red Government Program calls "certain parameters."
Germany's Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is here to work."
The NRC, however, insists on its No to watch on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also provided constructive guidance for a bill.
Beyond the issue, he has also spoken of more opportunities to raise more private capital for infrastructure investment, including broadband.
"Not at all," Schäuble had uncommissioned a "mirror" report on Sunday, his house was considering a concept of its own to pay highway investors with tolls, after the 2017 election.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer has warned against developing authentic concepts in the cabinet against the leading minister.
CDU Federal Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed to reinforce all circles and federal roads," the North Rhine-western CDU chairman said.
As a result, it is an important signal that maritime lawyers have now announced that they are talking about the issue again.
Opposition to plans comes from the CDU associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland Pfalz.
The background is fear that watching will affect small border lines with neighboring states.
Search courts had called for coalition loyalty because of the CDU ’ s authors.
The left regards plans as having failed in the face of the Union dispute.
"The Murdoch watchword is dead," said Party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnable-Review."
"The watchdog fails of the minister," which is intent on establishing a veto service on all the German roads to launch in 2016.
But domestic car owners can not be further burdened under the Coalition Treaty.
So they should be given a full offset for the waters via the Kfzz tax.
The model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality under EU law.
Making Genetic Disorder Wrong
One British says that she thought that she would die for many years as a result of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
Indeed, it suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and backward marrow.
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnoses were a common problem with CMT people, because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK probably suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecurity, and mutilated flows.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rod13 was, she believed that she was suffering from Friedman ’ s taxy (FA) – a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodger thought she would be in the roles before she would be 18, and would die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are now 51 years old said, "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others.
I continued to fall, and everything lasted with me for longer.
I could never drive with the other children of Rollushh or Skateboard, and I was often trapped in school for my way.
Rodger said that she saw her medical records as her doctor left the room at age 13, and las she suffered from FA, after several operations to depress her Achilles ’ bearings and stirring her feet.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't have told anyone, but I went home, searched for the illness in the library, and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and horribly panicked.
I thought I would be in the roles and die with 18, and then all would slowly lose my capabilities.
I did it all with me alone, planning my own funeral.
She said when she became 17 that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He simply stood up, and told me, "My love, I don't think you're hastening otherwise, if you are already in the roles."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt as if I were a winner-take-all," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awarenessment month to highlight the disease.
Since closing the former troop board as a fire worker, Berni Diether has been working as a fire worker.
For nearly a decade, the former troop force stations in Munich have been shut down.
Yet, every month, lethal ammunition appears at the heart of the biosphere area of gay altitude.
The shells are sometimes so dangerous that they must be burdened on the ground.
A deafening cable hall in the explosions about the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the latest sharp shooting was on Munisin ’ s troop board, which was closed after 110 years of military operations at the end of 2005.
Since then, the 6500 hectares have been the centerpiece of the bio-sphere alb in real terms, opening 13 lines for forests and cyclists.
The fiscal burden of businessmen in Washington is rising with the Economic Recovery
Recovery means more customers, more sales, and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Government and local tax modes for domestic companies rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, a new study last week, and Washington's businesses were no exception.
District, Maryland, and Virginia companies collectively paid $27.6 billion in government and local governments in the 2013 fiscal year, up by 3.8% from the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden on companies rose by 4.3% last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% earlier this year, and it was the third year of growth in the following several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes rose faster than local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young, with the heart of government taxation, by a tax policy group.
More than half of the district ’ s tax revenue, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Maryland ’ s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia receives the smallest tax revenue from companies, at 28%.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, say the researchers, resulting in a 3.7% increase in real-estate taxes this year, following the three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1%.
While much of these gains came from large states, such as California, New York, and Texas, the process appears to be true for Washington as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid more than $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – a 4.2% increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenue, as real-estate taxes amount to less than one-fifth of corporate tax holidays.
Corporations in Virginia and D. C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, much of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D. C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real-estate taxes," Douglas Lindholm, the CEO of the Center on State Taxation, said.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other governments generate.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed only to the recovery in the real-estate market.
Business revenues also seem to be recovering, the data tell us.
Regional businesses reported $2.3 billion in income taxes on state agencies compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies is not rising at the same time in all three places.
The District rate of increase was 4.3% that of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was much higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a subpar tax revenue of 4.1%.
Virginia, at 6% in all three areas in office, has the far lower corporate income tax (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, and a relatively high 9.975% district.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires lower government and local taxes and generally a better tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9% to 6% this year, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5% next year.
If the government continues to meet its income targets next year, the legislation could reduce the rate of corporate income tax to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in Washington seem to be doing better, and thus pay more government and local taxes, the latest study argues.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that organized most small businesses - rose by 20% in the district, Maryland, and Virginia last year, to $2.4 billion, a faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and growth in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in overall VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington space could lag behind if the federal government ’ s spending cuts affect the region ’ s labor market.
Housing City: Germany ’ s Bier for Guangzhou
Hope and Malz -- a popular combination in China as well.
Germany ’ s beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Now, Frankfurt ’ s Chinese partner is wishing for bribery, and hopes for a face-to-face connection between the two cities.
Germany's Bier, brooked in Frankfurt's Guangzhou partner, is the urgent desire of Chinese officials.
"We would be pleased to see a German bride settle in our city," Li Yiwei, Deputy Party Secretary of the South China Metropolis, said in a visit to a SPD delegation this week.
Over and over again, the Chinese Communist Party ’ s official came back to the 12-millionth metropolis cause during the conversation.
Guangzhou, dubbed Kanton in Germany, was one of China ’ s richest cities, waited Li.
Thus, people would have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD Chairman Thorst Schäfer Gümble, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain, and joy," he added in the lunch with the Party top in Guangzhou.
That pleasure already strains Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
The official then joined Guangzhou with cheating - but with Red Wein, which was used to feed.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brilliance.
Tsingtao beer is brewed after Germany ’ s purity offer.
More Trades
A second wish by the Chinese hosts would be an airline connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice Party chief Li said.
The Lufthansa had earlier offered the curse, but slashed for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician was convinced.
"The commerce between our two cities continues to grow."
Right now, travelers would have to go beyond Changsha Province in Hunan, sued Li.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital, Guangzhou, is also hoping for the airline.
The province ’ s deputy governor, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäver Gubel, the Chinese deputy minister, Li Jinjun, an intimate German Kenyan, nodded agreement.
Captured Partnership
The lively Vice Party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt into a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already in the Main, but not in that function.
He came to power only this year after his predecessor was promoted on charges of corruption.
The local leader, Wan Qinglian, also had to go.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the Party and the administration that is harshly enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was a top official in Fujian, where the automobile VW was built a great work.
Frankfurt officially undertook more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection between the 9,000 kilometers away of Guangzhou is one of those cultivated by both sides, such as a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year persistence of the German-Chinese relationship was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis of the permit flow are almost as strong as they are in economic power.
Next year, it wants to achieve GDP of €250 billion, Li reported.
Joan River\ u0027s Family "Plumps
Joan Rivers has been unaware since her arrival to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her disease.
"Think of your enduring love and support," Melissa Rivers now said in a co-department.
We are all pushing the thumbs.
Their mother, according to her mother, was sent to the Mount Sinai hospital on Donor ’ s Thursday after an emergency for heart attack in a clinic at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately segregate them, until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of Donald Trump ’ s overwhelming online sport, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental Food and Rising Wages
Tighter environmental standards will be applied to cars and dams from trade today.
Like refrigerators and washing engines, on September 1, new thumbs get to a label where the buyer can see key data, such as the equipment ’ s energy efficiency.
For new cars, the pollutants' "euro 6" is greener.
There is also more money for the equipment farmers: they receive a national minimum wage of €10.25.
Amazon Buys Twitch $1.04 billion.
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday tomorrow: the online retailer and video producer, and a host of other things, is buying the video sequencing service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to take over, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if selling Twitch to Google ’ s video service was for a cool billion, and cooperation seemed natural.
Twitch, formed only three years ago when Justin.tv was a universal distribution service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players seeking to publish their birds in games, a "YouTube live for Games," he said.
The Twitch interface.
And “let ’ s play, ” a video genre in which guessers give a stir to (mostly older) games, is already popular with YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often called to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch has been welcomed, a textbook example of an established engineer who buys a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the YouTube deal failed, because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know right now is Emmet Shear, President of Twitch, saying, "We chose Amazon for believing in our community that they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who declare that they prefer to exercise rather than watch it, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes watching others in the Games rather than taking control of themselves.
It is one thing to watch a friend overlooking the shoulders at the morning, while speaking through President Evil easily, and another to watch a spinner see him sat in Call of Holly 20 times in his head.
All of these games could be seen now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego-game today, so adding can be a really good prescription for headache without control of its own.
I admit that the rapid patterns in which the roger Bannister of our electronic era ’ s electronic era graduates complete all the game are entertaining.
But, until a game or human cyberspace is involved, his Twitch-channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch is called upon by 55 million different visitors per month, and is the fourth-largest source of Internet traffic transport.
And how, exactly, does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine Twitch being integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant video as YouTube could easily have swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company wants: thousands of young men who are courted as advertisers.
As Twitch's chairman, "Amazon and Twitch said," both believe in the future of the gaming, "and the medium shows no sign of contraction, not even, as a viewer.
On the hill at the burqing plant, a lot was nowhere on Sunday ’ s table.
The concept of hereditary age voted.
Despite the vigorous rainy committee on Saturday on Saturday, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the burggling fest.
At times, the reception needed to be stopped.
"That was angry," Ron Sem, one of the organizers, said.
Salzwel ’ s light and fun.
In two Spanish words, Maxim Sakraj and Ron Sem formed the name.
For, on the day and evening, the victims of Air in the salt veteran burgland are intended to radiate brightness through shows.
Na, and fun is no alone anyway.
This was already apparent at the early Sunday, when the first visitors opened themselves to the victims of Air.
A test for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they have.
Around the supply scene on the Burggarwiese, salesmen had salt veterans, as well as guests from their proximity to the wider environment.
They pursued the first live occurrences, sprouting in the act, enjoyed coolly drinks - short: relaxation and pleasure were requested.
And it is generational.
Whereas one ceiling on the extra ceiling of white sand was listening to the arable, others bogged down at a quarter of the Vinothek, the descendants raged on the hip, a big rallying point for the smaller guests.
But, even with child mines, voluntary aid workers literally had to do all hands to master the urge and wipe imaginative creations into the small faces.
The Greater used the Kickertic, or participated in a skat-boy workshop that the Goodfoot-crew of Salzwedded.
Until the big rains came.
Shortly before 17.30 watch, he boasted of the newcomers, especially families searched the white and dry.
But the appeal of the fortress did not stop there.
"More people came than expected," Ron Sem said, "which spoke of" success on all counts. "
So there is nothing wrong with a repeat of the big party next year.
Whatever the substance and size of the event, on Sunday ’ s first record, he made clear to the popular vote.
He was angry that the time of the reception had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm had been counted with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid no longer came in the stock.
The resonance was very good.
In an initial conservative estimate, the salt veteran Mitorganizers spoke of about 1,200 visitors who walked in the burggers.
The problems were with tone technologies.
The salt veterans Hip-Hop-Band Blocks ``ninaugurated Rox.''
Technology has been unable to create a semi-reasonable sounds.
The proposed Shiak Lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to salt sun because of a rice panel.
"Next year, they will be here," he said.
The premiums of the Amula-Open-Air were more than accomplished by the visitors.
And it is in bad weather.
But the old have made some mistakes that will be withdrawn for the first time, but that must be eliminated at the second edition.
The social networks of Facebook also need to attract criticism from the heretics.
"Sorry but twelve euros have simply been expected to do more," Melanie Meier speaks at the stage of events.
"You, alas, have some takeover," Ele Zimmermann says in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as narrow.
I find it very good that some are not only stupid, but are really trying to put something on their feet as well.
Well! "Stephanie writes yes to the amula.
Now the events remain a year to stop these criticisms.
The New Radome in Berline: Waterberg ’ s Truth Shrinking
This is not as expected.
Instead, the ready construction part waits to be used in the marketed construction plant.
The move is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA space watchdog, the dustbin, the so-called Radome, is being totally restored.
The new Radome will be a little smaller than the old one with a measurement of 47.5 meters.
But size remains the world record.
The final step in completing the new shell is the exchange of scarcity.
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and taken down with a beach.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new shells will be raised.
As long as the weather plays, the move should take place at the beginning of this week.
Part of the Ice Bucket Challenge is Bringing Up
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom shot so much when their iron water was shot over its head that it injured its face ’ s bone structure.
The Ice Bucket challenge was sorely misguided.
A woman was sent to the hospital after slashing so much at the Ice Bucket challenge that she blew himself up.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom took so much action when her iron water was wrapped above its head that she violated her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I shall, and, while I'm not speaking, my goose was easy," she told The Mirror.
Iron water is buried over 20 years.
Islam ’ s Roberts Some Seconds Before the accident
I wanted to shut down my mouth, but that was not what the Kiefer was hasty, and I then understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this, almost taking my revenge into the chickens, but I had to get into the emergency room.
British 20-year-olds were brought to the hospital to return home after participating in the viral trend in Tuesday.
The clip has been reduced to Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the burgers soon return to one stone?
Finally, there has been time and again between the two skyscrapers of Burgclub.
Now the boards are considering the possibility of cooperation.
The late Richard Dimbath, a former chairman of the WolWolWolf Burgfreer, led the project in the French guédelon, as a model for rebuilding the WolWolWolWolf River.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the burgland club and the Burgfreeans of Wolf ’ s thaw.
Exceptionally different thus far has seemed to be the case of how to deal with the history of the Wolf ’ s Burg and possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving together: talks about collective action should soon be held.
This confirms the leaders of Sjöberg (Burgtonians) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriend) confirm our paper ’ s demand.
"I have called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down again," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could return to one stone in the future.
So, too, are visible successes.
Whereas the Burgfreshness about the late Richard Dimbath, until recently, saw the Burg on the mountain forest rebuilding, the ``development and contract of money is at the forefront for the Burgert around Sjöberg.'
Herbert Piffl, the chairman of the Burgfriend, has pleased his own calls.
Since Dimbbon ’ s death, he has been on the sidelines.
A new chair is to be found in a member assembly in mid-September.
The club, according to 74 years of age, now counts some 40 members.
"After my friend Richard Dimbath's death, we first let the uniformity of respect rest," a "which was needed to" consider how it could go further. "
According to Piffl, the new chair will go into talks with the burgers.
Until then, the Burgyans may also have a recent mood picture within their groupings.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, Piffl says.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself," he himself does not want to run because he has his apartment in Bad Twelz.
The new chair should be a wolf ’ s wild card.
The twelzer wants to "work much further."
The different points of reconstruction are likely to prevail in the eyes of Piffles anytime soon.
He accuses Dimbath of being a "missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the burg.
Two similar projects in Austria and France, already well advanced, would show that this idea is not a pilot.
They are a tourist magnet through high turnout and voluntary aid flows from around the world.
Piffle: "I, too, was skeptical at the beginning.
But, over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project, "creating a" single manufacturing feature "for the flood town.
There is nothing else.
Moreover, Piffl believes that the project could be financed by EU grants, visitors Tickets, and potential sponsors.
"I don't personally want to overturn the idea of rebuilding," he hopes that the burgland club may be moving on that point.
Their aim of documenting history first is "important and good."
After that, one could look forward.
Smart Pay to Save Uni-Teachers
Since the cost of universal textbooks is more than $1,000 a year for many students, the fast-two student Matt Sroeder was considered a clever austerity ideal.
He invented a box system for books by students of higher semesters and offered nominal compensation to delay sales.
"My mathematical book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-movie keks," said Schroeder 19 who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
College management told students, on average, to spend more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and student materials, but there were different cost-cutting options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as roeders are increasingly the solution to the election for students.
Cleaning textbooks becomes more popular, so students can use a book long for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, has said that the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Industrial surveys show that about a quarter of the books were mixed in college bookstores last spring, Neebos Vice President Team Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought, according to the National Association of College Stores, in Campus-Book Polls.
Here the single one is for the best deal.
Buying Online
Some new books cost online only one-third of the price they have in the campus bookstores.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be devoted to specialized textbook traders Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buys Need
If the notes of other or normal users are not, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25 "Final Studies at Brigham Young University," says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com, 42 Cents on a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End To Advertising Business Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students should ask their professors whether past spending was permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to seminary work.
In such cases, older spending often can be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Except for Chegg and Amazon, Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books.
Mirror
The mold of textbooks is worth considering when you treat them reasonably well, think about giving them back, and don ’ t want to keep the books after completing the course.
They can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
A student, for example, could "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Informing on the provisions of the deal with you, including the punitive fees that might be applied to writing notes, subterfuges, or passports.
Were it right: if you don ’ t give up the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books, too, are an option, not conventional textbooks.
Sometimes these books are de facto filled with an electronic license for a specific period of major traders like Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc....
At Chegg, one can name "Calculus" for 6 months at around $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, because many classics today can be downloaded free of charge, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Certainly, they look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends that the ISBN number be priced in books, because it is safe to find the right textbook.
And, prior to an online punishment, Gault argues, the book is indeed preventive.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery, and eventually paid the full price in college bookstores.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Not became Cassailers
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvested Stallon played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "A Dame to Kill For" played only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape," spurred by Cameron, played a mere $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while movies like "dragon counts make it easy to 2" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by the telegrapher Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality of the films may be the reason for the film itself.
Collin described in 2014 as “the worst year ” for child films, describing“ dragon counts easily made 2 "simply" functional "fantasy sequencing.
But in films for a slightly older target group, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average Cinemacore and Metacritic evaluation for every summer ’ s film start, reflected in leaps between America ’ s Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and this year ’ s, to at least 2000.
The results rely on the opinion of movie makers and film critics, suggesting that this year ’ s film hits are the same as those of last year.
Some commentators argue that what is happening is due to changing living habits and the growing popularity of Web Street services such as Netflix.
Regisur Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's forthcoming Jungles movie, said to the Hollywood reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We need to accept this, not try to do so in the past.
In contrast to Hollywood ’ s recent poor cash shows, net sales of $1.2 billion recently reached nearly twice last year, when sales were $837 million.
Last summer, the director Steven Gamberg criticized the film study for focusing too much on films of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its gloomy prophecy may well contain a real core.
But, owing to the potential cutters expected to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions, and Jurassic World, other food-industry officials are more optimistic:
The X-Men producer, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in casualties as simple "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporters: "Next summer will be the largest summer at all, and nobody will worry about business anymore."
This has been a step in the right direction several years ago, when the 2. Tibetan district class was eliminated at the cost of tightening Ligen-sharing.
The German tissue has now entered the program an additional 33th Bundesleum.
As a result, those who have not risen have risen up.
For example, while Götting ’ s classic highest team, Torpedo, has avoided the decline in the upper Lega Relation, it is playing only five-rate in the upcoming season.
Fourth-rate Torpedo ’ s seeds, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo died in the suburbs, as did the SC ’ s boys.
The SG Lengers and the Torpedo Reserve are entering the new organization league tables in which the national league is no longer representing Göttinger clubs.
In the lady, TTV is playing Geismar in the governing league, the Torpedo branch in the national league.
What the composition looks like a better circuit clause is now the new district cobus southern.
Here, TSV sailors, VFB lions, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, laptop holes, the FC ’ s character, and the TTC.
In the township league, Dransfeld and the SC Weende play in regional representatives, TTC II circuses, Rot White, Bovender SV II, and TTV Geismar II ’ s team and III ’ s team. The seed ’ s district soberia, at least, begins in strength.
Günters, TTTC, and TTV Geismar II are all in the game.
In the county league, Torpedo III and Sdarhausen/would-be marches are underway.
With Nine Teams
The SC is sending its girl to the small county league.
Nor is the SCC boys' circular staffs -- where Torpedo II is still underway -- complete.
In a circuit class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende, and the SV ’ s bovenders are headed for the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, Göttinger Kreigned with nine teams.
In the West staffle, Rot-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV, and V, MTV Grone, the SC II Drance-field field field, Mield hauls, and SG Lengers II.
In the East Staffle, among other things, the sick sands/would-be marches, Nikolausberg and the Flemish play.
The Damand Kreisa League consists of Snow hauls/Wöllmarshausen II, images, inhibitors, sailors, Tuspo Weende, and the SG Rhume.
That is still better than in the circle of Eastode, where there are no dam teams at all.
Conspicuously, none of the 6. Circuit classes will be able to worry again.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On weekend, there were protests by opponents at the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport as an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, some 150 people gathered in Cardiff to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen ’ s Fairclough has pushed us into Belgium for the weekend, talking to protesters traveling to Bridgend.
Extinct Teenagers from the Blue Mountain
ZWEI youthful bugs were made safe after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man briefly blew up their way after Sunday in Govett ’ s Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives wrote the police at around 20 a.m., when the two had not returned home.
An addictive rupture from local police and rescue services collapsed, and the couple was found at around 23 p.m. near Bridal Veil.
The girl had never been injured, and the man was overthrown and his head turned.
Bailouts stayed with the couple overnight, and were extinct tomorrow on Monday.
They were delivered to a stable state with a hospital car to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating the Government ’ s Protests in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 protesters have been forced out of the PTV building, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The station, after well over half an hour, has resumed radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq has said that the demonstrators who were equipped with pieces have damaged rumors in the edition.
Deaths or injuries were not reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the government to which they accuse electoral fraud.
The police said that roughly a kilometer of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence had come back to clashes with security forces on Monday.
A policeman was injured after hospital coverage.
By the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured as demonstrators tried to penetrate Sharif ’ s residence.
They demand the prime minister ’ s resignation.
The powerful military had called on Sunday after a meeting at the army headquarters for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using force."
"The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
Escalating violence has fueled concerns about military intervention in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and Presidential Tahirul Qadri have lasted since August 14 th the Independence Day.
Sharif rejects resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on Sunday to stay out.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri made similar statements.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning last May ’ s parliamentary election by cheating.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 ,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government ’ s neighborhood.
The protesters initially balked peacefully in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on weekend for Sharif ’ s residence.
Hashing villages, after their second season victory, have three tablets.
With 2: 0 above the size, a bitter week on Sunday ended conciliatory for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had obtained a wishful head on the European League on Donbas Day.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torprotector Steffen Hofmann, who was ranked 3rd by green whites.
Srammel trauma has put Rapid on the road to victory with the second season victory in a proper response to the disappointment with Helsinki, and goes to the country ’ s game with an experience of success.
"We wanted a positive reaction," said Foreign Defense Thomas Schrammel, who, with his mastermind, took the sixteenth anniversary of the 14 minute, set the stage for victory.
"I thought I was purely and quickly smiling the entire fruit of Donbas," said the 26-year-old.
That was true of Ried, for the last time yet, on November 13, 2010, when it had hit a federal treasury.
Thus, the first Rapid Dress championship will be a special reminder.
"This is something very special for me; I am from the paper pool," said Schumel.
Mario Pavelic ’ s short-term Becken-blessinr turned a rampage from the left to the right defensive, making his case very good.
He has enough experience to reflect his position.
He deserved to have the goal, he has already provided some assists this year, "praised Barisic.
Manufacture also provided the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann after well over one hour that eventually brought the decision.
After all, the guests could well have filed.
"Thanks to God, we have had some lucky now," we also observed fraudulently, pointing to the clash between performance and results in recent weeks: "The results have not been true, but the player was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games had been better than today" -- the strongest team ever played in this season. "
The first trifecta since July 26 thus proved that the team ’ s structure was intact to setbacks, despite "Today, my team has shown that it has character."
For him, "We have finally played to zero again."
Much work during country recess is also likely to lament several defaults with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar, and Michael Schimpelsberger, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philip Schobesberger, have made victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget this," Barisic, who has lost his funeral and Pavelic games over the past three days, "has lately been very stable."
So the country's game game must be used to "lease wounds and put a little in the physical realm" Barisic, who has five U21 selection camps in his ranks.
One who may want the pause most is Chapter Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, cares about pain.
It was at this heavy stage that he showed that he is a very important player, "concerted Barisic.
Hobmann not only provided the structure, but also hit the second gate before he was replaced.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350 Federal Game, it was the first meeting since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 over the Admira).
Hubris: "Droughts don't believe that everything is good now" we have certainly had some luck, but eventually happiness must come back to us.
Now it was high time, "Hofmann said.
He was, however, too focused to work: "You can not always see it black and white.
We have not played as badly as we have seen in recent weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help at the very moment.
That is true of me in certain phases, "said Hofmann.
Greater coach Michael Baur had little to blame for his team.
He regretfully regretted the quick opposite "from the magic category," as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40 minutes disregarded by referee colleagues.
The only charge that I can make of the team is that in some phases we have not been sufficiently specific.
We have had too little conclusions.
Internal defenders of Maxian Karner saw it the same way: "It did poorly, but then we found ourselves purely and even made a goal.
By and large, it would have been more.
The Ruh Rides
We showed a powerful tribe in our summer summer series' my piece of beautiful happiness "on past Friday.
Several of these cotton giants still exist in the countryside, the designated specimens are "hostage heat" above the doorstep.
A bumpy path of footprint goes back to the roughly 600 years of old ears.
There is no end in the clock, baseline shopping, and baseline messenger.
A piece below the stone collapse from the building sberg, a kilometer north of the road to wheat, because it is at.
Vital looks like natural monuments, it looks good beyond the other trees of the environment, and recalls an American mammalian tree with more than eight meters.
A small boddha in a construction pump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intensive research, there were only hints of name-reason.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has used the extra handshake of Archiv, asking older people from the underground beard to learn what custom it has to do with hostage cries.
The outcome of his investigations was a rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, brick brains are said to have driven their animals from underground bridges to the onerous, freed by stones.
On the tree ’ s wall, the animal herdsmen exhausted by rise are said to have taken root.
Now the field has regained its importance, because the Vienna are actually reproducing goats.
The field has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve system, and has continued to find vagaries.
But they should be cautious about the concrete of the stone collections, because the Basel Again from the sun is also a popular residence site for crusaders.
A migrant route leads from underground bridge to the tree, but it does hide something.
Further paths have been reported, jumped to high levels, and invited widespread migration.

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy ’ s prime minister and acting EU leader, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his secretary of state, Federica Mogherini, as chief of EU foreign policy, despite strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s EU summit, succeeding British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, sebagaimana dilakukan oleh pemerintah La Republica, menunjukkan pemerintah, menunjukkan pemerintah untuk meningkatkan pemerintah Pemerintah Mogherini sebagai para pemimpin yang terhadap pemerintah di Uni Eropa.
He also expects a boost to his "reform" package in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the left-wing party base that he faces, which Mogherini is assigned - albeit more moderately - to.
Conservative officials with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, nominated as Council President, Donald Tusk, hold the predominant view in Rome to balance policy.
For EU Commission President Juncker ’ s chief diplomacy is simultaneously becoming a proxy.
The upcoming approval of the EU Parliament is seen as safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 415-year-old Democratic Party (PD) leader a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica's widespread optimism is that party offices have been proven for almost two decades, and that Mogherini, known for her ambition, will face up to the "huge challenges."
The native beast is married and has two daughters.
Their party careers began the promoted political scientist 1996 Youth Organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (leftist Democrats), which met with the Catholic centrist Margherita party in 2008 as today ’ s Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election of the Left Democrats ’ Party Council, she entered high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, which she chaired soon became.
It occupied traditional Italian foreign policy emphasis, such as the Middle East, was known by studies of NATO ’ s use in Afghanistan involving Italy with a troop contingent, and by contacts with America ’ s social democrats and Democrats.
Since 2008, it has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, which is an expert on defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he advised Mogherini as Secretary of State.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace-building movement, which contributed more than 40% to the party ’ s vote in the EU elections in May, then, as is noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini did.
So the caveats in Brussels, which new EU foreign officials have too little diplomatic experience, are lacking substance, are held in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly Poland and the Baltic members, the mightily realistic accents of Mogherini are being pursued for the crisis in Ukraine and disseminated as a "pro-Russia course."
It advocates the South Stream pipeline, run by Russia ’ s gas company, to bring Russia ’ s natural gas directly to southern Europe by bypassing Ukraine, which also serves Italy ’ s energy security.
After running for office as EU leader in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photographs that they showed with Putin at the Shaking-winning plant were met in Brussels with outrage, as was inviting the Kremlin ’ s leader to attend the October meeting of the country ’ s economy.
Overall nine young people have started their training in Nabburg on Monday.
Here is an Azubi who has already completed another education in the company.
In four education records, the new staff will work in the future: electronics (three trained), Mechatronists (two), toolkit mechanics (two), and procedural mechanics (two).
All sides come from the countryside of gag: Tobias Braun and Thomas BBoerl from Black Air, Stefan Brickens, and Florian Rewitzers from Schmidgades, John Beer of Neunburg, Felix Domaier from Colonel Vultach, Daniel Sorgenfree, and Sebastian from Pliberty and Ferdind Streinand Teunz.
The new educated previously visited primary, middle-school, and real education.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trained people of all the millennials, as well as educators, travel to Columnium Day to a teaming season, which includes, among other things, a full-time immigration and rehabilitation on the internal agenda.
The company counts 435 and 950 workers worldwide.
The out-of-pocket figure is 27 over all the millennials.
The Socialists in France were supposed to "keep silent and keep France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial Socialist president whose cabinet education has been met with disapproval by the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone ’ s respect; he deserves our loyalty; he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at great applause.
As an important gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France ’ s controversial 35-hour week, despite strong calls for a relaxation of the rule of Emmanuel Macrons, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his Socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the minister of justice, dispatched a recipe when she attended a meeting of renegade Socialist MPs, criticizing the Socialist Party for "taking the French faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader on the National Front, derided the continuing infighting of the Socialists, saying that she could not imagine that the new Valls government will hold up for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without a clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no force to form a new government when the old one doesn ’ t survive even a summer.
"The new one, too, will not survive the fall or winter," said Le Pen to support.
She repeated her party ’ s call for parliamentary dissolution, saying that she was confident that she would emerge as a winner in early elections, and was prepared for government.
France ’ s ruling party was defeated in its municipal elections in March, and the right-wing National Front led the way in the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday journal du Disome found that 76% of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande ’ s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, has warned that if the new socialist government fails to pay for the economy and records, the French would quickly lose patience.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must feel fast that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.

pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the vote.
A peinguished group went near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the National People ’ s Congress (NPC) committee enacted a framework law that allows only two or three candidates to run Hong Kong ’ s leadership elections in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain majority support from a nominating committee, which is likely to be packed with peer members.
That decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, leading pro-democracy activists to maintain their threat and slash the financial square with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and Chinese leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After publishing a Beijing White Paper that laid out China ’ s hegemony over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city ’ s headquarters and organized a woman.
Li ’ s survey is organized by Hong Kong ’ s government and Hong Kong ’ s China ’ s links agency.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the deputy director of the Office of Hong Kong Affairs and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be asked over the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in Hong Kong on afternoon to serve the office of leaders.
Britain did not envisage any democratic elements until the end of Hong Kong ’ s 150-year colonial government.
Putin demands that Kiev resume "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, Russian media reports demand that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east and begin negotiating directly for the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist territory of eastern Ukraine is part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine must be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.
But Putin ’ s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian insurgents seems to have met his strategy since the riots began five months ago: help the separatists take over territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to become de facto independent of an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with Canada ’ s state television station, Putin denounced Ukraine ’ s military campaign to regain the separatist-held territory in Donetsk and Luhansk, the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the territory "Novorossiya" or "New Russia," a term reminiscent of Russia's pre-revolutionary glaciers.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope to "be trapped in their illusions" during the 26 th election campaigns of Ukrainian politicians.
"We need to engage immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization and state status of southeast Ukraine to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which the Kiev leadership has discussed for months to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only Ukraine ’ s government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin's clarion to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to direct Crimea, which is a majority of the two million inhabitants of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing eastern Ukraine ’ s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, because most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and pre-conflict surveys have provided a wide majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy promoted by Russian diplomats in international forums would give Ukraine ’ s regional governments the authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thereby giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russia ’ s territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to most of Russia ’ s navy, as well as a major trading port and historic coast region.
Moreover, regions between the Red Territory in Russia and Crimea are rich in mines, factories, and gas vessels that create important components for the Russian military.
In his June 7 inaugural speech, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukraine's legislation should consider - after fresh elections - amendments to the constitution granting its territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels accused of arming and inflaming Moscow.
Putin ’ s last call for Kiev to negotiate evenly with separatist leaders came after another campaign by the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks penetrated the formerly peaceful region along the Azeri Sea into eastern Ukraine.
The Russian-backed separatists handpicked Novoasowsk, who, according to fears from Ukrainian security officials, was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coast region by Crimea.
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have been used to consolidate Mariupol, a steel industrial port of 500,000 inhabitants between Novoowsk and the Crimea Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a Saturday meeting of the EU ’ s leaders in Brussels, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the eve of a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine ’ s territory.
The EU summit did not take concrete action; its leaders demanded that additional sanctions be imposed on Russia, which would enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers injected into the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council speaker Reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
The first, probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers completed by Russia ’ s incursion into Ilowajsk, were replaced on Sunday for 10 Russian parachutes captured a week ago in Ukrainian territory, divided Lysenko on Sunday.
Nackfotographer scandal surrounding Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelists did not heed his anger at hackers, who presumably stolen names from his prayers, Gabi Grecko, and Who is Who who stolen from Hollywood for the A-Promis.
The movie city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Yennifer Lawrence in a hacking scandal for Internet celebrities.
The responsible hacker may have 60 nackfotos from Lawrence, "the tribute of Panem," and of superstars, including the model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michellen, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky, and Grecko of Melbourne, private photographs were reported to have been publicized by an iCloud gap.
The list includes 101 celebrities.
"It is defiant."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reportedly told a news website that the shame was "shameful" and that those involved felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is up without a pool.
Palmers's films include "love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Star Strahovsky, and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on battered images.
As one Lawrence said to the TMZ, "It is an abominable violation of privacy."
Seth Rogen, an actor, condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Saked images from a cell phone are nothing different from selling chickens."
In purely legal terms, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger, and Watch were at the 8th wheel in the Great fields, thereby supporting "help for cancer sick children."
The tour that was one ordeal for one another was easy training.
But everyone agreed on one thing: it did fun.
Thomas Studanski may have sleeped well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief executive of the upper house has yesterday walked the wheel on the mountain.
For the good ends.
He can easily take away the small muscle father, given that he had also personally brought him a valuable insight into him at the 8 th wheels on the Great Road in favor of the United States for "help for cancer children" (Frankfurt).
A good thing.
"I now know I can -- prima!"
Small Polls in the applause curve?
Nee, if I had stopped, who was...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is in the upper echelon for the CDU, many of the 718 subjects yesterday quered to mountains and came close to exhaustion but happily on the plateau.
Others, by contrast, found it easier to transcend the 11 kilometers long between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Directors, for example.
The Red Green Politician of three days -- red dress, red bike -- made the start of an understatement ("Every amount of profit, since it is a target!"), then turned out to be a half-profit on the mountain, reaching 45 minutes without respiratory.
He, too, has gone through the rubble, as has Nina Kuhn, a press secretary in the city of Colonel, who, together with Frank, had walked through greenbacks.
For the two triathletes, the "field berg-radar" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Charity is involved, because we are happy to go away - we would have done it anyway," Kuhn says.
They then met Paul Wenzel at Colonel Day.
The boy (12) was drifted to the surface the morning, to tighten again.
On the morning, Frankfurt Florian Zierz had "swooped up" at home twice, "twice, to rejoice at home.
It did have "Fritton Toni."
For the CEO of the Colonel Cultkiosks, raadtours over the field are simply part of it.
He had rushed 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo-rad race.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I like to be here, "said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says that he is an "ambitious renal trader."
He must be, for he was on the way to the "Fixie-Rad," but without shambles...
The fact that even without Rad loose, not only did the 20 other walls who rose above the White Wall and the merchant at the summit, but also a jogger who left behind a cargo in a basket of weights.
"I know" from Frankfurt, who trained for a special umbrella, only that he himself was suffering. "So the man is his own grab.
The 718 participants - and thus so many as never before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
Watches first at 9.30.
It was followed by the first cyclists and buyers at 10 a.m..
Five minutes later, the first mobile bidders laid bare.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the United Nations "Radlen on the Great Feldberg," gave the star squads and wished the participants a beautiful foray.
Next year, he hopes that the bomb to the mountain will be able to block the participants ’ security.

Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is hardly friendly .
They wanted to talk about implementation of the international agreement , as well as about Tehran ’ s destabilizing actions in the Middle East .
But the encounter is also intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution .
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington criticizes continued settlement of Israel , and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process .
The Obama deal on Iran ’ s nuclear program has further worsened the relationship .
In March , Netanyahu gave a controversial speech , sometimes viewed as an affront to Obama , at the invitation of Republicans to the US Congress .
The speech was not with Obama ; a meeting had rejected him by pointing to Israel ’ s upcoming election .
In one rehearsal , a professor has shot his girlfriend .
In a rally , Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend , and that officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his " southern dog " is still empty and probably exaggerated , and he said that the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on the cell phone .
Within the house , officials found the bodies of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note crystallized on a white bloc : " I 'm so sorry to see me go , I could reverse it , I loved Amy , and she is the only woman I ever loved , " according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who trained in two online courses for Delta State University at Cleveland , Mississississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school boards , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular historian , Ethan Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford has said that university staff have heard the shooting 10 : 18 a.m .
He said that Lamb has made the fateful note pot anytime after .
By the end of the day , there was another death : lamb died when the police encroached on it .
A day after the shootings in university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an image of what motivated Lamb .
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state , as did what students and employees knew it , helped to paint an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
Students said they were delighted in his teaching .
The police in Gauler , where Prentiss died , said that he had no history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote mentioning the " miraculous people " with which he shared his academic life .
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , with 17 members of the teacher , and many students attended courses from both .
At the same time , there was some inclination to be problematic in behavior .
One student , Brandon Beaver , praised by Lamb , said that he also seemed somewhat excited and nervous , " as if something was wrong with him . "
Another student , Micle Syke , said that Lamm told him that he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to switch for health reasons , telling that he had any health problem .
This year , he taught only two online courses .
Recent changes in the University ’ s employment policy meant that the Promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee him an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor .
University President William Lage Forge said he didn ' t know of a Lamb conflict with Schmidt , but " there was , of course , something in Mr Lamb 's idea . "
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
After fleeing the Campus , the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Missississippi from Arkansas .
Before he was arrested , Lamb killed himself with a 3,38 Caliber Pistole in a house ’ s backyard , say , a mile south of his parents ’ house on Greville City Lamb Mississippi , said Washington County Coron Methel Johnson .
His car was still in the making .
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to the house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009 , which has 3,500 students in a city with roughly 12,000 people and trained geography and pedagogics .
It was trained in pedagogics in the spring of this year .
One of Lamb ’ s longtime friends described him as intelligent , charismatic , and final .
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 , and that Lamm was 20 when she met through common friends .
They and their friends were at high school , and he was the cool of older Kerl , who tried for several years to bring their gambler to the game .
He was the black .
All girls melting away when he was there , " said Hairston , now 40 , and in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon .
Obviously , Lamb and Prentiss were some time together .
In the Notruf , Lamb said , " I killed my wife , " but there was no forum for marriage .
They had a dog named Lightning , who lived with them in the Backstone House , adjacent to a Bayou in Gauck .
The police said that the dog was right .
The ex-husband of Prentiss , Shawn O ’ Steen , said that they were abandoned 15 years ago , but that friends had stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
" She was totally devastated on the ground , " said O ’ Steen about his daughter .
They and their mother were absolutely best friends .
O ’ Steen said he never met Lamb , but his daughter , Abigail , told him that Lamb was interested in music and that Blues played Blues .
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both entered a summer ’ s millennium three years ago .
Later , they played together one or another greed .
O ’ Steen said that his daughter writes and sinks her own music .
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for different companies .
Mike Shaffer , a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room , a thinly insulated bar near Gautier , said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in September 5 , the last time that Lamb finished his Gitarren and Mundharmonious Caspiel at the night .
There was no sign that anything was wrong with anything .
" Simply a happy couple , " he said .
We were cleaning up and saddled .
I think both had a good sense of shell .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first-seminary program and specialized in American indigenous Americans and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas , and was President of his Brotherhood and of the student committee .
On the Tuesday Delta State Campus in Cleveland , some 900 people , including teachers , staff , students , and community members , participated in a ceremonial celebration .
Schmidt 's wife , Liz , and his brother , Jeff Schmidt , also participated in the guardian guard , while the university " Bright Morning Star " and " Amazing Grace " sang .
Education is resumed on Wednesday .
" We are trying to get our students to return , " said Lage Forge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
The Associated Press author Emily Wagster Pettus in Greville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans helped bring this report .
This story was revised to reflect that the police now say that Lamb did so after shooting Schmidt , and that , while Lamm called his wife his note , there is no indication that the two had ever married .
Toy ’ s R & D plan to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R & amp ; D says that not as many Christmas season workers will hire as they did last year , but that the toys and baby producers say that they will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers across the country , while 45,000 workers were hired in the Christmas period 2014 .
Most jobs will be part-time jobs .
The company said that it will start talking about the application talks this month , and that the number of workers will rise from October to December .
While the holiday itself is a few months away , the Christmas business is moving closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide shops to workers who sell , send , and sell products .

The UN ’ s Leader says No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has said that his response to Russia 's increased military support for Syria is that " there is no military solution " to nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people .
The UN head again calls for all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to reach a political solution .
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the Council 's five permanent member states -- the US , Russia , China , the United Kingdom , and France -- on the verge of this month 's ministerial meeting with the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers " make this situation intractable . "
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the Syrian crisis that they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surveys that show Donald Trump taking seriously .
Some have tried to brand it as a flop .
Others dismissed him as a joke .
And some are awaiting collapse .
But , however some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top in polling polls , it has not ( yet ) worked .
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump at double-digit rates , and some are beginning to wonder seriously what it means for their nomination to be .
Of course , it is still too early in the electoral term .
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
Experts stress that by 2011 Rick Perry ’ s leadership was abandoned to the rising Herman Cain , none of whom won even one state in the nominating process .
And there are many reasons to fight in a general election .
But outsiders like Jeb Bush ’ s Super PAC and the conservative Club for Growth now recognize Trump ’ s persistence and start flowing into dollars to topple it .
Here are some recent surveys that suggest that the real-estate fashion is not just a temporary phase :
Trump ’ s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June , a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans considered the real-estate mogul positive .
By mid-July , it was 40 % .
In early August , it was 52 % .
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump .
Some three out of ten say they have negative views .
And these figures are in early states .
A Quinnipiff vote in Iowa last week found that 60 % of Republicans hold a good view of Trump .
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates .
In a poll of CNN / ORC last week , 67 % of Republicans said that they were either " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if Trump were nominated .
Only two out of 10 say that they would be " angry " if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump ( 43 % say they are " enthusiastic " 40 % who say the same thing about Trump ) .
The Next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rubio , with only 21 % .
On the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they would be " unhappy " or " angry if Jeb Bush , the establishment favorite , were the candidate .
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump ’ s temperament as a problem .
Whereas Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements , 52 % of Irish voters leaning toward Republicans believe that the real-estate fashion has the right template for a president , ABC News / Washington Post said on Monday .
The same figure is true in the nation ’ s first pre-election state , Iowa , where the same 52 % of Republicans think he has personality for a chief commander , according to Quinnipiac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 % think that he does not have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post says .
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea .
When they set their scholars , Republican voters think Trump is real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , CNN / ORC surveys last week say four out of ten that Trump is the best bet .
This has changed since the end of July , when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush .
Full disclosure : GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past .
At that point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination from just 28 % for the final candidate , Mitt Romney .
Nonetheless , a variety of GOP voters are now seeing Trump ’ s campaign as plausible .
Even when Republicans gather for another candidate , Trump beats almost everyone .
Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely to contribute to Trump ’ s leadership , while the anti-trust sport is diffused on more than a dozen other candidates .
But a survey by Monmouth University early September shows that in a hypothetical race between Trump and most other Republican candidates , Trump receives majority support .
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina , ahead of Marco Rubio 14 , 15 points before Walker , 19 points before Jeb Bush , and , eventually , Rand Paul , John Kakonn , and Christie 33 points .
It is a close race with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate to beat him ?
Ben Carson would easily surpass the entrepreneurial on 19 points in a hypothetical race .
A narrow majority of Donald-Trump fans say they have formed their minds .
A new survey by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have kept their votes firmly .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one really can say that they will never change opinion .
46 % said that they made the door open to other candidates .
Yet Trump ’ s strongest competition is now that of other outsiders , Ben Carson ’ s neurosurgeon , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as frequently for Trump .
Six out of 10 Republicans say they coincide with Trump on immigration .
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico " rapists " in his campaign two months ago , immigration has been the linchpin of public discourse in 2016 .
Some worry that Trump ’ s bombastic phrase will keep critical Hispanio Americans away from the Republican Party , damaging the rebalancing effort .
But , following the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republicans say that they are consistent with Trump on immigration issues .
So long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Trump seems to be doing it .
Frustration with the government climbs to new highs .
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of Republican voters ’ support , particularly their outsider status .
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the ABC / Post Monday poll , they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience .
And they are angry at Washington .
A survey by Des Moines Regiines / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Congressional Republicans , with 54 % " dissatisfied " and 21 % " woefully angry . "
Munich , Syke , and Co. : The five most exclusive German housing areas .
Here in the hoboat route , the most expensive apartment is - looking at the North Sea watching .
In the street , a square meter of a resident house costs an average of € 73,300 .
" In the Syrians , the offer of objects is naturally limited , " it is said in the study - that is , the high price .
A new study shows how special burdens cost a square meter the most .
Of course , € 18.70 per square meter for a Munich student bust is not really little .
But , unlike Germany ’ s top residences , the price is like Peanuts .
The real-estate service , Engel & Nations , has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites , with square meters at dizzying heights .
There are several thousand euros nix - per square meter , well measured .
But who can afford ...
Besides , for once , Munich is not at the top .
The Champions League : Bayerners ’ Dream Starting Through Mumbers and Mumbers
Two peers in Piraeus : Bavaria star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
A fortunate meeting of Thomas Müller paved the FC Bavaria the way to an earned 3 : 0 at the Olympics Piraeus - then went .
A sovereign spectacle of the Champions-League season .
World Mayors Thomas Müller and Mario Goling provided the FC with a dream start in the " mission of Milan . "
The Trainer Pep Guardiola team won its play at the Champion League ’ s record Olympics in the hot atmosphere thanks to Mdel ’ s dupack ( 52 / 90 + 2 ) and idle ( 89 ) deserved to 3 / 0 / 0 .
The 12th anniversary of the series is said to be the first step towards Final on May 28 , 2016 , where Guardia , at last , is seeking to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third round .
At its 28th meeting at the Champion League , Mr. Roberto received a beneficial help from the Olympic Torture Roberto , who created a flank shot from the world champion .
" We will not underestimate them , " had promised Bavaria ’ s Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm before the Karaiskakis-Stadim match 31,688 hot fans – and kept the Munich speaking .
They showed a focused and committed notion without shining .
Pireus had won his recent six rallies in the royal class , including named clubs like Manchester United , Atlético Madrid , or Juventus Turin .
In 2011 , Borussia stumbled the village ( 1 : 3 ) .
But the Bavarians , unsealed in seven Europhop duals with Greek teams , did not want to be the next casualty .
They went boldly , but often too ingeniously in their offensive efforts .
Too often , the attacks were initiated by a shift to the left , Douglas Costa , who was seldom seen against the former brown Omar Elablaoui .
More fortunate from the right than his flank from the right cut in the far left .
At 67 minute , the World Cup gave the possible 2 : 0 .
The best opportunities in half were Robert Lewandowski .
First , when the Olympic storm of Ideye Brown beat the Polish headscarf ( 26 ) .
Then , by direct decline , the Torwart Roberto parked with the knee ( 35 ) .
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game , Piraeus Nadelstigated .
But at the umbrella of Manuel New , it was a relic .
For example , when he floated ideyes over the latent ( 56 ) .
More recently , Guardiola defended a four-tier group with David Alaba , at the center next to Jerome Boateng , who did it well .
Mario idoles , who were back in the cadres after muscular problems , were initially out .
The World Cup hero had given green light only after it was completed , said Matthia ’ s Sammer on “ Sky , ” when he said , “ If you want to make anything else of it , that is already vicious . ”
Guardiola also opted out when he advocated Kingsley Coman for the defeated Lewandowski ( 59 ) .
Elimination came late for Arturo Vidal ( 76 minutes ) , and , 13 minutes later , made it clear , by Elfmeter , still robberies .
Prior to the game , riots occurred in the stadium .
After a smaller group of partially mutilated Bavaria fans in their viewer bloc appears to have provoked followers of Pireus with words and gestures , the security forces took action against Munich ’ s supporters .
At least one Bavaria fan was transported from the stadium .
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke do so not only harms the lungs , but also the teeth - which suggests a Potsdam 's long-term study .
The good news : if left unchecked , risk falls fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth prematurely .
This results from an international research team ’ s long-term study , including several staff from the German Institute for Food Research ( DIfE ) in Potsdam .
Compared to non-smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely , with 2.5 to 3.6 times higher .
Scientists had watched more than 23,300 participants .
The DIfE emphasizes the main causes of default .
For these parodontis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
The link between smoking and death is thus due to more frequent smoking treatment .
No matter how much smoking might increase the risk to Cars .
People who stopped smoking may reduce their risk in a short time , but they write the journal of Dental Research .
But it may take more than a decade for the threat to return to the level of non-trachers , the former former Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham declared .
To persuade people to become non-smokers , DIfE students told Hein Boeing that " smoking shortens life . "
To avoid smoking is good for lung and prisoner , and , according to our findings , leads to good health until high age .
In Germany , toothlessness afflicted more than 20 % of the population aged 65 to 74 , the DIfE shared .
Earlier research would have already pointed out that smoking would reduce the risk of early reckoning .
The new long-term studies underpin the findings .
Archologists eat Cologne Rheinufer on Residues from Spectantic
For the repeated time being , the right Rhine Cross was made in the minds of archaeological dogs .
Near the building site for the new Rheinboulevard , archaeologists at the Roman Germanian Museum have buried skeletons and remnants of historic construction , said Museums Lord Marcus Trier at Tuesday .
Historians have been searching for so-called land monuments since the onset of construction at the Rhine .
In all construction plans in the city district , the museum is constantly added as an expert on archaeological land-mining .
In the third part of the Rheinboulevards , archaeologists became fifth .
Needless to say from textdocuments , it was already known that in the fourth century , a fortress , and a church , in the 8th century , had occurred .
In addition to rests of firing and church-tournament , a cemetery with around 350 graves had been discovered that arguably belonged to the church .

The EU Commission is Negotiating TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the proposed Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration court system .
The controversial private arbitration authority for disputes between corporations and states is thus to be replaced by a more transparent system that more traditional courts function .
" We want to create a system to which citizens trust , " the EU 's EU commissioner , Cecilia Malmfer , explained the idea .
The Swedish wants to bring the proposal into free-trade talks with the US as a European bargaining position .
The German government announced its support .
The TTIP is supposed to create the world ’ s largest free trade area , with 800 million people .
Plans to reform the current arbitration process specifically require the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They should come from the same parts of the EU , the US , and third .
A second substance is also a second term for the first time .
It would allow them to claim judgments .
So far , the procedural stakeholders have agreed with each other on referees , with no claim to their judgments .
In the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system on fairness and justice , and compromised malaria flows .
In the long run , it wants to work , on its own terms , to establish an International Investment Court .
There , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be settled .
The investor-state arbitration procedures ( ISDS ) that were demanded , particularly by large corporations , are viewed as one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe to the TTIP .
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a form of parallel justice , through which companies can impose harm on taxpayers , roll back national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
In early positions , anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact deemed the EU Commission ’ s proposals insufficient .
Most importantly , they were not to be criticized for the already negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada ( Ceta ) .
Germany ’ s state secretary , Matthias Machnig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great advance .
The Commission takes into account key reform issues that German Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel made with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed plans for malaria flows .
The European BusinessEurope Association warned against curtailing the economy ’ s bottlenecks with too many new rules .
Small and medium-size enterprises , in particular , could be disadvantaged , they said .
When talks on the TTIP ( Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , Wednesday remains unclear .
Negotiations have been going on since mid-2013 .
But the issue of investor protection has so far not been discussed with the US .
Initially , a framework for the agreement should be set at the end of this year .
This date is no longer tenable .
The Delicate Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago , Sufjan Stevens was on the scene of Prime Minister Club ( now : Luxor ) .
Besides him , there is a patchwork on which the sober followers have filled the picturesque US state of Michigan .
The entire audience , roughly 40 people , is almost captured by Steven ’ s lecture .
It always tells the map , according to different places , what it reports its minuscule and arranged song .
Where they have grown up and what it looks like , in their home .
Stevens has since proven to be a wonderfully creative error .
The Great Lake State appears intelligently complicated with the third nightmare published in 2003 , which could harmoniously close itself to American torture in the late 1960 's , but could be tolerant at any moment .
" Michigan " is rumored to be the first part of a remote series : each of the 50 US states should subsequently be occupied .
But , as late as 2004 and in Rheineini , " Seven Swans " has already appeared , with positive expectations collapsing .
Reduced , Stevens is emerging .
Live suffice to Gitarre and Banjo .
A year later , New York 's musicians are returning to the show .
" Illinois " ( " Sufjan Stevens invites You : Come on Feel The Illinoise " ) looks like a widely celebrated masterpiece in 2005 .
Overborrowing from ideas and stylistic indifference .
The nightmare is rising into the American Billboard , and does not have an annual record of influential music media .
After extremely productive experimentation , Stevens is then using a very large electronic spare " The Age of Adz " ( 2010 ) .
This sixth orchestrated trial is still widely orchestrated , but carried out by programmed sequences or Beats and plays with all the effect and halls .
As smaller clubs emerged , refrigerators will become the cholera spectacle of neon-style breathing changes and large-scale fluoressing refrigerators .
At present , Sufjan Stevens is dead as part of a five-member band by Germany .
In the dark Hamburger More !
He mostly presents the " carrie & Lowell " available since March .
Although almost 2,000 guests now sit in their chairs , the much-traveled stevia is reverting to intimacy and torture .
Without a word to the audience , the group of excessive musicians is playing through the broad-based nightmare .
They hear from the audience : the lecture is " more opulent , " and they can essentially dismiss the " plate . "
Steven ’ s only modestly needs to be given , plays amazingly few elderly song , and finally gets connected under a dead applause .
Jeremy Corbyns ’ s Debt in the Prime Minister ’ s Questions
Since his election , Mr Corbyns ’ s debacle at the prime minister ’ s question has been greeted with tension .
Jeremy Corbyn , the new Labour leader , is said to have his debacle at the prime minister ’ s question , and to deal with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Corbyn will rise up to tackle the first of his six presumed questions shortly after midnight , with the media likely to test his performance and nearby Labour lawmakers .
He called for " less theater and more facts " at this weekly event .
He has also said that he could leapfrog some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyns , for it will be a member of the shadow cabinet and , after his speech , at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday .
In the meantime , Labour ’ s decision to remain quiet on the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain during the Tube ’ s sinking of the national anthem , provoked criticism by a number of Tory MPs , and is at the center of several front pages in newspapers .
Mr Corbynm ’ s decision not to sing the national anthem has grabbed attention .
As one Speaker of Mr Corbyn has said , he has " stood in respectful silence , " and he has recognized the Royal Air Force 's " heroism in the Battle of England . "
But a member of Mr Corbyns ’ s shadow cabinet , Owen Smith , told the BBC that he advised Labour leader to sing the national anthem " regardless of his belief that monarchy should be abolished .
Almost a dozen shadow-ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns ’ top team , invoking differences in economic , defense , and foreign policy , while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party initially backed him as a leader .
The BBC Robin Indut ’ s political correspondent says that political differences also " plug " within Labour , following Mr Corbyns ’ s comments on the European Union ’ s position and limits on profits .
Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour is preparing changes to remove the whole idea of limiting it altogether .
Hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow labor and pension minister , said that the party was " very clear " that it was only against government plans to cut the limit from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 .
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader who , since then he was Tory ’ s leader , has been over the last decade ahead of the parliament ’ s divisive box .
Labour , who promised another policy approach , says that he has " crowd sourced " ideas about questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 stimulations .
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister 's question is too confrontational , and that it will abandon both " cloudity " and infighting with disgust , instead focusing on serious problems like poverty , inequality , and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Corbyn has said that , when he does not participate , Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , is represented when he is not attended - for example , when Mr. Cameron is on the way abroad .
He has also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he has appealed to John Bercov , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
When he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the politics of a " casual theater , " often linked to the female prime minister 's fraud , but conceded a few years later that he had failed to do so .
Having been broadcast first in 1990 , the prime minister was seen as the main barometer of a leader ’ s ruling and leadership of his lower house and lower house , even though critics argued that it had become a cartoon , requiring far-reaching reforms .

Not bad .
Hundreds of fans accompanying justice yesterday .

How much meat , and how much potatoes the mirror , does not want to betray Alhay .
Only so much : " It tastes better , " he finds .

Metropolitan Farms-Black Fight Aldi
Metcash is seeking to protect the IGA filials from an aloud uprising in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food traders Metcash launched a ground campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Aldi invasion .
As Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia earlier next year , Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen ties with local food suppliers , and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing of social media , as well as on Events like Adelaideals .
IGA traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as egg manufacturers Simmo of Dunborough , who distributes samples in IGA stores and sells shopkeepers to loyal customers in the South Australia football League .
Metcash is expected to publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the big trader for food , alcohol , and equipment conducts its annual investment strategy .
The stakes are high , with South Australia and Western Australia accounting for almost 30 % of metashs of IGA stores and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA ’ s network in the East states .
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial , and IGA retailers have far more market share than in New South Wales , Victoria , and Quessland – more than 30 % in South Australia , and 24 % in Western Australia , compared to around 14 % in the East .
However , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that , 12 months after opening up his first markets , Aldi will swing away roughly 5 % of the food market in these two countries , taking away all existing players , but mostly self-employed retailers .
According to a report published this week , the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
This forecast assumes that next year , Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
The loss of food , food , and metabolic fat ’ s high fix base could cost metropolitan about $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr Kierath said .
At the same time , Metcash loses market share in the East states , mainly to Aldi and Coles , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashi ’ s sales of food and food will fall by 3.8 % in 2016 , 4.1 % in 2017 , and 2.1 % in 2018 , and will reduce the market share from 14 % in 2015 to 10.3 % by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass , the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , told a businessman in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to disappear within a decade .
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments made by Mr Douglass .
But it is assumed that a CEO of Metcash joined Mr Douglass last week .
IGA ’ s market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 % since 2010 , and revenues from metashi ’ s food and food trading , which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers , have fallen 43 % since 2012 , reflecting the deleveraging of operational debt , while imposing pressure on sales and margins .
Large traders , however , are resisting and investing more than $ 150 million to offset sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week , and to provide ICGA retailers with increasing freshness through fast-growing new foods and better selection of private-Label food .
Metcashi ’ s main businessman , Ian Morrice , says that price adjustments and laundry programs will be put in place , hoping that , for the first time in four years , big traders will return to profit growth in 2017 .
Thanasi Kokkinakis , the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy , is backing him .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior .
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the " collateral damage " in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgio , and , according to Steve Healy , deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behavior .
Kokkinakis , the younger of the talented Duos , dubbed " Special Ks , " was brought to the spotlight in the Montreal Master ’ s infamous clash with Stan Wawrinka .
In a humid skill game in Cincinnati soon after , Kokkinaki and his opponent , Ryan Harrison , had to be separated twice by refereeing judges , with Harrison saying that " Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios , and I should beat the child . "
Recently , he was seen to have shattered a tension sigh after a crush implanted a potential US Openo victory by Richard Gasquet , and Healy steadfastly defended Kokkinakis .
The teenager is now in Glasgov , competing with Sam Groth for second place in the single place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup-Cup semi-finals against Britain .
" One thing I think I am pretty much uplifted is the fact that , I think Thanhazi was dragged into the dispute , " said Healy .
He broke a beating because of a crusade in the US victims , but he is not the first to break a beating from fruit with himself , and I know Thanhazi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has behaved extremely well in US victims , even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so forth , and I think that he deserves much credit .
He has a good team around himself , has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated with a little too tightly .
He is a very mature 19-year old , working very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , is respected in the surrounding field , trained harshly , he is well in form , is a very stable and mature young Kerl , and I deserve to be judged by his own merits .
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgio in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the " common decision " as the right thing for all , but he assures the man of Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component . "
" First , we want the team to be focused entirely on competition , not all the controversy [ Kyrgios ] , " Healy said .
And I believe that Nick has risen very quickly , as people like Federers and Murray have pointed out , making some terrible mistakes , and deserving all the criticism he receives but we are trying to support him , try to understand the consequences of his actions . Some time beyond the spotlight that he can think about , I can think about it is reasonable , and it is best for him to be done .
Europe ’ s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary renounced the state of emergency and secured the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and kept everyone trying to enter the country illegally , all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
Chaos followed , as hundreds of migrants gathered in a Niemandland and Serbian officials responded with outrage .
For an unknown period , the people who fled violence were stuck and built tents on the streets between the two countries ’ checkpoints of control , and they settled .
But frustrations rose .
When a police helicopter was above them , the migrants chanted " the border ! " and shot insults against the Hungarian riot police .
Some rejected food and water protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister said that it is " unacceptable " that migrants would be returned from Hungary as Macedonia and Greece moved more and more .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
It must take place in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , ” Ivica Dacic said in Prague .
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc could not reconcile a common immigration policy at a divisive meeting in Brussels .
The ministers , however , agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece , who expressed hope that , by the end of the year , the EU countries would finally reach an agreement – next month or by the end of the year – that further 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary , would take in .
On Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent ’ s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an early move from Brussels or from its neighbors .
The service-imposed emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could close roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto has said that his country is also planning to build a chess wire along its border with Romania to stop inflows of migrants from infiltrating the country , after ending a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News-Correspondent Charlie D ' Agata reported that even prison inmates were used to create the trick between Hungary and Serbia .
In recent months , for many Syrian and elsewhere in the Middle East , Hungary has become a major shortage and point of incursion into the European Union .
But Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the coming economic migrants who are seeking a better life , not war migrants who are entitled to protect - a view that contrasts sharply with other EU states , including Germany .
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border , or the damage from the 4-foot ( 13 foot ) high fences that the government has built along the southern border with Serbia , a crime , which also imprisoned higher sentences for convicted human traffickers .
" Because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , " said government spokesperson Zoltan Kovaci 's reporters in the southern city of Seged .
We say very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament still needs to agree to the use of the military , which is expected to be next week , but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gyorgy Bakondi , a country-security adviser to Orban , said that in trying to cross the border , 15 others had already entered the country deeper .
They get over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody , and are accused of harassing crimes by new laws .
Authorities are rapidly fixing the fence .
Earlier this day , on Tuesday , two of the seven border crossings with Serbia came after a train agon was dragged with a barley to close the border .
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people ’ s data and express a crowd to join it .
Some 20 managed to do so , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway association of Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse to food and water until they could enter Hungary .
Election 2016 – Hillary Clinton ’ s lead in halving Bernie Sanders ’ s margin in national poll .
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for national nomination , but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her .
Clinton now has 47 % support in the primaries ( 58 % before that ) , while Sanders is second , with 27 % ( up by 17 % ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he will run for the presidency , is receiving support from 15 % of democratic voters in the primaries .
More than five months before the start of the primary elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is stipulated by what candidates they will support .
But Clinton ’ s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
Since the CBS News survey , Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups , while Sanders has made some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates , but those margins have narrowed .
Their support for men has fallen sharply , and Sanders is down to only 5 points .
Clinton ’ s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated , and now they and Sanders are on an equal scale .
But Clinton still has a large margin of electoral advantage .
Last month , Clinton was a double-digit liberal leader before Sanders , but Sanders now has a 5-point margin in the group .
Roughly half of the democratic electorate of the primaries in national elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
A quarter would support it with some reservations , and another 15 % would support it only because it is the candidate .
Six % would not support them .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton ’ s current supporters are most enthusiastic about it .
The views are more mingled among those who are not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them .
While 48 % of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say it about their leading contender , Donald Trump ( 35 % ) .
When asked in an open question why Clinton ’ s supporters want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 % ) , followed by the view that she is time for a woman to become ( 13 % ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
Clinton ’ s supporters are also mentioned of their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
It also cites consent to address problems and to voters .
Because the vice president cares for the presidency , 57 % of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though one-third believe that he should not .
When democratic voters are asked for the primaries who would be their second election for the party , Biden is at the top .
More than half of Clinton ’ s supporters say that Biden would be far ahead of Sanders ’ s second election .
When Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton ’ s pre-Sanders lead increases from 20 points to 30 points without him .
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best candidate to win , but this figure has fallen by 78 % last month .
Biden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage he regards as the " most vocal " has risen .
Nevertheless , when it comes to what matters more to a candidate , democratic voters call questions about eligibility .
As with last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters in the primaries .
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some important features in their party ’ s primaries .
majorities view Clinton , Sanders , and Biden as honest and credible , with strong leadership .
Biden is best served by the three candidates for honesty , while Clinton ’ s strength is leadership .
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about Sanders ( 15 % ) , but 27 % disagree .
Democratic voters in the primaries generally also view Clinton , Sanders , and Biden ideologically in conformity with their views .
For all these measures , about a quarter of Sanders ’ s democratic voters disagree .
Because questions about Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the tenure of Secretary of State continue to be asked , most Democratic voters in the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter , and say that it has not affected their views altogether .
But it is another story in the American public as a whole .
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration , while only about a third are satisfied .
Public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , even though 36 % said that her opinion had worsened .
They are mainly Republicans , more than six out of 10 who say that their Clinton views have become worse off .
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy of her party ’ s voters , this remains a problem for them among their entire voters : only 32 % consider them honest and credible , 8 % less than last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 % of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and credible person .
At the same time , 55 % of eligible voters in the country regard Trump as not honest or credible .
Clinton and Trump , however , receive good leadership notes .
Of the six candidates being tested , Biden , Carson , and Bush do best on honesty .
A majority of Sanders regards him as honest , but , like Carson , many disagree with him .
The margin for the showdown of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Carson , in the country-wide survey , is near Donald Trump
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in the latest poll by CBS News / New York Times
The two candidates now account for half of the new poll ’ s support , with others dramatically losing their guard .
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country , with support growing by 27 % in last CBS survey conducted before Fox News last month in the Tuesday poll .
But Carson shot from 6 % to 23 % over the same period .
The survey also found that Carson mattered well with demographic groups , outperforming Trump among Republican voters with higher education .
The rest of the field , with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kada , is down from 10 % last month to 2 % now , with Wisconsins Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen farthest .
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee , and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are at 6 % third .
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or Minus 6 % , and was conducted in September .
The latest CNN / ORC survey , published last week , shows Carson rising in the polls - it has 19 % support from Republicans , behind Trump , with 32 % support .
The recent ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed Trump well ahead of Carson .
Looking at a Carson rising last week , Trump found some soap hire for the former neurosurgeon , even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump ’ s faith .
" We need energy , " Trump said last Saturday during a campaign incident in Iowa .
Low temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is now 29 degrees warm .
Even if peaks are measured only remotely , a trip to the Mediterranean is already sufficient for bare-builders to find warm water .
A bathwater in the North or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at no more than 17 degrees .
Some no longer go to the sea : at most 18 degrees this week , Germany ’ s weather service ( DWD ) shares .
Bad temperatures , by contrast , continue to provide the Mediterranean : up to 29 ° C in the East .
It is 23 degrees at the top of the Adria , 23 degrees in France .
Egypt ’ s Red Sea comes to 28 degrees .
Five members of the Brotherhood are burdened with the death of Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a bullying rituals of a student in Pocono Mountains , Pennsylvania , death , assassination charges are filed against five individuals .
Members of New York City ’ s Baruch College Pi-Delta Brotherhood brutally attacked " Michael " Deng during a hereditary trip to the hospital in September 2013 , and delayed his transport , helping to kill him , divided the police .
Officials said he had been burdened with a 30-plus quiet of sand , and were repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field .
Deng , after all , complained about headache , then fell unconsciously .
The members of the Pi-Delta Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number after Deng became impotent and reportedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police say .
But they had time to change Deng ’ s clothes , govern his symptoms , and Andy Meng , the Brotherhood ’ s national president , said at a press conference to meet with him , said police chief Chris Wagner .
" At that point , members began hiding uranium sils and fundamentally condemning the Brotherhood 's well-being to that of Michael Deng , " said police chief Wagner .
He could not be revived , and he died of his injuries the next morning .
After a car report , Deng was repeatedly injured with stubborn injuries about his head , beatings , and uprisings .
“ Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood ’ s harassment . At least one student has died every year from the harassment since 1970 , ” said Douglas Fierberg , a lawyer who represents Deng ’ s family .
Failures and their members need to be held accountable , and that move is very important by authorities .
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for murder of the third degree for the first five members .
Thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Meng , are also charged with harassing harassment and education of a criminal organization .
" We not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it – officially or not officially – we will also hold them accountable , " Wagner said at a Tuesday press conference .
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rejected its belonging to the local group .
That will happen when the Fed raises Interest Rates
An increase comes , and the house will falter , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
We know that .
We do not know how long this will last and how long it will last .
In particular , history offers little guidance for the economy .
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and took 86 months .
The Federal Reserve ’ s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond .
Thus , Fed officials have stressed so fiercely that investors should focus not on when they start hiking interest rates , but on the period needed for normalization .
Indeed , several variables matter .
In the end , however , market participants may find that the entire excitement caused by a rate hike may have been exaggerated .
" The Fed 's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the " cheap money " era , said Julian Jessop , Chief Economics economist .
By contrast , we are not expecting a gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still too low for the shock that many seem to fear .
But this does not mean that there will be no repercussions .
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy might respond :
As the market saw last month , anticipating interest-rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
Once the increase arrives , influence is not so dramatic .
" There seems to be a tendency that wealth yields will be strangled 12-24 months after the first rate hike , perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy , " said German analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes .
More specifically , over the past 35 years , the market has mostly risen upward – around 14 % – on the path to hiking rates , quite flat in the 250 days after ( an average return of 2.6 % ) , then back to the norm after 500 days , with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 % , according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll , the CEO of Nuveen Asset Barron .
The Deutsche Bank said that the effect on equities tends to occur later in the cycle of appreciation , and that the return starts to decline .
Recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often encourage rate hikes .
In the current case , the Fed faces some of the conditions that were not previously available and that could accelerate a recession .
What is remarkable is that , at the Fed ’ s interest-rate hike , GDP will be near its lowest point .
According to Deutsche Bank , the 118 rate hikes since 1950 have been just twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 % .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect this to continue , and expect the third quarter , according to the Atlantic Fed , to be just 1.5 % .
Interest-rate hikes in such fragile economic scenes may be risky , raising questions about " whether this time is different , " the Deutsche Bank said .
Market participants argued all over this year for an interest-rate hike by the Fed , all eyes were directed at this week ’ s Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends on Donor Day .
Whereas many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting , futures trade is only one probability of 25 % .
" In our study , all surges from 1950 to now have occurred in a super-cycle of increasing GDP , overshadowing pre-recession levels very quickly after recovery began . "
By contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observable phase .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record has been 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipates a rate hike , and the pattern is rather similar to that in the capital market .
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in equities when they change their strategic course .
With bonds , yields seem to change direction once the first rate hike occurs in the cycle .
At the end of the cycle , bond yields are falling immediately , as the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schwab ’ s strategists believe that raising interest rates will bring yields between longer and shorter bonds closer and lead to a downward spike in the curve .
High-yielding bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , even though " we are cautious about expecting higher yields , " Kathy Jones , a fixed-income-income-analyst at Schwab , said in an analysis .
Interestingly , Jones says , markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations .
" Beyond the dollar 's strength and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy . "
Short-term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit spreads have widened , and volatility has risen - all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy .
In large and large part of their operations in the US , companies that account for more of their business will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Multinational high-debt firms will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market , as well as financing their debts .
“ History shows that " quality " stocks tend to react excessively three months after an initial rate hike , " Goldman Say analysts said in a report to customers .
Companies with a strong balance sheet have , on average , surpassed 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 , after each of the hikes in interest rates .
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also surpassed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) on average .
Debt becomes a big problem .
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside the purely stock market game , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers may see gains from higher returns , even if experts differ on how fast that will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MPs Andrew Bingham
The Conservative MP 's member criticized the station for " condemning " it .
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals .
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards , saying that they imitated only The Brits .
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice , saying that it was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 " turns " into Classic FM , claims a leading MP , and increases new pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that private channels are not doing .
The conservative MP , Andrew Bingham , also told the BBC bosses that the publicly-owned radio station was " stupid " and increasingly is no longer distinct from its commercial rivals .
" Radio 3 seems to use the word " stupid " but seems to turn into Classic FM , " he said .
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which began last year , appears to be only under a different name .
So , when you try to do something else , two spontaneously named examples of which you actually imitate only what is already on the market , " said Mr Bingham .
BBC Director-General rejected the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 would love far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to Live music and public education .
What I learn from Radio 3 is that I will learn about classical music nowhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly unsurpassed .
" And , he said , " the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important . "
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that working harder to hire the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
Radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing at the committee for selecting culture , media , and sports to run roughshod over commercial rivals .
Damien Collins , the Tory MP , attacked The Voice – the BBC ’ s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch manufacturer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
Do you understand why the program is often discussed because it is not an original one , not very markedly ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC was produced in a " special BBC " way , with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges .
He added that he wished that the company " will find a shot from our own house " when it launched an entertainment series next time .
But he refused to rule out the payoff of other ranks of The Voice in the future , or spend money on fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose most slowly in August , and the Black Friday may be responsible .
In the first three months of 2015 , there were seven % increases in online sales .
Last month , the lowest outcome has been since records began in 2000 .
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy .
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has held back spending .
For more than a decade , cyber shopping has boomed , and many of Britain ’ s main highways have turned into ghost cities .
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating , as new figures showed only 7 % in the first three months of 2015 .
Total spending on August produced the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , at just 5 % year on year .
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating , as new figures show only 7 % growth in the first three months of 2015 .
" If you look at the growth rates of the preceding years and decline until 2000 , it has always evolved over time , " said Andy Mulcahy , the editor of the IMRG sales dex , told the Guardian .
He explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began trading their phones with their mobile phones .
It meant that more people could buy online , and that people could do so in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
But that is now coming to a head , and we may see growth slow .
The black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as one reason for the decline in sales .
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before that event , which takes place on last Friday in November .
Last year , the average number of buyers worsened five times around their computers to make their checks , and some traders ’ Web sites plummeted .
Experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for barrels , could stop buyers from making purchases .
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £ 5 was spent slightly more than $ 1 per year online .
For some products , such as television and washing machines , more than one-third of purchases are now carried out through Web stores .
At the same time , more than a quarter of the population buys clothing and shoes online , rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried Mecca 's sick bullet accident -- Bin Laden 's family is sanctioned .
The bodies of 29 deaths are rolled through the streets by Muslims at the first breaches in Mecca .
Saudi Arabia Bin Laden ’ s Burden Fall
The health ministry also said that , after the crackdown crashed , 394 people were injured as well .
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were taken through the streets to bury those killed when a crank of Mecca ’ s grandmosque crashed .
Smourning , mostly white , was the baton of seeking their respect when the first of the dead visited their last trip to the Al Mosem-Friedhof .
The sadness process proceeded at the Holy Paces , where , just days earlier , a building crawled through the ceiling of the mosque and then into the beds .
The bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king imposed sanctions on Bin Laden ’ s construction company for the catastrophe that left 394 injured .
The corpses of 29 stars killed when a crony crashed through the Great Central Mosque Mecca were swept through the streets .
Among the dead , Qasim Akram was made up of Bolton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage when the Kran was overthrown .
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque before his parents began their annual Hajj .
Saudi officials have already said that the Hajj will go to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
Today , King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have steered the arm of the sick when he was not used .
An Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
The news agency ’ s English-language service did not report these details , but said that the company ’ s leadership was forbidden from travel abroad .
Earlier this week , Salman vowed to uncover what caused the fall of the sick , which plunged into an interior of the Great Mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj that took place later this month .
The Bin Laden group has issued no statements about de Kranger ’ s collapse , and its representatives have not been available to make a statement .
The royal decree also chipped the group for non-current security measures , and did not cooperate with meteorologists .
Dozens of tears surround Mecca ’ s grandmosque as part of the massive build-up led by the Bin Laden group .
The Bin Laden family has been linked to Saudi Arabia ’ s ruling family for decades , and is taking over major construction projects .
Al Qaeda ’ s late leader , Osama bin Laden , was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990 ’ s .
The collapse of the sick came in the midst of strong winds and rains , just days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom , for the pilgrimage , which is needed at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim .
Officials said that 158 people stayed in the hospital .
Officials ordered that 1 million Rial ( £ 174,000 ) be paid to those in the crop , and the same amount of permanent injuries .
Other injuries receive half that amount .
B & Q & Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over .
The British increasingly employ artisans , Veronique Laury
The number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has been increasing .
As a result , 200 more screening store stores targeted at artisans are being opened .
At the same time , Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q sellers nationwide .
From Rupert Stone , City Chef Correspondent at Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons put down their shame and peninsel in favor of the use of qualified East European artisans who carry out work at home .
If you can handle a hammer or a pendulum for cattle of walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
For Britons are increasingly employing artisans to carry out home workers in their homes , the company ’ s chief behind B & Q .
Véronique Laury , the new chief executive of Kingfisher who owns the construction chain , said that a large number of qualified artisans from Eastern Europe who offer services at rock-bottom prices had become obsolete .
As a result , Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops to artisans and close 60 BQ ’ s .
Mr ’ s Laury said that she wants more women to work in B & QShops , for eight women make ten purchasing decisions in the store .
For the moment , men outweigh the staff .
She said that it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that more women single-individual households have had more renovations than in the past .
Mr. Laury said , " It still works for a majority of men in our branches .
We need to shift this further toward balance .
In principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 % of the decisions to purchase articles from women .
Women play a big role in the decision-making process .
Mr ’ s laury , which is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed on the FTSE100 , has also restructured her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions .
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied 50 % of the team with women , including its management and financial board .
Mr. Laury said , " This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women for our board of directors .
Kingfisher reported a decline in semi-year gains and revenue after the group owed the costs of closing the strings .
From the trend , Kingfisher , who owns Screfix and B & Q , will open 200 new branches .
AI / Deputy on Trial
On the National Court of Deposit , on Wednesday , two members of the Austrian Volleyball-Vice Minister AI / Deputy were responsible for infidelity and choice .
The defendants were not guilty .
One was also accused of abuse of office .
He was legally acquitted of this charge in May .
The current process has been squandered .
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel , the investigation found that in 2006 to 2011 , the defendants used funds from United Nations Convention on which they could dispose of their functions for private purposes .
The damage is estimated at roughly € 400,000 .
Sports officials are also charged with financial offenses .
This was the chairman of the open station , Judge Michaela Sanin .
It is to be negotiated later .
In order to reject disloyalty , defense argued that no asset had ever been disadvantaged .
sporting officials would have reckoned with only allowances , and the sports club , which they would have operated from 1982 to 2011 and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money , would have issued debt - the liabilities totaled roughly 600,000 euros ( € 4,000 ) in 2001 .
" Back then , we were faced with the situation : do we keep or close the club ? " one of the defendants told one of them , in the brokerage of large financial firms .
He then decided , with his colleagues and colleagues , to do the job .
With all the risks .
" We required money , our life insurance provided as collateral to the bank , " he said with consent .
Force was agreed : they can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
Further , with appropriate financial success , the payoffs were readily determined by 1991 .
As a result , some of the expenses had been disbursed only years later , beginning in 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
As a result , lax , not detailed accounts , appeared to explain what was happening to the former Obmann .
The accounts and textbooks jointly managed the two defendants , and the other accused said .
The judge asked why the payments had not been detailed .
Citing had not interested in the details of financial exposure that what matters was debt freedom , the answer is .
When an official ’ s investigation of abuse of office started in 2011 , a sum of € 120,000 was transferred to the United Kingdom account .
Those had been recourse , the defendants explained .
The paper account was named by the second defendant , and , according to his statement , was not known to anyone .
" Why ? " the judge wanted to know .
That is the answer that the interviewer long did not know .
He said , after all , that he believed that this was best for clubs .
If he had done something , no one would have known the money , the prosecutor would have made the room .
The accused had been informed , the official justified .
This transfer was formulated as a " compensation compensation . "
Why do judges and prosecutors want to know why harm ?
The first defendant said that he was not complicit in the phrase , because no harm to the club was ever done .
But what I should do when the lawyer says , " You are all from the vanguard . "
" I am a lawyer , " he asked .
The official also said that he had never raised a penny , reporting only kilometers and diets .
He calculated the equivalent of $ 1,000 per month , but the actual outlay was much higher .
Early years , the defendants failed to show just the same documents .
They were no longer claimed after an operation in which everything had been judged correctly .
kilometers , too , had taken on the second accused .
All the obstacles had been made in cash , having had to move from his residence market to Bleiburg , he declared in his words .
The main negotiation will continue on September 23 with investigation of witnesses .
Hewlett-Packard Stells another 30,000 jobs .
In addition to the reduction in personnel that has been going on for three years , the computer table will reduce more jobs in splitting the company .
The proximity of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) is not over .
The US technology sector is planning to restructure its dismantling of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate saving .
This raised the cost of saving $ 2.7 billion ( $ 2.4 billion ) , while telling the company on Tuesday .
The move would lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which would come from the fourth quarter .
The 555,000 jobs that have been underway for three years have not yet been completed .
HP was still employing roughly 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013 business-year .
In retrospect , the Hewlett-Packard stock declined 2.3 % .
California ’ s Palo Alto is splitting with printing corporations : combining the computer and printing business into a new society this year - separated from more promising areas of computers and data storage for firms and other services .
Both parts of the deal are listed on the stock market .
A re-disappointing PC subsidy , together with weaker demand for its services , last added to the world ’ s second-largest PCP manufacturer , to Lenovo .
In the third headquarters at the end of July , sales of PC and printing declined by 11.5 % .
The sales fell by 8 % , to just $ 25.4 billion .
The proceeds thus receded in 15 quarters of 16 quarters .
HP responds to industrial change by fragmenting and projecting massive reviews .
The 76 year-old company , led by Meg Whitman , has only recently responded that customers are buying more smart phones and tablets , rather than conventional computers , and doing business online .
Whitman ’ s restructuring plan as a whole envisages reducing some 55,000 jobs .
The Anti-ISIS Education Mission
But direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would largely be rejected : 54 % opposed , 35 % were sympathetic .
61 % of other states are welcome to see airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .
24 % , by contrast , are opposed to intervening in the conflict .
Working with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad , 51 % of respondents reject that 20 % would do so .
29 % could not decide .
Automobile : Case on the 666th IAA press day .
The focus of the mass is on September 27 th of connected , self-driving cars and electricity mobility .
After two press operations , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open up the 66th International Automobile exhibition under the slogan of " mobility " on Donbas Day .
The broad audience can visit the IAA from Samstag .
The automobile association expects the equivalent of around 9,000 visitors two years ago .
Violence on Serb / Hungarian Frontier
Hungarian police have deployed several hundred refugees on Serbia ’ s border with Röszke Till and water workers .
Euronews-correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the breakdown of violence at the border point .
He reported telephone calls :
A group of refugees broke the line .
This had formed a police line , and a water crop was ready behind the policemen .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw tricks and plastic bottles to civil servants .
Officials initially used uninterrupted poppy speech .
Afterwards , the police used tears .
Much tear has been sprayed in the direction of refugees .
The group was dissolved .
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was pulled out of the zone .
Children who had breathed tear gas screamed .
Other refugees fell apart and suffered with respiratory suffering .
Serbian police press spokesmen also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and coffee spray .
The Fed ’ s Choice Time
The world watches when on two days , on Wednesday and Donbas , the Fed will meet to decide whether or not it will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade .
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who believed last week that the Fed would do so now thinks that the Fed will stay on the hook for a little longer and keep interest rates at 0 % - 0.25 % .
It is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL .
" For the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave zero and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates , " said Angel Ubide , the Director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The US economy is on a relatively good track record , with trillions of dollars added to the balance sheet and generating only low inflation .
But the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions .
It has warned markets to rise , but the evidence indicates that the odds against such a move are good .
The decision is to be made by 20,00 MDGs on Donbas Day .
Death-Protecting Delta State University
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday - and before shooting and killing his colleagues on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was " sorry for him " during the first murder , " and " he could not do so , " officials told Tuesday .
The Gauler police force , Mississippi , said that Lamb , a docant for geography , and Social Education at Delta State University , called Notrufnumberers against 10 : 00 on Monday .
He said that he shot somebody and killed someone .
Lamb said to the emergency staff staff that the police must send police to his home .
He said " I shot my wife evening , " and he also mentioned that a " sweet dog " is in the house but " nobody will disturb " but is likely to be excited .
The police asked the call for his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb made no explanation for his shoots .
When police watched the scene , they found the body of Amy Prentiss , 41 , and a handwriting Notice of Lamb , 45 , who said : " I dare , do so sorry , I wanted , to reverse it .
I loved amy , and it is the only woman who ever loved me . "
After writing Notiz , Lamb took 300 miles at Delta State University , where he killed Ethan Schmidt , a professor of history , before eventually taking his own life on Monday , when police encircled him .
University President William Lage Forge said he didn ' t know of a Lamb conflict with Schmidt , but " there was , of course , something in Mr Lamb 's idea . "
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt , the Tuesday authorities said that " there was no information , no evidence " of a " triangle relationship . "
Shawn O ' Steen , who said that they were married for about seven years , was described as a " good man . "
The two were abandoned 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O ’ Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was " destroyed on the ground . "
He said that Prentiss was their daughter " absolutely best friends . "
Prentiss worked online from home , according to Linsday Knowles , identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss .
Knowles said that Prentiss , who owned a dog named Lightning , has been meeting with Lamb for about three years .
" She wanted to help other people , " said Knowles .
The police said that Lamb called relatives on Monday to say " he is not jailed . "
When police catalyzed him in the high road 1 near Greville later this night , Lamb took his car aside , walked into the forest , killing himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , such as his life camp on the university ’ s Web site .
Stars who Lost their Happers
The actor ( left ) , in the image of his son Redmond ( right ) , had some stressful years .
He fought leukemia in 2001 , and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner , Farrah Fawcett , for cancer .
The actor is also said to have struggled with drugs , and he was convicted of drug possessions in 2008 .
All of this certainly exacts its toll .
Eurowings : Lufthansa is Rebuilding the corporation
The Lufthansa is planning a big corporate restructuring .
A half-billion euros a year will save the Lufantha Corporation alone with a better organization .
150 of the world ’ s 1,000 executives will cost business restructuring to work .
The pilot union has a new one .
The Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and adding value to Eurowings , which are cheap .
The realignment ’ s aim was an outcome of around € 500 million per year from cost and trigger synergies , with the airline sharing on Wednesday .
Among other things , the Lufthansa Board no longer holds for passenger .
Eurowings ’ s cheap line should be developed as freely as possible .
In the board of director Carsten Spowatch , Karl Ulrich Garnbrant will be responsible for Eurowings .
With the new edition , Spost underscores the importance of Eurowings , which will oppose Ryanair and Easyjet in the future .
So far , the organization of 120 strong firms has been complex .
Airline lines operated under the passage of Airline Group , which accounts for three-quarters of the € 30 billion annual rate .
New Negotiations with the Pilots
In the carrot conflict with Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resumed on that Thursday after the Judiciary strike .
That divided the union .
The topic of the talks is said to be the retirement of pilots .
Cockpit wants " to achieve results quickly in a year with a predicted record . "
The trade union / Airline conflict has led to divergent strikes in recent months .
background , in addition to the pilot 's transitional supply , is the " Wings Wings " concept .
The Lufthansa is supposed to outsource Eurowings to the firm ’ s own cheap line in the fight against competitors .
Under the title " Day Toward the South , " paintings of Leena are seen in the artificial house .
The long-based finner in gods has long assembled a selection of titles for the House White Saal that encourage their watchers to move in thoughtfully .
Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months because of a double diversion .
Luke Shaw suffered a double challenge to his right-wing legs in Manchester ’ s defeat at the PSV .
While this will shake off leftist foreign defense and exclude it from the Games for at least six months , Louis van Gaal does not offer the hope that Shaw can play on that season again .
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno at the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV .
He was treated nine minutes on the field , and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
According to Van Gaal , " he has a double bone correction and is in the hospital . "
He is moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United , who is 18 , has a very hard time , then play fantastically , and then does so .
In the dress cord , he had an oxygen mass .
He wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double question , it will take six months , and he will not play in the troop phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed fortunate to have escaped a Red Card and the imposition of a parent .
Nicola Rizzoli , the referee , did not punish Mexicans .
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong .
You can judge for yourself if I say that a parent meter and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack on both legs .
As one tweet put it to Shaws , " I think you are all for your news . I can not describe how broken I 'm , my path to recovery is now beginning , " I get back more . "
To this end , Manchester United States suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV .
The English defender has an additional incentive with the Euro championship in France to recover by next June .
Phillip Cocu , the PSV trainer , said , " It is a very bad injury . "
When a player walks away with this type of injury , all are sad .
It is never our players ’ intent to injure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a blow when Mexico played Van Gaal ’ s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
" He is very difficult because he was not intent on injuring the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad offense , " Cocu said .
I could not see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction , so it looked as if it had touched him [ Moreno ] , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
In the conversation with SBS6 , Moreno said , “ I know how hard that can be .
I feel very bad at it ; I am so sorry .
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital , after a parachute play by Chris Smalling .
To be sure , David Cameron knows better ?
It is one thing all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost for good .
They may not be David Cameron .
When asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite child book , the prime minister chose The Lorax , the 1971 Environmental Fable of Dr. Sea .
It was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message from the company ’ s superCamps Web site , " finally , moving , creative , and with a forceful message , it is a book I like to read my children , for there always seems to be an image or message that we have missed . "
All beautiful and good , except that the subsequent sales in which Cameron is reportedly describing the book ’ s act reflect , instead , a 2012 content comment on the 2012 film version added new characters and details to expand the rather short Origin text .
" In the midst of an enforced city of Thneed-Ville , where everyone has gone , and even the air is a good thing , a boy , Ted , the heart of Audrey , is hoping to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , " one reads .
As if this were not suspicious enough , the text submitted by Cameron reads in part like summarizing the Lorax film , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database Web site , begins : " In the turbocharged city of Thneed-Ville , where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win . "
While he admits that he is a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's act , which sounds an unnamed boy , like the local environment covered by the money-hungry " trees , thugs , despite protests by the naming Lorax , a hocking , " which promises to be ravaged in the name of the trees . "
Most likely , such a relatively low public-relations task has been delegated to a hero who has not read The Lorax 20 times behind one child .
One Downing Street spokesman said that the text probably came from Cameron ’ s Electoral Office .
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron ’ s employees , but offered no more direct comments .
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by expulsion from England ’ s team , but it is still difficult .
Reaching Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but not in my map when you look at the cadres that England has chosen to take to the gate , a repeat of the 3-0 test show defeat is at hand .
I would not rule out an outright victory .
Alastair Cook ’ s side may be less educated than three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Battacking effort , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear scars from 2012 , just a youthful positive attitude .
With the ball , Moeen Ali is becoming a spin bowler , and Adil Rashid , even if he is an unknown test-level size , is an option for the attack .
Adam Lyth is dropping from the English testing cadre and is being replaced by Alex Hales .
Of course , the decision to dismiss Adam Lyth is hard for me , as his chief trainer in Yorkshire , to analyze .
At his seven tests , there have been two good attacks on difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that crystal players are designed for results .
There were no questionnaires at Joe Root , for example , which led to the nomination , since players - and I have said that it was - are their own best selects .
Lyth would have been extended long ago , but he had control of his own fate .
If , one hopes , he will swing more purchases for Yorkshire , another opportunity will emerge .
The English trainer Tream Bayliss praised his position , even if he did not do so well , and that is not surprising to me ; he is above all a team-man .
It is difficult to ask how much time a test hall can buy to signal .
Lyth got seven opportunities - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton received nine .
Only Compton was given a chance to play home and outward .
The only accusation to be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was at its highest - but that lost opportunity lies in the past .
Alex Hales comes in , and he is a chapter that I cherish .
He is an X-factor cricketers of what we saw early in this season Yorkshire , when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge , which made us very much meet .
It must at least sustain the same opportunities that it faces , but this depends , of course , on the team ’ s performance in the United Arab Emirates .
The idea of letting Moeen beat next to Cook , which would produce an ex-spin bowler and receive four Quicks , appeared , and I have nothing about it .
I don ’ t see why a buffer can ’ t beat there , and those leftists have already shown that he is a vicious cycle of cricket players .
Moeen may not have finished his job for his County Worcestershire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
My former Teamline College , Justin Langer , played his first 38 tests on the first drug before he appeared as oppensioners in 2001 .
He immediately made three hundred Run and did not look back .
Zafar Ansari comes to the cadres as a Backup spinner , and in my limited handling , he has impressed me as a young man .
People may look at his statistics – 31 on average with the thugs and 35 with the ball – but there are no number of backup cronies who raise their hands and trainers chose youth .
He will learn a lot on this path .
Apart from the team , England has made some wise complements to the trauma .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawarded , the Sri Lanka Batsman , as an adviser to the test games could be a championship coup .
He is one of the game ’ s kindest corners , who will bring in a host of experiences , because he has played on every terms and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood is for the white Kuwait phase of the gates , bringing energy and energy into the seeds .
I have always felt that he was created for international cricket competition as a player or a coach , and , like Mahela , he has insights that we can benefit from .
Sometimes new voices can make fresh headwinds in the dress , even if the news is consistent with the previous one .
At Durham , Ben Stoke , Colly ’ s teamline colleague is not used at the One-Dayers , and Root received a similar pause against Australia , and I have no problem with it for my part .
Some will disagree , but coaches and team makers will not set the timetable .
And they must bear in mind that how their jobs depend on outcomes for players .
Such choices are not made lightly .
The Brexit camp ( Brexit ’ s exit from the EU ) could gain momentum if the economy falls into a slump by 2017 .
David Cameron 's ill-conceived renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will run deeper into trouble every day , even without the election of the genial Jeremy , " Is it yes or No ? " Corbyn as Labour ’ s leader or the TUC , which was tearing itself apart for Europe on Tuesday .
Foreigners also have their corbynages and Nigel Farages .
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states , as deeply enmeshed in various crises , as the EU is now , are not always on their own fault , Britain ’ s own agenda , with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly do not want .
In Brighton , the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it may not like it when it threatens social protection .
We might also call it Dave Georges and Stranger ’ s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , photographs of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reform .
It is always about me .
My European friend , who wants a United Kingdom that looks out of the doorstep - " Don ' t just with France , " says Berlin - shows that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals are to the point where they don ' t care whether we stay or go .
Germany ’ s cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave before she looks bad , as happened with the excessively long hardliners of Thatcher ( 11 years ) , Mitterrand ( 14 ) , and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France ’ s François Hollande is looking forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017 .
It is also a fading force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government , Spain on the left .
It is hard to imagine that they will pull themselves out to help selfish-Britons , whose energy should be better spent to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK -- something they don ' t want , because most similar separatist tendencies have .
So perhaps some such ministers are even deliberately unhelpful comments , particularly in the SNP style , during the United Kingdom ’ s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process , my friend suspects .
" The renegotiation was a default , " and " Britain has not gained any value from renegotiation . "
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense , and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons , but were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn , which supported our entry in 1973 with a two-to-one ratio .
They can recall Boris Johnson , the arch-euro opportunists who made a name as a " European Gerade-Banans " Brussels correspondent in the early 1990 's .
For all its craziness , Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
These included the Medley of Tax-fee-biased villains , telephone hacking foreigners , and the pseudo non-inland Pseudo , which own most of our major newspapers .
In fact , Tony Blair thought something similar to her , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla , you would be better distributed with bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
Indeed , Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself , resisting Cameron ’ s referendum frenzy , because Blair had put the principle above the EU ’ s unapproved constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a back door .
Nor has the press left him .
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn , who gave me a benign caliphate on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he was no longer using time to waste me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock ’ s 80-year strategy , a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but it must develop a coherent strategy for winning the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marr , whose BC-Sofa left him on Sunday .
Corbyni 's official position on Europe is -- I say it is friendly -- in development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside Ukip ’ s traditional Blarbon fuel tendency and the wild comrades of Tory ’ s small English-country tongues can say yes .
It is what the Hilary " said a Benn , but no Bennite " on radio and TV this week , when the peacemaker fought in his fight not to admit that Corbyns 's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea .
I was reminded of the 70-year old father seeking television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hillary ’ s struggle was even more attractive .
But to fight to remain " in all circumstances " - Benn 's expression - was not what McDonnell said , even as JC reported to its colleagues and legislators on its Monday meeting .
Whatever the corbyn 's glorious bottom-up image , remember that he even taught me , news discipline remains important around the clock in the TV era , and , above all , in the social-media framework , a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal .
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe , which allows him to hold Labour ’ s support in the referendum campaign for self-understanding , as McDonnell said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Corbyno 's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership -- in line with their Bennite siege economy , their anti-capitalist past -- are no longer merely a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents , for which little difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes .
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson , it is well convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of their superiors at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British when it can be pointless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed by poor military performance in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory Government , which I was reminded of when I started on Monday what the British Influence Security Forum called .
Experts criticize Public Health ’ s Cell of E-Cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less damaging than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , in part with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PHE ) in its report on e-cigarette cigarettes .
Last month , the PHE published the “ Basic Report , ” describing it as a " comprehensive review of the evidence . "
But some researchers challenged the resilience of the data , pointing to the links between some experts and tobacco industries .
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the " extraordinarily awkward basis " on which PHE established its most important conclusion .
Two other researchers wrote in BMTY , asking whether claims are " built on stone or sand . "
Martin McKee , a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell , a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool , said that " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on proof efficacy . "
They said that the public expects PHE to claim that " the best current estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking " is based on detailed verification and modeling .
Indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 who have been called to develop a model for multiple criterion decision-making analysis ( Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) to bring their opinions about the damage from various nicotine products ; the meeting ’ s findings were summarized in a research report .
McKee and Capewell said that a meeting sponsor was a joint company called EuroSwiss Health , whose CEO had previously received funds from British Tobacco ( BAT ) for an independent study .
He also signed the BAT ’ s public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that he was provided with an e-cigarette manufacturer , but did not add to the funding he was reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
The reasons for selecting members of the Panel are not delivered , but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions , some of them also requested an industry finance in paper .
Some other participants at the meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control .
The PHE ’ s tobacco management was also attended at the meeting .
The group 's research " tells us that there was a lack of " strong evidence of the harm of most products on most criteria , " wrote McKee and Capewell .
None of these links , however , is under discussion in the PHE report .
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that " there has been no evidence that e-cigarettes have been premature to smoke children or non-smokers . "
Prof Kevin Fenton , Director of Health and Prosperity at the PHE , said that the BMTY ’ s claims had been reacted earlier .
He said that " e-cigarettes are far less damaging than smoking . "
Each other life-long smoker dies from his addiction .
All the evidence suggests that e-cigarette health risks are low by comparison , but that we must continue to study the long-term impact .
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the proof is proof and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers posed by tobacco .
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion billion billion billion billion per year .
By clearly suggesting that e-cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we satisfy our national responsibility .
BBC should give up Eastders , says former Channel 4
Former Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice , saying that commercial rivals " would give their right arm " for Hitler 's shows like Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the kind of programs not donated by other UKSK broadcasts .
He criticized the BBC for placing public-health programs , which are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience , in a heavily disputed window of time against their rivals ’ most popular shows and those like BC4 .
After the BBBC director-general , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that , for six years , he had tried without success at Channel 4 to connect with the BBC .
“ I have had problems with the idea that BBC commissioned or sent programs that were clearly displayed by unsubsidized rivals , ” said to the BBC ’ s upper House Communist Committee , Johnson .
If you want to keep the screens , which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long run , you should at least respond to programs that don ’ t do or commission others .
They send The Voice in a first-rate window of opportunity for as much support as possible for their future .
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous ; it is , of course , nonsense .
As Johnson said , “ I don ’ t see why a regressive tax could be financed without subsidies .
The vote is such a scheme ; Eastster ’ s end is another , admittedly both productive .
Frankly , other channels would give their right arm .
I can see how this should be public-rights television .
I do not believe that this would actually reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepreneur who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was responsible for the hunt for evaluations " for the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support . "
His comments on the BBC ’ s most popular broadcasts reflect what former sky director Tony Ball proposed in his Macagenda-day speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC sell like Easters .
As Johnson has said , the more publicly-owned Niche Programs should go to BC4 , where much the audience can not be measured but can do their work , and they can argue that if they commit their hypocritical missions for justifying £ 4 billion ( $ 4 billion ) roles , " Now , of course , we have constructed all these obscure programs that no one has seen . "
They put them in a window of opportunity when no one ever wanted to see them .
As Johnson told the committee , “ I ask you to find a rather regressive system on terms of who can get the best value of it .
Of course , think everyone , we all think that you get a big deal worth 150 per year , but I wonder if this is true for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein , who also testified before the Tuesday committee , called for the BBC to " inform , educate , and maintain its travel mission . "
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % of radio - and it should take an example of this in " informed , enlightened , and entertained " on public television channels in Australia and Canada .
When asked about the partnerships , Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms , which he said will show only a handful of TV TV stations and build alliances with commercial channels to make everything available online .
Sunogenetics Can control brain cells through hall waves
The video shows how the nematodes are changing the direction at the moment when they are punished with clangimps .
Scientists have created worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of pitfalls .
The tiny nematodes are changing direction at the moment when they are punished with clangimps that have too much frictions for human obedience to be heard .
The impulse is working through the entering of Motoneuron cells that are genetically altered to carry the membranes that respond to ultrasound waves .
Here , too : Researchers reading and writing brains with Light
Researchers said that worms demonstrated the power of a new trial , called Sonogenetics , in which ultrasound could be used to activate a number of brain , heart , and muscle cells outside the body .
Sreekanth Chalasani , a Salk Institute researcher in La Jolla , California , told Guardian that the procedure may one day replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive process that gives electric impulses to people ’ s brains to treat Parkinson ’ s symptoms .
Chalasani usually does not respond to ultrasound , but they did when surrounded by liquidity with microskopian air bubbles .
The bubbles , he found , are amplifying ultrasound waves that enter into worms .
The increased ultrasound waves are affecting structures called the TRP 4 Ionwards channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
The hallwaves make the opening of these ion channels , and they activate the cells they are allocated , a Nature Communications report .
To create ultrasound nematodes , Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of its motor eurons , TRP I , wear .
If it applies to the changed cancer , it will reinforce and transfer it to the worms where it switches in the modified motor regions .
The procedure bears some resemblance to Optogenetics , a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch and eliminate neurons with impulses of light .
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technology .
Unlike light , which must be sent at an optical façade to the desired spot in the brain , low-frequency ultraviolet tissue can happen without interference , and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the scam .
" We believe that genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus can temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultraviolet sway in a clinical mindset for certain neurological treatments , " Chalasani said .
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insun cells , but they added .
Illegal torture devices - just in your doorstep !
The United Kingdom ’ s Arms Trading
Amnesty International Anti-Guns look at Messen-video .
Pollary Pollution !
Football Hidden Bubbles !
Stream bombs !
And electric shock rocks that cause agony but don ’ t leave a trace !
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that these charges are a fierce parody for the world ’ s largest weapons , produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government ’ s willingness to the limelight , to remove arms to oppressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equisition International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands .
Relative : DSEI guns : Authoritarian regimes flood to London
But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters who are watched at bus stations and in the subway trains that require a second sight .
" The important announcement : do you drive with the DLR on September 15-18 ? " ( Docklands Light Railway ) reads into the London Underground writing and the brands of the DLR line , which turns into an image of a tank .
In September , a black man of arms traffickers will drive with the DLR ... will be asked to help block weapons interests .
The 300 posters are of artists who have laid out their work at the Museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland .
A collectively named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London , using " Ad Space Hack Packs , " a pack of £ 6 , inbus encryption , which claims that " access to about a third of the planet 's bus-manufacturers gets access . "
Transport for London does not end up with this placatier " vandalism . "
One of the parody evidence produced by the Special Patrol Group .
According to Grindon , Kurator of Crueol Designs and Docent at the University of Essex , artists will become more critical and will try to bring political work to the audience outside of galeries .
Many artists join the work of activists within protest movements , noting that they must move out into the real world to allow their art to influence society .
Another anti-arms camp is greening the pendulums in the subway .
The amnesty video was seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook , and was created by the advertising agency VCCP , which works not-for-profit with the graph and voiceo artists , who work freely .
VCCP creativity director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence around advertising for the arms ’ interests – a Leone of the ex-Ceb calendar and thought : " Let 's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . "
They played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but " it remains more tainted by instigators of hall color and animation . "
" They have made a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment on the mass , " says Amnesty ’ s Tom Davies .
What is needed now is intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture departments will not be traded illegally on our doorstep .
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding weapons interests comes from the field of ExCeL , where issuers obscure fantastically euphemistic products .
In a press account , Saab revealed a commission from the US Army " to AT4CS , abandoned by the shoulders . "
This includes a " uniquely shaped warhead of fighting , " which delivers outstanding repercussions inside the target . "
Whatever that happens will not be pleasant .
Eight Golden Rules for Life in Students
11 years ago , I went to a university as a self-forgotten 19-year-old , still in the belief of Berets and Moral Relativism , but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have angered - and the numerous , long-lasting complaints about others .
Most of what I have learned can be destified in eight simple rules .
Introducing into university homes is from easily nervous , to absolutely frightening .
It is tempting to swing : people tell where you are , whether and where you are sabbling , where you are referring to Corbyn , and why you " don ' t love and hate " honestly , because in the seriousness , boys , it is only a midwife , HAHA , I 'm in my room . "
Take the trick .
And help others do the same – ask questions and show you interest .
It guides the conversation , helping you find out the people who you might not talk to , even if your chimpers were on fire and those fire extinguishers would be .
Let ’ s let people go .
People ’ s spaces often turn into certificates , film-night ceremonies , and local issues , but they are also the places where people attract and settle their underlaunders .
In this respect , don ’ t think about starting the uni misi with a relationship .
Introverted receive crude treatment at the university .
Their room should be a refuge , but many students ’ habits form a space system that is friendly and social , and that can lead to life friendship .
This can be the hell of someone trying to recover .
Nothing in culture allows you to say : " I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you must leave so that I get back the energy I have used for you . "
Try to feel when a fellow militant is exhausted - and send a SMS to him instead of cheering .
Apropos arrives : Tun it .
A Kerl in my university habits had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Freedom is closed through Backets .
Beginning the uni at the height of the Back-mania , the crowd is less strange than the arrival of will in the neighborhood , I have packed you . " So , and now , when I ask you a few personal questions . "
Providing homegrown leaks is a good way to open friendships .
Their residents feel obliged to entertain , and may end up associating your face with a empty surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent baker .
Bad mixed clones from Mehl , sugar , and fat cause people to sleep when you arrive .
stealing food is a common crime in student habits .
Of course , the clause of chicken is a theft , but is it the smallpox of milk for your tea ?
Consider milk owners .
The chances are that , even when they cook internally , they say they will service themselves .
When someone styles your matter , this is angry , and you have my compassion – but try to balance your mind more eggs than my fellow residents who added your milk to punish your thieves .
It is now in prison .
They should not take noise that keeps people from sleeping or working .
Not only is it about being a decent person , but that you are literally among the people in glass houses .
A girl on my river asked her neighbors whether it makes her guess to ease print and butter more , because she had a test on the morning .
They responded with even louder music .
When they finally stopped sitting at 5 a.m. , they happily let their neighbors sleep for two hours before plunging their own music , closing their door , and turning on for their three-hour test .
Wouldn ’ t it be romantic if your future spouse were randomly drawn into the same student habit ?
Conversely , if you think of an inhabitant for your future spouse , get to her , rejoin her , divide , and see her every day , and perhaps mimigrate to how to move all your friends ?
Of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot resident is definitely not your future spouse , at least you try to tell your submission a bit of reason .
At the exciting moment , when you notice that someone has left his key in his non-closed room , the line between an ulk and poppy flower than it appears .
A good empire is finally , but it takes only moments for it to become a banner .
Give you a valuable and amusing lesson about safety through hiding - but never do anybody with tooth pasta and Shampoo .
If you close your door and place your key to a glass that you will then put into the freezing - but don ' t tighten your holdings at the ceiling more than twice .
Traveling Houses for Refugees , Allow Houses
The real-estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building in the Central Bank ’ s Eckental Reickers for people who don ’ t have much money .
So , for example of refugees , but also as a signal : " Not only do the refugees need housing , but also the single mother and the recipient . "
" I see how you can still be cheaply and well built now , " the 44-year-old interview says .
Thousands of refugees will press for the housing market .
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how to create low-cost housing : he is building houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gildner , many refugees , will push for the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gildner : mass entertainment in containers or Turnhall has no sustainability .
For people remain a big part of it .
Given the flow of refugees , we need enough housing in the coming decades .
A wholly banal three-sized hospital is the solution .
Gildner : A hospital needs the least place .
It facilitates integration .
This is different when people are housed in housing blocs .
Each of the six homes just built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum-seekers .
Every unit of housing has two bedroom , a bed , a kitchen , and a residence zone .
It may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back .
Then again , homes can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
What are the costs ?
Gildner – The price of 160 square meters per home is € 184 , with no land .
That is manageable .
The construction lasted six months .
That is appropriate .
Have construction rules complicated their plans ?
Gildner : I constructed my project correctly .
In particular , the threat of Damocles always makes special construction and proxy order particularly complicated .
Gruselig .
There are still those who create three houses in a hospital need at least three positions .
Only cities lack the place to do so .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How did residents respond to their hospital project ?
Gildner : There were those who accused me of creating luxury building for asylum-seekers .
What is definitely wrong .
But don ’ t you exacerbate competition for affordable housing ?
Gildner : We have had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can barely afford more .
My project has the message , and ordinary people also need housing .
Not only refugees , but also the single mother or the dispossessed .
I see how one can still be cheaply and well built today .
That is why it is .
Markus Gildner ( 44 ) studied micro-systemic engineering in Regensburg and first focused on environmental analysis .
IOS 9 : How you get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is published
The new operating system can be called for by going to hire , by " generalized " forces , and then by choosing " software tupdate . "
If it is ready , the telephone will give you the option of download and then for instincts .
Some have encountered problems after the installation , because they receive a flaw that says that " software update " has failed .
To avoid the problem , users will recommend either waiting for the storm to recede or trying to update iTunes .
The telephone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
That may mean the lion of Apps in order to make way , but Apple has made it less likely by transplanting the uppet , just as it will be easier to do so when a special tool is used to destroy apps and then restart them once the process is completed .
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is loaded during updates or near a casual device so that the battery is loaded .
When clothing is too low , Apple does not allow the Update to continue , because the phone may be cut off in half a way , leading to a breakdown of the pilgrimage .
And yet , despite WatchOS ’ s delay in verifying iOS 9 : the least exciting yet best Update of OS 9 : How to prepare for the new telephone company .
They should also ensure that you have seen our checklists from your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do . IOS brings new functions , including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity feats for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and fix the operating system .
Rosberg ’ s Only Currency
Nico Rosberg knows only one foreign exchange in the battle for the World Cup ’ s title , in the Formel 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes-team , Lewis Hamilton .
The World Cup doubt stressed before the start in the crucial seven overseas race , " that I have nothing to lose . "
53 points separate the vice world champion from Singapore ’ s break-up on this Sunday of Title Defenders and two-fat champion Hamilton .
The Brite has already won seven of the previous 12 seasons , and is also taking the floodgates Grand Prix as a favorite in the city state .
In 2009 and last year , the 30-year-old bridge won the race .
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the great price of Singapore is not yet clear .
For days , a landlock over the city , triggered by fires on its neighbor , Sumatra .
Bad Kissinger Chess Club
The " Chess Club , " founded three months ago , " has added another member to its ranks , so membership has risen to 19 players .
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann , a passionate chess and tension player who was in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times .
Gauselmann is a first-tier federal earner . Cities of Espel and Line .
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein took up .
It is possible to include chess players who can not deliver .
Youth law and talent should also be pushed forward .
Gauselmann wants membership in the chess club , as well as friendly contact with the tennis club " Red White " , to reflect his attachment with the Kurds .
Quartierson-Bureau Directs
Saludis and the old-age center of Antonism have joined together under the umbrella of social management , opening a new running block at the Grave Stauffenberg Square .
In addition to consultations , they can participate in courses .
Social engineering is pulling it down from the mountain to downtown .
More specifically , the Grave Stauffenberg Square is .
There , a new master office was recently opened .
Here , just next to the shopping market , the elderly and the counseling community receive information on questions such as care insurance and services .
For years , we have found with our ambulent care-giving service that many patients are left alone .
Yet there are infinitely many questions .
" Nor is it rare to take many of the benefits of the purse , because the complexity of the insurance system is barely yet to be understood , " the new house ruler Jutta Weigand , who is also responsible for the antagonist , the Civic Spital , and the ambulent service " Adeus . "
In addition to the deliberations , the new Querit Office also offers prevention , health courses , and waves .
This has brought the Saludis to the boat .
Thus , additional offers , such as storage prevention , memory , or physical therapeutic treatment , can be used .
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis are ideally complementary .
Saludis represent prevention , prevention , and rehabilitation .
" The Senior Center for Healing and Caring , " described Heike Riedel , CEO of Saludis .
The reason for the opening of the new ministry office in downtown is that both business leaders see particularly demographic change .
For it is a good decentralized infrastructure that is essential for Bamberg ’ s particular municipalities in the future .
Moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) studied at the attendance ceremonies , the Querit Office also addresses the old age : " There are many events and offerings on the program , and these invitations are routinely healthy . "
This makes a big contribution that elderly people can live in their familiar environment as self-sustaining and well as possible .
The espionage agency is opened on Monday , Mittwoch , and Friday from 9 to 14 a.m. , Tube , and Donbas Day from 16-18 a.m to 12 a.m .
Bamberg 's entry against Wouburger Kickers on October 6 .
Now it is official : after remedial work at the merchark-stage stage stage for the FC ’ s entry of Bamberg against the third tycoon , Kickers , was not yet set , October 6 was set as a date .
The FC ’ s encounter with Bamberg in Bavarian football ’ s Achtels , Totopokal , against the third FC , Wouburg Kickers , has now been decisively eliminated .
Gambled on Tuesday , October 6 , at 19 in the Bamberger Fucharkstadiston .
" We are happy that we now know when the game is going forward , " according to FCE-Teammanagers Carlheinz Hümmer , who points to the ticket cards that are now underway .
It is special for our team to play against a third religion .
So we hope for many viewers , not without reason , because floodgates have a special appeal .
In the Round of the last 16 teams , the FC incurred Bamberg in 2010 through triumphs from the districts 1 . FC Col. FC ( 3 : 1 ) and home to the regional Allies 1 . FC swelled in 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .
The winner of competition is receiving € 5,000 ( $ 5,000 ) and qualifies for the DFB ’ s first round of United States-2017 .
The front-runner , Vgg underhaching , is third .
The Death of Karl Mang 92
Karl Mang , one of the doyens of Vienna ’ s architecture , is dead .
He died as early as September 5 , when he was 92 , as the artists ’ House of Services told .
With Mang , the House of Arts lost a honor member while " one of the most important architects of the second half of the twentieth century " in Vienna , as the exhibition called it .
Mang was born in Vienna in 1922 , during and after World War II , studied architecture in the engineering school in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann .
Since 1952 , he has been working as a liberating architect , but also as a teacher , writer , and institute director .
From 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute for Formergy .
In the 1980 ’ s , he was tasked with setting up the treasury chamber in Vienna Hofburg and rebuilding the palais lobkowitz to the Austrian theater museum .
Park-penalty : Tim Vienna charges policeman with Money
Former Tim Viese football players have been uncomfortable in brews .
Football hooks were once engaged in Tim Viese , ex-national sectorates in Germany , and Bremen and Houthness , but forests .
For the past two years , 30 kilograms of muscle have said that he has risen .
Intellectually , he did not object .
Wiese was just cut off in the Bremer city when he saw a Parkraum Guardian outburst as punishing his white Chevrolet Camaro .
As Viese rushed out of business , officials insulated , and threw her fine to the feet of the " image " paper .
In the city of Bremon , the charges are vindicated , but are not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
" The matter is still being tested , " the city of Brezhnev says .
Only then will it or not be determined whether Vienna is shown .

Gone to 17-Year Afghans
The police are watching for an incident in Bad Soden-Salcopy : at the Friday night , at 23,45 , three young men were heading for foot from Bad Soden to salmon .
One of the group , a 17-year-old Afghan , has , according to the police , succeeded his two friends in a distance of about five meters , telling them to wait for him .
At that point , the group was at the height of the bundle .
At the Tanker site , three people also stood up .
One of these men has joined the teenagers , beating them with the fence .
The victim suffered from a nascent breakdown and bleaked heavily .
When his two friends rushed to invite and appease the thugs , he initially abandoned his victims .
His friends have now brought the injured young man home .
The perpetrator pursued the group with one Pkkov up to their homes , and was demonstrably over there .
When the vehicle was not seen anymore , the injured before the building to smoke a cigarette .
There , the thugs and another male person attacked him again .
Caught by a brush , they looked into the face and surface of the victim .
The injured needed to be brought into a hospital for medical care .
So far , only a vague description is required .
One of the men was about 1.80 meters large .
The second thug was supposed to have been around 1.65 meters big , and was plagued with a jean and a brown white shirt .
The police are witnessing and instructors to register beneath the phone number of 06061 / 100-123 .
Dr. Frank Müler takes over fields and invests € 310,000 .
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller ( from the left ) are taking over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel .
Moreover , wilddebtor Bernd Bormann , economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz , and Asendorf ’ s mayor , Heinfried Kabbert , are pleased .
In many places in the country , however , doctors lack it – Asendorf is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field on October 1 .
As soon as the hook goes to retirement , her husband , Karl-Heinrich , will be in half his successor in the months ahead .
After a transformation phase , furniture reawakens the practice on October 12 , when it invested € 310,000 in the wheels on St.-Marcellus 6 .
It was empathetic at first glance when the field field learned from Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll , who is currently completing their training in the hereditary hospital and seeking to enter into practice next year .
" We have always had in mind that the garbage would fit this practice , " Dr. Ursel says , go rocks and beat .
" When it happened , I simply called them . "
For the spouse , the idea was to run its own practice in Asendorf .
" Proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , " the 39-year-old person says .
" We want to know and accompany families over the years . "
He also sees fit to be his own boss soon .
Thus , they agreed that the garbage purchased the house with practice .
Where , however , they will continue to be in brown villages .
There , the two family father , Frank Müller , has also grown up , his medical student in Hanxiver followed stations in several drug boxes and hospitals in Sulture , Nienburg , and Rotenbourg .
He is now a chief practitioner in Sulingen , and has been appointed to a leading editorial doctor in 2009 , and is honorably engaged in the DRC ’ s willingness to win houses .
From September 19 onwards , practice is being prepared for the new boss .
Whereas the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich field works as a house doctor , his gattin Ursel ( Internistin ) has specialized in the host rooms .
The garbage , both internists , wants to be replaced by housing-doctors .
" So the endoopia comes out , " says the 38-year-old Silvia Mumer-Gongoll .
As it is rebuilt , the trees will look more modern .
We will offer more ultrasound investigations , long-term and stresses , and need a room more .
Moreover , the EDV is being totally restored .
A total of € 50,000 provides the garbage of a land ( € 25,000 ) program , as well as the Velvet Community ( $ 12500 ) and the Community ( € 12500 ) .
" This illustrates how proud and happy we are that practice is being carried forward , " says the wild debtor Bernd Bormann .
Some 2,000 patients get into practice , according to Silvia Mumer-Gongoll , every quarter in which North German average practice is around 500 .
Asendorf has another house boat .
A positive side effect of the Praxi takeover by Frank Müller : the apotheoke , according to the Urban , remains a rock in Asendorf .
If no successor had found himself , it would have gone .
Those who visit Müller ’ s high hour continue to watch , incidentally , in familiar face : the seven medical professionals and cleanup power take over from the fields .
With its departure from Asendorf , physicians have been practicing it for 30 years .
" At the beginning , we had only two spaces , " recalls fields flamboyant .
They feel some passion after the long time .
" But , after all , we continue to live in high moor , and many patients will surely see it many more often , " says the mistyles .
Her husband adds : " We have a 6000-square meters land . "
" So far , I have always shied away from garment work ; now that may be different . "
Moreover , the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel .
Croatia : " We Leave the Refugees
" Now border controls will also be high on our southern border , " said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitener .
The controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also make it " self-evident . "
Popular supplies and safety are at the forefront .
But it is also clear that " it needs clear signals , " the minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept borderless flows of migration , even across the Austrian / Slovenia border .
It needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering " corridor " - Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously shared , Slovenia wanted to let refugees travel to Austria and Germany , and perhaps also build corridors for refugees .
Likewise , in Laibach , the interior minister , Vesna GyörKing , did not see Znidar .
The idea of corridors is " totally unacceptable , " and Slovenia will intensify controls on the border , particularly Hungary .
The border with Croatia is already highly controlled as an outsider to the Schengen Council .
As the minister emphasized , however , Slovenia does not want to close its borders to refugees .
" Any EU member state must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system can not function , " stressed by Györks Znidar .
As the Croatian government has said , the first refugees would have attempted to endure in the afternoon hours at the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing in East Croatia to evade registration .
Croatian police could pick up them in the nearby corn fields .
According to local media , the Croatian Tovarnik has consistently infected police vehicles with new refugees since .
They are mostly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
Bailouts and the Red Cross are also in use .
In the coming days , his country with roughly 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said .
Moreover , on the Maedonian-Serbian border that had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , Presevo buses would be shifted to Croatia , reporting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
The government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was wise to take certain routes : " Neither we can nor do we want to . "
In any case , according to media reports , a first bus with roughly 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid was arrived in the early days , with more buses expected in the day .
Beyond Croatia , Slovenia , and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been ready all night from Serbia ’ s 500-mile Medonia border .
" We have heard that Hungary has risen , so the police have told us that we should drive here , " one of the refugees said .
They wanted to go further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia , and Austria .
This may indeed lead to a bit more Western , as observers predicted by the Balkans Route of Turkey ’ s Greeks Mazedonia and Serbia Hungary .
Croatia : " Improving Borrow
Croatia ’ s interior minister , Ostojic , had earlier emphasized that his country was preparing adequate plans for emergency conditions if refugees were growing .
He did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as non-Schengen member , had " a comprehensive cap-and-control capacity . "
They enforce strict controls to qualify for Schengen membership .
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , when EU partners have consistently been putting the country on good testimony to the standard of border controls .
On the Serbian side , some 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border .
According to Belgrade , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos leading to Röszk .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely imprisoned .
Whether remaining refugees will now want to travel to the Croatian border is unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down early on a lotwear screen in Horgos : he premature debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
It would not be very large now .
One can not yet say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia , or any other country .
Help Migrants Up to Perilous Alternatives
But private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the maps that include alternative rotation rotation lines .
But the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : parts of the border still have mineral fields unchanged 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
On midweek afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of minerals was sent in the border region .
The Stock Market Hacker : Ukrainians Pay $ 30 million
Supranranonok is said to have been a ring of cyber criminals accused of getting insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on Web sites such as business hosts , marketwired , and PR Newswire since 2010 .
The information that has been exploited is intended to make insider-trading in financial markets .
That way , according to the investigators , more than $ 100 million was added to the total .
" Today 's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , " says the ECC .
In that case , the 32 additional charges lasted .
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
The perpetrators are said to have acted out of both the US and Eastern Europe .
Ecumenical Hospice Aid for Mannheim has been around 20 years .
Paradise , at home , has real operations .
People do their worries , sometimes fast , sometimes painfully melting .
They are steering the two stations of Mannheimer ’ s autosalon at the helm ’ s heart .
City routes hold .
Cultivating " before I am dying , " he said ... "
Ecumenical hospice aid has made the move to its 20-year record attended , and faces mixed reactions .
" It 's about life , so we have gone to the city and among the people , " says Joseph fine Lammer .
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is as available to the passertors for questions and conversations as are honest officials .
While some a Passant spontaneously goes to the circle and says the phrase " my life forth , " " read , " with which the US " goes " " to stop the war or " do not long , " others remain short , read , say , " I 'm not yet " and go on .
Over and over again , small debates about the move itself , about life , about how to deal with death .
Peter Hübinger , too , is on the ground .
" Only when I make clear that the end of the world comes to me at some point can I live responsibly , " says Diakonian Mannheim , a director of the Diakonan Workforce that is co-sponsored with the Caritasan Association of Ecumenical Hospices .
So this public-relations effort is good for 20 years .
But it is understandable that not everyone wants to share in the pockets , after all , that it is a very personal affair .
The death and death issue remains taboo , says Joseph Fine Lammer ’ s experience , though the hospice movement has done much to make people open in recent years .
An assessment that shares Angelia Godefroid .
The euthanasia and mourning actresses are among the honest officials in the first hour .
Personal experience confronts the issue , reading it with a lot of literature , and choosing to engage in euthanasia .
When Ecumenical hospices were appealing for honor , they immediately spoke , if it was established in 1995 .
Godefroid is one of 45 honor officials – 43 women and two men – who accompany individuals and family members in households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hospice , Sankt Vincent .
All are carefully trained .
Angelia Godefroid can handle its tasks and the experiences and experiences that it provides .
" I see life from another perspective , think it inexpensive and value the moment , " she says .
The ambulent Ecumenical Hospice service is free and non-sectarian .
Financial support from family and family members ’ health centers and contributions enables training and training and supervisions of mortality and mourning .
Every two years , training is offered for new workers .
The Tafles described on Saturday are now issued in the Home of the English Church ( M1 , 1a ) and in the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
There , too , more personal wishes can be listed on postcards .
Mixing Fedo ’ s Essential 2016 Financial Process
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant slashed its profit outlook for an entire year , owing to weaker demand for women services and higher costs in his bored-line transport service .
The company also said that it plans to hire about 555,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
Last year , FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time .
The stock fell 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday , more than 2.5 % in the premarket trade .
FedEx Corp. said that it earns between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May , 20 cents less than in previous projections .
Analysts , according to a survey by FactSet , expected $ 10.84 .
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which are averaging 4.9 % and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher boredom benefits from heavy and large packages raised from November 4 .
The company said that the outcome would still be expected to increase relative to last year , owing to lower costs , higher revenues , and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that if one considers the weaker economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade , the company yields " solid returns . "
Plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers , roughly the same number last year .
In the quarter ending on August 31 , FedEx earned $ 692 million , 6 % more , than last year .
The result was $ 2.42 per asset , just below $ 2.44 per share , which twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research .
The sales rose 5 % , to $ 12.3 billion .
Six of the analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $ 12.23 billion .
FedEx has experienced a decline in the international prioritization sand in recent years that has led to stagnation in his unity of expressions .
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of FedEx Ground .
In the last quarter , sales rose 29 % , but the operational outcome was essentially flat , owing to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance .
The expressions unit had higher revenues , owing to higher prices , while higher labor costs have lowered the outcome .
In price trading , roughly an hour before the opening , Fedo ’ s stock fell by $ 3.85 , or 2.5 % , to $ 150.15 .
On Tuesday , they closed at 11 % per year and 17 % below a record high on June 11 .
At its most anticipated annual meeting this week , the Federal Reserve spent roughly one 27-foot of Honduras-Mahagoni Table to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade .
Threats to an end to the forgotten two-tier meeting room are a watershed picture of the United States .
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation ’ s economic interests before all other things .
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximize US employment and prices here .
But , since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it , with the Donbas Day announcing whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off by the unprecedented stimulus from the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
Although most economic data show that they are growing more robustly , the recent global financial market turmoil could make already cautious Fed officials anxious to increase this volatility by raising the federal bond interest rate – even by a quarter of a percentage point .
" Obviously , the labor market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they observe , " said Lindsey M. Piegza , the chief economist in the brokerage firm Nicolaus & Co .
" But I think that if they were searching for an excuse not to raise the interest rate , the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global market is sufficient justification to keep waiting , " she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do in itself what is unsettling about the financial market .
Roughly half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week .
But financial markets expect the Fed to wait , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of raising .
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate , unless strategists ameliorate the blow by pledging that a further increase is far removed .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,59.85 .
The move was triggered by expectations that the Fed ’ s policy will keep the sentence this week , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody ’ s Capital Markets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates at that time , " he said .
If she does , " she must go very far in her statement to calm financial markets so that they won ' t panic . "
Other experts argued that an increase would calm financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed acted .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed poised to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in slow monetary tightening that would test the strength of the US recovery .
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress was needed , they expected the sentence to increase this year .
Although job creation slowed in August , this year ’ s labor-market improvement was solid .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years , and close to what the Fed regards as full employment .
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
And , while inflation was consistently below the 2 % annual target , Fed officials said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
The economy " can handle higher interest rates and need them because of the tension in the labor market , " said Ian Shepdson , Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
But financial markets around the world collapsed late last month , after China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slowdown in China ’ s economy would reduce global growth .
The market has recovered somewhat this month , with the Dow now close to 10 % below its May high .
For Fed officials , market turmoil affects complex calculations of when to raise interest rates .
“ If events in financial markets and news of the Chinese economy ’ s weakness had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tighten the strings at this meeting , ” Stephen D. Oliner , Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Center for Real Estate , said , and a former US Federal Reserve official .
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to manage the impact better .
" There is plenty of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and almost no reliable data describing developments in China , " said Oliner .
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed ’ s main concerns , so it should not be technical in its decision-making .
But , in effect , the Fed has become the world ’ s monetary authority .
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
In 2013 , the mere indication by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke that the Fed could " narrow " its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , Fed officials can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision-making is " more art than science , " said Zachary Karabell , head of the global strategy for managing Envestnet Inc 's wealth .
As Jeffrey Lacker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA , observed earlier this month , “ the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial-market movements seemingly incompatible with economic fundamentals . ”
Lacker , the voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , has cited decisions as an example in 1998-1999 .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its policy rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings , " despite limited discernable effects on US growth , " said Lacker .
A year later , Fed officials reversed these cuts .
The Fed should place aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis , such as the 2008 market breakdown , said Adam S. Posen , a former member of the Bank of England ’ s Interest-Rate Committee .
The recent turmoil is not near that level , he said .
“ It certainly does not want to get into the situation in which it is afraid to raise interest rates , ” said Posen , the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the twin mandate , not financial stability , and I do not believe it should be over time .

Parken : LAX-C has its own park holdings , together with other shops and restaurants .
Even if the store is well visited , finding a parking place is not hard .
Hoyerswerda : Small Life Refugee
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days .
Preventing them with warm will is not without the commitment of countless honorable aid workers .
There are also a number of people who support unself-serving asylum-seekers in the city .
These include Petra and Klaus Hein .
Petra Hein is a teacher who is careless and soul .
They still like to learn with their 74 lectures .
Every Donor Day , she is doing it on the Dillinger Street for asylum .
It helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo , and Pakistan learn the German language .
Of course , this is vastly different from education .
Brazil ’ s pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding .
SPRS , a Brazilian pediatric organization , is trying to clarify women in shocking ways about the importance of good nutrition during the breastfeeding period , with the presentation of pictures of baby that suck up to breasts that are malnourished with images of unhealthy food .
Mothers ’ milk consists of a variety of proteins , fat , vitamins , and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
Additional energy demands will lead pregnant women and young mothers to increase their daily calorie levels by about 500 calories per day .
But new research suggests that higher calorie levels are not the only diaetic adaptation that mothers should make .
A recent study led by Robert Waterland , a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors .
Unfortunately , unhealthy nutrition can negatively affect the immune system .
Exceptions to the New Bernters Sporthall
The Bernried Council approved the construction proposal for the € 2.3 million ( $ 2.3 million ) expensive sports hall .
And he was an exception .
The roof can become more flat for solar power .
Plans for the long-desired Turnal hal construction of the sports ’ Bernans are stepping forward , with the processed construction bid unanimously sanctioned in the most recent Joint Council .
Before that , the panel had , among other things , adopted an application to a technical " exception " of respect " liberation " from the existing construction plan .
The " exception " was permission for a special form of demarcation .
So a " satellite dage with non-compliant first and homelands " is to be built .
The background for planning is to use the solar panels ’ waters : " This brings us together a wonderfully large South Asia , " declared Mayor Joseph Steigenberger in the session .
The " liberation " was , in turn , a bias to be less than ten degrees below 10 degrees for engines , as opposed to the construction plan .
The volume of the dogs is sharply reduced .
" Liberation " was necessary because the construction plan does not permit " exceptions " - with the Council 's Bernanke 's Council usually more restrictive to liberation councils .
But Turnal construction is not a recurring project : " We are not setting a precedent , " he claims .
Turnal construction at the sports center is a community project of the community and the SV Bernried .
The cost is roughly € 2.3 million .
Subsidies are expected to be promoted for shop and transport .
In the next step of action , the 18-3rd construction request for the 18-36 meters big hall is now being submitted to the countryside office for review .
Minik Peightberg Goes to Songau
The Peitzberg hospital is said to be closed sooner than planned – in 2016 .
At the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become a new medical director at the hospital of Songau .
The station and majority of employees move from Peiberg to Schongau .
This includes the hospital ’ s surprising plans for GmbH , which certified Andrea Jochner-White .
But a decision is made on the board , and September 23 is dancing on the upcoming Wednesday .
If the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 hospital workers would continue to be employed at Peiberg .
The overwhelming majority should switch to Schongau with Fischer and the continued interior station .
The trees are there .
Jochner White argues that workers who can not compete in Songau should be offered a job in Christmas .
The staff are informed about the plans .
The change has triggered the announcement of Dr. Andreas Eder , who has now changed to private practice to the hospital only since the start of the year of doctors ’ director of the Songauer clinic .
The question of who to succeed him came into play , according to Jochner-White , the name " Fischer , " who agreed to take over the lead on October 1 and change with his team to Schongau .
For the house in Songau , this always meant " appreciation " and broadening the " inner medicine " supply , says Jochner-White .
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac cardiac makers and deficit hubs .
Songau ( 180 bed ) is specialized at the interior station in gastroological illnesses .
For the next two years , if the board agrees to lead both houses , Fischer will be allowed to do both by next year ’ s former hospital of scarcity , which still has 35 beds , to be closed in roadside , after almost 140 years .
So far , the countryside has planned this for 2018 , when remedial cleanup at the hospital is completed .
Rural councilor Jochner-White , who also heads the board , has been in rumors that the house held by the federal scarcity should be used in future as a refuge for asylum-seekers .
" I exclude this . " As the real-estate industry continues , Jochner White could not say there are several considerations .
There is now a short-term nurture of the Caritas and a daytime sychiatry .
" What better could not happen , we don ' t get back such an opportunity , " Fischer says , about quasi-departure from the Lech , which was " positive and very understandable " by the staff .
There was no real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been a doctor for more than 30 years .
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of the doctor .
The Peitzberg hospital ( once 100 bed ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , with departments closed , such as surgical surgery and birth aid .
Today , the handlers of Rhein-Neckar lions are called upon to eat the Bergian HC ( 20.15 watch ) .
The federal government ’ s tobacco leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for hubris .
In the last season , the BHC Bavaria was wrenching and benign .
Hunting With Two Last in Pratau
Two tractor-drivers were severely injured during their corn crop on Tuesday afternoon .
During the Abernaut on a corn field at Pratau , Wittenberg ( county circle ) , several boys were in use , as the police told .
After a gun handover , a 63 and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
How , exactly , the accident was unclear at first .
The criminal police are investigating .
The Failure of 16-year-olds from Rheinland Pfalz Victims of Violence
One suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from Rheinland Pfalz since Saturday .
In interrogation , the 20-year-old admitted that they killed the young and threw their bodies into a canal in rock stores .
A 16-year-olds missing from Rheinland Pfalz since Saturday have fallen victim to a violent crime .
The suffering of the young woman was found at the Tuesday meeting in rock sculpts , as prosecutors and police told the Mittwednesday .
A 20-year-old , also detained in the service sector , is suspected of giving up the incident and leading investigators to the body ’ s foundation .
The 16-year-olds had been missing on Sunday morning , after not having come home as agreed upon on the eve of a visit to rock sands on the eve of a plant .
In search of the young woman , investigators first met the victims ’ personal objections .
After all , surveys of the friend and the acquaintances of the missing found some suspicion against the 20-year-olds .
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to become a channel in rock sats , where the body was found .
According to the detention , the authorities admitted to police interrogation that killed 16-year-olds and put the body in the channel .
The 20-year-old should be brought to prison at the Wednesday , the investigators beat him the death toll .
Including the closer circumstances of the act is intended to bring further investigations .
Refugees Need Refugees : Studies Home Gaps
The situation in Germany ’ s housing market is tense .
More and more refugees are also searching for affordable meat .
Domestic market pressures are mounting .
Social housing faces a challenge .
The distribution struggles in Germany ’ s housing market have already begun .
With the EU ’ s arriving refugees and job seekers , more and more people are pushing for a market already overburdened in many large cities .
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing .
To meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020 .
The result is a study commissioned for the Association of Social Households .
For comparison , 260,000 units are taking place in Germany this year .
That leaves 140,000 homes missing .
Refugees , after the first three months of residence , are no longer required to live in a first-time refuge as asylum-seekers .
Many then enter the housing market and join the long lines in front of rental housing .
According to the German Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum-seekers were raised last year .
The negative performance of the housing market , however , is not just due to the rising number of refugees .
The study also constitutes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is running a housing deficit that grows from year to year .
Currently , some 770,000 housing units were already missing in the population areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
Many professions therefore resided in large cities in venture towns .
Young adults remained inadvertently longer in the " Hotel Mama " because of the slump in the housing market .
In major cities , the number of square meter per capita per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
To solve the problem , the Alliance proposes a reset of " social housing . "
In doing so , new incentives are being restored to social housing .
Thus , the Green Commerce Tax could be eliminated and the property tax on owner-occupied housing fixed .
Moreover , the Alliance calls for attractive fiscal write-offs .
The SWF ’ s refugee assistance program already goes well to cities and municipalities .
A good week after the start , at the end of the month of 184 million euros , more than half of the € 300 million at its disposal .
Now the project could even be scaled up .
Refugees have free passion : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor .
After Hungary , virtually no more , as more and more refugees vote the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces that without hurdles , Slovenia will travel to the north .
But the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to agree with Slovenia ’ s neighbors on establishing a corridor for refugees .
" I have spoken to Slovenia 's interior minister , " and when necessary , we will organize a corridor , " the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria , and is already part of the Schengen zone .
The EU 's Croatia country is not yet a Schengen Country .
After the Serbian / Hungarian border was closed , hundreds of refugees have broken to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people had gotten across the border with Tovarnik , the Croatian television station reported RTL .
Hungary had settled its border for refugees the previous day .
New laws that enacted the same day also make orderly asylum procedures virtually redundant in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said , " They can travel , and we are preparing for this possibility . "
These people are there , they are women , children , and men who want to live and reach something .
But it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
Croatia ’ s police had taken up Croatia on the morning of the first refugees on Serbia ’ s border with Serbia .
According to most media reports , Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan are concentrated .
They came to the Serbian border with both the bus and Taxes , Sid .
Immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to take root over the green border to Croatia .
On the Croatian-Serbian border , the refugees are not on the border .
There are other dangers to this : there are still sharp mines of the Yugoslav civil war of the 1990 ’ s .
Mining rooms are said to be creating safe passage quickly .
Hungary , meanwhile , is home to few more refugees after closing the border .
By Tuesday , police counted 366 people .
Shortly before the Monday , it had been 9380 .
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as criminal .
Thus , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern city of Szeged .
The convicted threaten prison terms of up to five years and deportation from the country .
According to the immigration agency , the total of 94 asylum applications at the Tuesday of the newly established " transitions " had been met with nearly all - 93 - most important transitions .
Among the claimants , 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly , are in the labor force .
At midnight , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
In practice , however , no one has any prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
According to Hungary , Serbia is a " safe third country . "
The migrant asylum-seekers who have been defeated are said to be deferred .
Before the " transit zone " in a mafia , only a few hundred refugees gathered .
In a malignant fashion , workers are beginning to clean up .
They collected the garbage left behind by tens of thousands of people on the street in recent weeks .
Sperritters were dismantled , and one of the host population was rebuilt .
No one wanted to express itself .
Austria still has few refugees following its closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
The country has also strengthened its border controls .
But the 20,000 migrants were still in the country , following government reports .
In Salzburg , some 1,400 people are awaiting Germany ’ s journey .
The move from there to Germany was stopped on the previous day by German authorities .
In free movement , smaller groups of refugees routinely took root .
Mayors were " stranded " across the border .
" We were preoccupied with cleaning up Sunday after the bridge was set , when ten people with travel workers were suddenly on the squeeze , " according to Wernstone 's mayor , Alois City .
Tourists , they wanted the move to Passau .
But , because Germany had shut down railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it ended in Wernstein , " urban leaders who immediately offered their help and , together with two other aides and their cars , traveled across the border with the Middle East Passau .
Before that , we sucked the unhoped guests , with recess and drinks .
We have just said that we bring them to Passau .
" That was self-evident , " says Oil-NC talks .
They were grateful .
A man could not be taken to give up a generous donation – € 100 for the fire brigade .
" That has pleased us very well , " says municipalities .
The stranded train passengers switched from an ICE to a passenger on the Sunday night , following the recent announcement that railway traffic to Germany was stopped but tried across the border .
Regional withdrawal , however , was abandoned in Wernstein ’ s interior .
In Wernstein , the border crossing is generally high .
The bridge , healthy with Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , has been sports – organized by the Union of Wernstein and Bavaria from New Circuses – before this year .
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypocritical politics :
Instead of immediately helping in the camp of Röszke build structures that ensure humanity , our German chancellor has moved highly officially and publicly to the orbit of Nazism ’ s stance .
Not only are those Austrians who now face chaotic conditions in the border areas .
The migrants , too , will have to find that the " promised land " that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp .
It will be a major challenge , given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter to provide us with dignity for the vulnerable .
And maintaining peace , security , and stability in Austria will be an even greater one .
Control searching for 35,000 intermittent quarters
Conrad has hands to do with refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to say that his word matters .
The government has used the formerly powerful Raiffi bankers to arouse quarticles for the thousands of refugees .
The mayhem at the first-time center of Traiskirchen has already gripped Konrad .
" We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchens , " he reported of his first success .
Likewise , the submission of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday to Austria was without much hurricane said in Konrad , praising the organizational " championship . "
The interior ministry , however , spoke of a " crisis-ridden situation . "
Overall , Konrad expects 85,000 quarters in this year .
To meet the number , an additional 35,000 will need to be found in the next few weeks – 20,000 countries will be provided , 15,000 of the federal .
We can make it if it becomes more refugees .
" But it is not a barrel without land , " Konrad said .
He has already held talks with national capitals .
They would have assured him that he would also create calamities for the coming refugees .
" The colonels are doing well , " says Ferry Maier .
The former DP Mandatar supports Konrad .
Tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn on how the Church will help .
Great expectations are also placing the asylum coordinator in the ORF process of " aid like us . "
At the platform , private individuals can offer straightforward housing .
Moreover , one hopes for hotels in winter .
Conrad and Maize yesterday criticized the standards of submission as " very high . "
In times of emergency , it can not be that issuers must have some degree of discretion or supreme size .
For a while , “ emergency standards ” would have to be applied .
That he is more successful than the interior ministry ’ s failure to back up his record .
I am an older man who is not being told the truth without more .
Conventional power is his main weapon .
Conrad and Maize do not cause the republic the costs they declared themselves .
They want to increase their workforce to 3-4 .
Initial exploration has so far failed to succeed .
Konrad wanted to create a container at Stephanlatz as an office .
But there seem to be problems with permission .
Linz demands a Better Divide
For the moment , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings , such as Tibet ’ s arena and design centers , are planning the city Linz .
This is not necessary now , because they can now be stopped without these measures , Mayor Klaus Luger ( SP ) says .
But more locations should be tested for an emergency .
Criticism is made by the city chief in dividing refugees within the country .
Other districts must do their part .
" Limits are not Diseded
In a longer phone call with Bavaria ’ s Prime Minister Horst Seehofer ( CSU ) , Chancellor Joseph Pühringer of the Exchequer Joseph Phringer ( VP ) has corresponded on Monday to further refugee action .
I have reassured that Germany ’ s borders will not be sealed .
Continuing refugees to the Federal Republic remains possible .
But here is the right border controls .
For the time being , there will be no special settlements with refugees to Germany .
But the protective seekers would be brought to Germany with regular moves .
Phringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue .
The recurrence of Austria on its borders is a logical consequence of German behavior for Phringer .
The Next Runtastic is a Time Question
The " new advertising " of the left industrial era is officially completed .
In four of the six stages of the office and production building , the listed IT company , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) , has been dragged into new , innovative technology companies .
" In IT , smart heads are our commodity - and we need to try to work for us , " says S & T chief Hannes Dutch .
He could imagine investing in startup companies in new advertises , and then fixing them .
From the outset , S & T wants to cooperate with its new neighbors – a good deal that its House of Representatives promises : " The next Runtastic is only a matter of time . "
€ 1.7 million has been invested in locations by S & T , € 3.3 million from the techno-center , which has ever been one-third of the city of Linz , the country ’ s Colonel Empire , and the Federation ( FFG ) .
The building is seduced by the Linz AG for 60 years to S & T and techno-center .
30 % of the 2700 square meter of land in the building are already hybrid , with another 40 % calling .
The Second Persian Business of Lia Peronist
The new shop focuses on splash handbags .
Indeed , Jutta wanted to settle a dog .
That effort had to briefly postpone the 49-year-old holder of Lia Peroni in the Tauband Arkade : after all , she has now grown up in the form of another local business .
The span shop , in which it sells , pockets , cheese , shoes , and clothes of different producers , is all about the Swela brand ’ s Damenchants that it should have euros worth 75 .
Larger pockets and accessoires cost up to € 500 .
Since then , the new shop has been operating .
Several weeks ago , it was rebuilt .
" But I have long pondered whether I should still open a store , " says Battle .
The key to the decision was , among other things , that the splash producers at home in Bologna were also squandered by the idea of their own position , where only their cellphones are sold .
" We are the only people in the Great Lead that the brand is selling , " says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots .
Their mode interest has thrown fire from their mother into the cradle .
I look most when something develops , and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
Why so many women are reeling in their eyes with beautiful handbags , can ’ t experts certainly answer with last resort .
Perhaps it is because a beautiful pocket upgrades every outfit .
The Callcity Bruler
Donald Trump ’ s Pdue ancestors came from a place whose residents are called servants .
This quality also links some to the billionaire who wants to be US President .
Donald Trump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
Whether he speaks xenophobic , journalists shout , or gaps in international crisis politics , the candidate for the US presidency vigorously whips up the campaign .
And it does well .
This is also being registered in an elderly city , where the grandparents of the real-estate billionaire come from .
The New Yorker with the caste is a term for many in the winter village on the WeinStreet Road .
Some in the 1200 inhabitant place are more than one in more than one - idle corners .
His grandfather came from the Pfalz town : Donald Trump , here in the campaign mode .
The city of Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump .
And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the world ’ s most powerful man ?
" I believe that this is somehow exciting , but not so deeply impressed in their hallmark , " says Simone Wendel .
The native crowd city has turned on an amusing documentary film about the location and its famous cronies , including the Heinz family as well as Trump .
Trump , not known for modesty , also has a word in " Kings of Kallstadt " ( 2014 ) , saying that he would surely succeed if he lived in Callcity .
He has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
While there is respect for family performance , neither does it tend to think that Trump is a bit big , ” says little .
Coincidentally , the nickname that the Kallstadt has in circles was " The Blrulesmaker " : the servants , she says .
So Trump comes from the employees ’ village .
The Trump success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a locally for gold graves in the US .
The cornerstone of the property account was the first land purchases in New York .
But the lives of grandparents were not free of tragedy : their desire to return home indefinitely failed in the Bavarian state , which belonged to the pilgrimage at the time .
He did not accept Trump because he had once hacked without approval , and he had declared Roland Paul the Institute ’ s director a movie start .
Trump is the grandson of an " illegal emigration . "
This contrasts with what the descendants sometimes say .
This had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
" Just as the poll is not as sympathetic , " says Hans-Joachim Bender , a remote relative of Trump ( " Oma was a born trump , the Opa was born Heinz . " )
Retirement winter looks more distant to Americans , " it is always so revealing . "
Does he believe that Trump comes ?
" I can not imagine this , " the 72-year-old says .
" He never cared about his fellow city . "
The retirees , Veronika Schramm , like some Kallstadter , mentioned that on a visit to Heinz , a family comment ended up giving way to churches , which generally matters well .
" I can not imagine this from Donald , " the 68-year-olds say .
They do better if he does not win the election , because " I don ' t know whether it is good . "
If those who had been in charge at his grandfather 's time in the US had been like " he would never have come there . "
" There are more interesting topics than him , " says Winter Sarah Boller .
And as president ?
" My president is not , " she says .
" The grievances will be ripe even without the president Trump . "
Wendel ’ s film , for which Trump has long been interviewed , has seen 1,000 mothers , including interest in the US .
The super-Bavarian community of Ramsau at mountainsides is Germany 's first " mining village . "
From the hands of Germany ’ s vice president , Ludwig Wucherpeg , the 1800-inhabitant village in the National Park of Berchtesgades , on Wednesday , received the award for soft tourism .
In Austria , there are already 20 " mining villages . "
In neighboring countries , the penny there is a responsibility for giving the award .
A " mining village " must have at most 2500 inhabitants .
At least one-fifth of its area must be allocated as a safe haven .
Seven ’ s Sunday crisis dominates assessments , despite Nine ’ s attempts to take over the loss of leadership in the show .
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of the Liberal leadership , but it did not make much of a shift in the assessment of the day .
Nine ’ s spring show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott .
The Sunnis crisis , with which moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage , was in London as part of a one-week spate of international TV broadcasts , including Dubai , New York , Niagara if , and Cancun .
This disadvantage seemed to play no part in Australian TV viewers , as the Sunnis crisis averaged 397,000 of the five capitals , compared to 3339,000 .
He received a slight increase from the advice for Monday ( 317,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 283,000 ) , but his figure lagged behind that of the last Thursday ( 343,000 ) .
In recent months , the gap with Sunnis has closed in .
On average , in August , Today averaged 318,000 compared to 330,000 Sunnis crises .
At the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September , the Sunnis crisis has averaged 349,000 to 314,000 .
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
The winds of change concern these homelands more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are right , thoughtful for scrutiny !

The great news for Seven was the impressive debust of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to Rafters Erik Thomson .
The new drama of a recently beaten father who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand coastline reached an impressive number of 1.219 million viewers .
Critics wondered if Thomson could carry a Hitler Solo without Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney .
Yesterday 's dinner result answered this with a clear " yes . "
The Seven factor stayed strong , with 136 million viewers , and easily beat The Block ( 8388,000 ) and TBL Families ( 726,000 ) .
Seven had mixed evening results from The Chase Australia .

The second half-hour ( 17-300-1800 ) came to 623,000 viewers – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat ( 613,000 ) .
At the Monday end , the first half-hour of The Chase Australia received 520,000 viewers and a full 720,000 in the second half hour .
Hot Seat averages 620,000 .
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will confidently agree that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail by 17 to 30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for $ million minute that failed to surpass McGuire ’ s show .

The last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he elect ?
Secret unveil ? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows , Sarah Mackay , and Snezana Markoski may be uncertain about who wins The Bachelor .
The woman , when Sam Wood , finally land in The Bachelor , was shrouded into major secrecy .
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one receiving the last one .
But when we started with Sarah Mackay , Snezana Markoski , and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before becoming two , you may have provided an inadvertent on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lip firmly down until the final on Donbas Day .
All three women have lyrically dismissed why Wood is the perfect man , naming his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitudes as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
However , if you don ' t ask the question , " who should get Woods last Rose ? " their answers could become a spoiler , who won the heart of the butcher .
Jeavons-Fellows and Markosky quickly called them - other than themselves - Mackay the best partner for Woodod .
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from one day to another .
" From the moment I went home , and ( Sarahs ) and Sams expressed energy , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought it all the way , " said Yavons-era fields .
" Sarah adds to the earth 's two feet , " it makes so much fun to be connected with it . "
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
They feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood are well placed as couples .
From her perspective , Mackay said that last week 's home visit made it clear that Wood " could be the one . "
" Once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I 'm now unconditional on him , " she said .
And when asked who should vote for Wood , if not , then she was puzzling .
" I don ' t know if I can say that , " she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana .
The Bachelor is broadcast on the Wednesday , 19 : 30 a.m .
Initially published as Sarah , the first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL-career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the US – and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula , and looks like a wise decision .
Some trainers would have banned Hayne from playing the bank for the rest of the game , losing a scramble as the Extended Rugyl Liga convert did during his first Punt return on Tuesota in its 20-3 victory against Minnesota .
But Tomsula trusted his husband , giving Hayne the next chance to reclaim Punt-Return , as well as the ongoing game of a violation of Bush .
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dress cord after the game .
He encouraged it , rather than maximizing his roots before the rest of the team ’ s chickens .
Tomsula also publicly styne at his press conference after the game .
The 49er sport Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by the co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey , who advised him to forget his patented fang and take care of the next game .
Jarryd Hayne is patched at a pig restored in the first district by the Minnesota Vikings .
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian credentials had hoped for his NFL-Debt .
Hayne left the playing field after the ruble , and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamih & Andy to 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFLN career .
" That was a thing that is now occurring , just look after the next game , " he said .
Hayne compared the carcer to his Origin Debüt in 2007 , when a passport in his own homeland led to a Queen Try .
Overall , however , it was a good experience for the 27-year-olds .
Hayne positioned a photo of fans , holding an Australian flag after the game , putting it on his summer rampage .
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights for the gay .

Free voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria , owing to high numbers of refugees .
At the outset of the FWW fuel clause in Great Whale City , Hubert Aiwanger , she warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria 's schools if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : " We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to save schools from collapse , " Aiwanger said . "
" Otherwise , we will find dislocations in Bavarian education systems . "
The Free-Voters ’ countryside survey dates to Friday in subversive local communities .
In fact , very different key issues were envisaged .
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voter Meetings as well .
" Of course , the subject of asylum will overwhelm the clause , " Aiwanger said .
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN safe zones for refugees in Syria , just as they existed during the Yugoslavia wars of the 1990 's .
" So we don ' t go on , we have to be due to the causes , " said the Free Voter boss .
Retail asylum-seekers want to shield the free electorate as quickly as possible .
Thus , Aiwanger demanded more staff from the governing courts responsible for asylum : " We also need at least 50 new asylum-seekers , " said Aiwanger .
The head of the FC criticized the fact that several federal countries were not consistent : " We need uniform standards of the federal countries " at home .
" Bavaria postpones ; others don ' t . "
" We need to become more capable of acting . "
But national politics in big walls should not be dropped below the table .
A years-long drought remains the order of the day : education policy .
In the new school year , Cultural Minister Ludwig Spaenle ( CSU ) launched the pilot " middle class plus " that extends the number of high school students from three to four years - the result is another nine years to the abyss .
But Aiwanger is not enough .
" The G9 issue must be accelerated , " the WEF chief said .
We call for freedom of choice for all Gymnasia who want it .
Free ride to the G9 wherever it is wanted .

Four People are killed after police shoot up on demonstrators in Nepal .
Four people , including a four-year-old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after police shot up in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
The violence broke out in Rupandehi district , about 175 miles west of the capital , Kathmandu .
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal , the senior district official , said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , with some of you dropping stone bombs and arson bombs .
Mr Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets .
20 police and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the incarcerated tumors that they know could kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative seem to produce so high a death rate .
The controversy has been the last weeks of violent protests at Nepal ’ s southern levels , where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political clout .
There have also been protests in the western Nepal from Tharus ’ s ethnic group that want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since the 10 th .
August , when the four main political parties signed an agreement to partition the country into provinces - an important step toward a new constitution , but a very contentious issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
Working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
Construction in the City
The land of the youth center of Old Post is to be rebuilt .
The city is preparing everything for commercialization of the 4000-square meters area .
There is a mix of trade , trade , and housing that is planned - but there is no concrete supply yet .
Empires – the city of Emden – is posting around 4,000 square meters of land in direct neighborhoods to the Old Post youth center .
The preparations for this are now underway .
The idea is to use the stock of money to combine trade , business , and housing .
They wait for corresponding offers , says the city .
What investor questions is not yet clear .
As a result , no treaties have been concluded .
The city of Emden had bought part of the land that lies on the roadside / corner street a few months ago , shutting down the buildings in place .
The Project Hieve : Details on the Table
Plans for vacation at the Small Sea are taking shape at embryos .
The investor first made public plans for the project .
Many incumbents remain unsettled - they fear selling out of their leisure space .
Monatelang had been negotiated , weighed , debated , and recorded behind closed doors .
Promises for a new vacation resettlement at the Small Sea are now on the table .
The interest , the Central Bank 's " System Building " company , was made public for the first time at the Monday 's town Development Committee .
Initially , this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda .
Under pressure from the project 's critics and the FDP faction , which accused investors and administration of secrecy , Ralf Behrends went from System-building management to the offensive : " We don ' t have all the questions yet to answer , " he told the Council members , and more than 50 visitors .
But it is good to face all the rumors now .
The € 10-12 million ( $ 112 million ) has been in the discussion for months .
Crony reactions among maritime owners who had come to the meeting produced the images and new details of desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , a maritime buyer , and a CEO in the interest of the lover , Pro Hieve , complains : " This is a huge conglomerate who is surprised by all other buildings . "
He also fears , like many other project-criticism , that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : " Because all blasts must come to pay for themselves , " he argues . "
But what is happening exactly on the very good hectare of the former host is still open .
There is no operator yet .
" First , we must have a coherent concept , " Ralf Behrends said .
Because it was missing , construction plans are also variable .
Twin Powers at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy with his gorillas grown .
The 26-year-old Dian has brought twins to the world yesterday .
Twin births are rare in Gorillas .
The last in a German zoo is back almost 50 years , and it was said in Frankfurt in 1967 , too .
The sex of the newborn Gorillav twins is not yet fixed , because Mother Dian has kept them firmly in the body .
At first , the " picture " had been reported .
NHC foresees 60 % chance for Cyclone south of the Kapverdian Islands .
The US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a broad low-printing system of around 350 miles ( 560 kilometers ) south of the most southeastern Kapverdian islands , which has a 60 % chance of developing into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours .
Another well-defined deep-printing system , for example , in the middle between the Kapverdic Islands and the Small Antiliminaries has also had a 60 % potential to form a tropical hurricane storm in the next two days , adding to Miami ’ s weather experts .
Google is launching a two-fold donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees .
Google Inc ( GOOGL . O ) announced a two-fold donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations by fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the fundraising call on its blog .
Instead of letting a manager announce , Rita Masoud , a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
" Our journey included many dark railways and buses , as did hunger , thirst , color , and fear , " she wrote .
I was lucky .
But , as Europe ’ s refugee and migrant crisis has grown , many people , like my family , are desperately looking for help .
Donations go to four nonprofit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , the International Rescue Committee , Save the Children , and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said that the first global donations are doubled , to $ 11 million , from 5.5 million to googood-com .
Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely owing to Syria ’ s four-year civil war , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .
Yasmeen Abutaleb ’ s reporting ; Christian Plumb ’ s treatment
To easily overweight diabetics , appetites can help .
The benefits of losing weight for easily overweight people with 2 diabetes can take at least five years , according to a new study .
It is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments .
" The mortality data require a long time to show something , " said Dr. Robin Blackstone , an expert on the weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial to the new JAMA Surgery study .
weighty loss operations or Adipositas surgery use various methods to reduce the size of the grain .
They reduce hunger and limit their own ability to absorb food .
Over the years , Adipositas have proved efficient to treat Typ-2 diabetes , but most trials have been conducted in people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index of 35 or higher .
BMI , some of the weight of size , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and that people with a BMI are more than 30 are considered obese .
They can calculate your BMI : 1 . usa.gov / 10ZqDv .
In the new study , researchers from Taiwan ’ s Min-Sheng General Hospital have used data that they have collected since 2007 to compare two types of Adipositas surgeon surgery – madrasas and gazine education – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
The average BMI fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
Meanwhile , the BMI remained roughly the same in 29 non-surgical diabetes .
Among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % eliminated the diabetes disease altogether , with 28 % partially .
In the medical and treatment group , diabetes completely dissolved at just 1 % , and only about 2 % in part .
Moreover , the results were generally better in the `` surgical ' ' group in controlling the bloodshed , triglyceride , and " bad " cholesterins . "
Researchers also monitored the patient blood mirror of Hemoglobin A1c , which reflects the bleeding value over time .
Her hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 % , the researchers write .
After the operation , average Hemoglobin A1c fell from around 9 % to around 6 % .
But the medical treatment group remained stable , at around 8 % .
But this better " glyccal control " -- reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level -- did not reduce mortality in five years , as Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues did .
The research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the Bypassi surgical group lost more weight relative to the host group ( 18.7 % vs. 14.2 kilograms ) , completed larger declines in the BMI ( 7.4 % against 5.1 % ) , and hemoglobin A1c ( 3.1 % vs2.1 % ) , compared to a total extension of diabetes ( 46.9 % ) .
Whereas the new study shows no surgical survival advantage after five years , there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life , Blackstone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix , says .
In the Swedish study , it was roughly 29 % less likely to die over 15 years from obese people undergoing an Adipositas operation , compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival among surgical patients , Blackstone said that it was reassuring for those with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the trial .
" This is the critical point of the study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , " she said , without increased risk of death or a kidney disease .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
" I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , " she said .
I think that once they have amended these genetic changes , which have tied their bodies to obesity and diabetes , it is really difficult to reverse . "
Playing the Love History
It is an issue that is now gaining greater attention in the siege styles : a young woman , unpopular and inconsequential in school hours , goes back to her youth ’ s blacks for years , and he loves in her .
As in the recent novel " We are not as " Luisa Binder . "
Beyond love history , the novel is likely to be particularly interesting to hardliners , for it is playing in long-term and surrounding communities .
The chief professional writer has grown up in long time , enjoying the ability of her home to create a literary monument .
" It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe " - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe can not absorb all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was looming .
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees .
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom to the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford , which deals with ethics studies .
He demanded that the interests of humanity be vested in the circumstances in place before the interests of individual nations , or even continents .
He also emphasized that Western European countries ’ response to the refugee crisis , while admirable , was inadequate .
" It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , " he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria ’ s efforts to cope with the crisis , he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution .
" Concerning for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions , " as real peace and development , mainly through education , can be created for these Muslim countries , " he emphasized .
Ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We need to reduce the use of force .
" The use of force never solved these problems , " he added .
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence , and also comment on George Bush ’ s actions following the September 11 th terrorist attack , and found that the violent US response prompted a chain of uncontrollable events .
After September 11 th , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the path to solving this problem lies in non-violence .
" I know that his motives were good , but he used force , and the consequences have been unexpected , " said the Dalai Lama .
Four Years of Children ’ s Vacco Diseases
Poison control centers in the US report an almost 400-percentage-point increase in the number of children under 12 years of sharply alcoholic hand-infection , the Georgia Poison Center says .
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez , director of the Georgia Poison Center , cases of hand-infection revenues rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014 in children under 12 who report toxic control centers .
" Children increasingly enter these products , and , alas , a percentage goes to the emergency room , " said Lopez CNN .
He said that some children are deliberately drowning disinfectant , while some are doing to impress their friends or to have a mother sample with social media .
YouTube videos show how young people drink disinfectant only because of cheap inheritance .
Youth allegedly have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic screening to obtain a harder drink .
Younger children can be attracted by attractive deserts of disinfectant funds .
" A child doesn ' t think this is bad for it , " Lopez said .
Many of the more attractive ( mobile phone disinfectants ) are those who are parked .
There are disinfectants with earthquakes , wine , and oranges that are very appealing to children .
Trading infections contain alcohol somewhere between 45 % and 95 % alcohol .
Few injectors , especially in small children , can cause alcohol poisoning .
" It is highly concentrated alcohol , " Dr. Stephen Thornton , the medical director at the Kansas University of Kansas City ’ s poison center , told Fox 4 .
So they would not allow a Schluck whisky to fester , but people are letting these phone disinfectants come within reach of children , and if children do so , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
Nhaijah Russell , a six-year-old girl who recently received four transgressions of traders from school deforestation after earthquakes , was taken to an emergency .
Her blood alcohol concentration was in 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legal in an adult , Dr. Chris Ritchey , an emergency doctor who treated her outside the Atlantic at the Gwinnett Medical Center .
Nhaijah slaughtered her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
Doctors monitored them overnight at a separate child ’ s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and breached his head , Ritchey said .
" This was very frightening , " said Ortoria Scott , NhaiYear 's mother , CNN .
It could have been lethal for my child .
Lopez has recommended using parents and teachers to use alcohol free products or disinfectant textbooks and load trades beyond the child ’ s reach .
Beyond alcohol poisoning , some disinfectant drugs involved death .
In 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the flood of merchandise vaccines that contained a toxic , undeclared ingredients .
Health officials suspect that the product contains methanol , a lethal solution , rather than ethylalcohol , listed as a drug .
In January , three New York classics students were planning to poison their “ common ” teacher by poisoning out anti-debacle products around the field , ” says the police report .
The teacher is highly allergic to hands-infection drugs , and expelled them from her room .
The police regarded the veiled plan as a " switch " and expelled disciplinary measures to the school agency .
Three vehicles are damaging villo switches .
In one case , a 33-year-old automobile driver was wounded slightly in a food accident .
A 60-year truck driver was on the crossroads of industrial transportation , embracing too late that two forward-looking vehicles had stopped traffic .
As a result , he campaigned with his truck to the cheque of an audience , weighing that vehicle on an earlier Ford Fiesta .
The police share some $ 1,000 in the insolvent vehicles .
The 33-year-old car was no longer ready and had to be scrapped .
Suspicions : No Dimony at Celtic
Griffith ’ s talk of discord at Celtic Glasgov admits that the Hood is in bad place , but that he will do so once again .
Heart will fight SFA for allegation to Nrusson , and Warburton will be cautious about Youth new commitments that could destroy the Caders ’ unity .
Don ’ s Up to Five Celtic Leadership
ADAM Rooney ’ s parlor meter in the first half of the period gave Aberdeen a slim victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griffith ’ s Talent of Disharmony
There are rumors about disenchantment at Celtic Glasgov , which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths , who insisted that he and his team cameras are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch tobacco leader .
I don ’ t think we feel under pressure ; I think that the players are pleased to do so .
Lack of titles in Scottish football bores the Dutch
Ronald de Boer , a former mid-ranking and national player in the Netherlands , has said that Dutch soccer fans have lost interest in Celtic , because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers .
De Boer , now an ambassador to Ajax , said , " In Holland , they no longer show the Celtic Games at their tenets , and why ? "
It is because the rankers are not there .
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers .
They talk about the old business .
They talk about both teams together , and what they want .
There is a great deal of tension in the Old corporate games , and not only are Scotland ’ s people who want to see them .
I will turn things around , invoke Deila .
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian leader vowed to turn things around .
After the defeat of Malmö and the ensuing departure from the Champions League , defeat against 10 Aberdeen , who are now clearly at the top of the table by five points .
But , as Deila put it , " Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . "
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible .
I know that it is very frustrating , and a lot of people are very , angry , or sad about what is happening .
We feel that way , but we need to go further .
We really need , really , support for Celtic , because it makes players better .
Bringing together is so important .
Warburton Confronts Yar Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago , which suggested that he was haggling for some Yanukovych transfers , Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful in signing new admissions and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox cadre ’ s unity .
The former chief of Brentford said , " The Yemeni transfer window is very different from the window of summer . "
The players coming this summer have the pre-season time to integrate what you saw with our own group in this season .
The team is really good .
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Michu ’ s Celtic Target
The swana storm of Michu , who discusses Celtic during the transfer period , suggests that he could retreat when his contract expires with Swans .
For the past two years , the 29-year-old have been plagued with a troublesome need , and has failed to make a break from Wales this summer .
Hearts on SFA Battle for Numerous ’ s Comments
Hearts led 2 : 1 , when Paterson was sent from the field , then lost 3 : 2 , but the defender 's Red card was later lifted - the third Red card of Collum , which was recalled in eight months .
Neilson remains what he has said , insisting that " I have not questioned integrity , I have not commissioned performance . "
Griffith ’ s Conspiracy of Preventing Tynecasty
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after admitting to have a song with objectionable texts about ex-Heart Gambler Rudi Skacel .
The incident occurred in a Edinburgh Kneipe in the Roseburn of Edinburgh before Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014 .
" It was a Derby , and it was the heat of the moment , " said the storm , and added : " It is safe to say that I will not return to Tynecasty if it is not playing for Celtic Glasgov . "
Tannadice ’ s board of directors is confident in Dundee Fed Management .
Simon Donnelly insists that the Board of Dundee United States still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but understands that decline must end on the playing field .
I think that Stephen Thompson has confidence in us .
We will get the young back on track , " Donnelly said .
McInhappy to " win " from Hamilton .
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his team desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive Liga victory that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the upper end of the cell , thanks to Adam Rooney ’ s Elfeter in the first half .
McInnes said , " There is no team that won all that , in potato games or in leagues that have not won once . "
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole .
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period .
Scotland ’ s 5.9 % unemployment rate was above that of 5.5 % , as the National Statistics Office ( ONS ) showed .
Meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,612,000 .
Scotland 's employment rate fell to 74.0 % over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UCE average of 73.5 % .
The secretary of state for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures , saying , " The long-term government plan laid the groundwork for a stronger economy . "
It is almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
In those 12 months , we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

Why I witness Oklahoma ’ s execution
Sometime later , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is being killed .
If it does , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a viewer galerie in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penentiary when Richard Glossip is executed through the poison injection .
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
The invitation came first in January , when I was shocked , and I agreed .
When the day came closer , I began to fear me .
So why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about capital punishment .
It would offer a unique perspective .
To be sure , journalists are allowed to see executions in the US , and , with more applications available than places , there is a measly lottery to decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media centers from 12 to five .
Those chosen will be watched without emotion .
I can not .
I will sit next to Richard Glossip ’ s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a half hour visit .
I like the Kerl .
We often laugh when we speak .
The prison authorities say that I can ’ t be a witness and a journalist , so I won ’ t be allowed to read a petition and a pen to see what I see .
I just have to try to recall all all all all all the details .
A Oklahoma journalist accused me of abandoning my impartiality .
Here is the lesson .
Tell the story of the detainee how he wants , and you get access .
I complained about her .
She acknowledged that she " could have said better , " but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things I have said and written .
He does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not , even if he did .
I have said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there .
When he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bellware , a reporter at the Huffington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , consider the series of Podcasts that I have done .
I don ’ t want to go back to all the details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent .
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would blame him for being a beneficiary of action .
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And , from this perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim to be genuinely objective .
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessarily .
The man after a firing police hunt is persuaded to get out of the Canning River .
The Canning Vale Policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River .
An attempt by a man of Perth to impose the police was futile when he was in shallow and sumptuous water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to " persuade him soft to return to the shop . "
The Canning Vale police were called a housekeeping incident in Beckenham on Tuesday .
When they discovered the suspects , he tried to escape them to Canning River .
But he did not get too far .
" He was in water - and I don ' t get out , comfort and hol , " Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said .
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about navigating his uniform , so he applied a more reliable tactic - " A Good Policeman " negotiated . "
" Sometimes people do funny things , " said Senior Sergeant Castledine .
Cup football players Ben Cousins offer an unforgiving example .
In 2006 , Cousins had his car in the graves to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
His efforts have been unsuccessful , but inspired indigenous people to plan Ben Cousins Biathlon humorous .
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to play it out and threatens to end the race .
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried last year to install a spy in its stalls and threatened to end the race immediately .
He targeted Stewards and the integrity of Racing Victoria , claiming that she carried out a personal campaign against him with Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a Rennags treatment , the last barrel on Wednesday .
Moody Fairfax Media said that he has always tried to do what is best for the sport , and he found himself in difficult circumstances when he was concerned with the positive test of library , which he can not explain .
He had held himself back 18 months on charges of espionage , and did not want it to be " looking like too big a mourning . "
" I 've said nothing about it , and I 've sat for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that things happen once , " Moody said .
They know that things went on .
Sometimes you respond , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home and sleep well today .
I want to switch around primary , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
If they start to think I don ’ t do so , I should not be more trainers .
I must then ponder what I do with my license .
Before that , Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had attempted to play its game .
" Eighteen months ago , Terror y Bailey , Dayle Brown , and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I are asked to ask - and offered him employment in my stalls to provide information about what I do within my stalls , " Moody said in Racing.com .
They seem to believe that I am a cheating .
If so , they should surely grasp their bouts for having failed to capture me .
Robert Roulston , the chairman of RVL , David Moodie , the acting president of RVL and Bernard Saundry , the RVL ’ s current CEO , were aware and are still aware of this at the time .
Should I believe that it will be personal ?
Has the RVL behaved solemn , perhaps blaming people outside trainers for what is happening in the industry ?
Is I bad for the industry ?
I am so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps people don ’ t think I ’ m .
Perhaps they need to take my license and violate me , and I have no doubt that what I say now makes them think about it .
But I have reached the point where I don ’ t care , and that ’ s sadness .
That makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them , urging them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The trainer ’ s frustrations levels have built up with the long-standing literary investigation of Lidari , and the Late Scratching led to say that he could “ throw his license over the table . ”
Moody , best known by preparing the unwritten master Black Caviar , called the Rennags treatment rule " ridiculous , " after a pack of sleep or tone was picked up on horses debacles that violated the rules .
" It is against the rules of the race . "
I have to assume full responsibility , ” he said .
" One of my staff has mistakenly thrown into a mess .
It could have been that evening yesterday .
It could have been as true all day as it was .
It did , however , have it on Rennesday .
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment on the ballot box , an investigation that was opened up .
It is a joke .
People who adopt these rules know nothing about the horse .
" We all recognize that we need rules , but we have gone too far , " Moody said .
Arrested for Fueling
The police arrested a man on weekend with a cyclist and subsequent bicycle flight in Cobram .
The cyclist was handed to Royal Melbourne Hospital with a helicopter after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley highway .
The police said that the driver continued to drive without stopped helping the wounded driver .
On Monday , a 50-year-old man from Nathalia joined the police in Shepparton .
He is likely to be charged with harassment of drivers and reduced aid , and with other traffic offenses .
The cyclist , a 40-year-old man from Cobram , stays in the hospital , who is in a stable state .
Melbourg ’ s storm trainer Craig Bellamy is returning to rivals for claims of vindication .
Melbour-Storm trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players ' tackling an " agent setting " of two Premier League favorites at the NRL .
Sydney Rootor 's trainer , Trent Robinson , has said that the referees have allowed the “ race fighting " with his team during the high levels of staff victory in Sydney 's skill final in the Friday .
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made an obscure comment on the Storm team after his team won the Final victory against North Quesenland Cowboys on Saturday night . He called the game a " poster example " of the Rugby League , saying that the two Quezine countries were not " good at all . "
Bellamy defended his team 's torch climate , saying that they were focused only on their " contact . "
Bellamy added that criticism of two leading trainers of his team confident him , because it meant that they worried about being beaten by the tribe team .
" That always appears - I have not heard Trent Robinson speak of fingers when they beat us 24 : 2 , " said Bellamy at Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed all of the year from our defensive system or the techniques . But in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus , which has provided the turnaround for us .
Trent has now been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a little shock to him .
It is comical , as always happens this year .
Bellamy has attacked Bennett 's idea of " exciting soccer , " reminding his mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragon won the Premier League with " boring " football " in 2010 .
Wayne speaks of exciting soccer .
He compared his game on Saturday night with our day at the leitday night , and how exciting her game was , " said Bellamy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was criticized as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would deal with a ceiling recess .
But now he has a team that can play , and that we see as exciting , particularly his young players at their speed .
That is the ball game that you want to play if you have this kind of gambler .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all of his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so that they can play like it .
I build greater trust because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about playing against us .
Six weeks ago , they probably did not imagine us when it came to the Big Games .
Bellamy also pointed out that the games against horrors were better than the Broncos game against Cowboys .
The Broncos game was probably a good game , but what was the outcome 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
Or are recessions going unchecked and not points somewhat flinching ?
For me , it is the game changer .
When they mention us , it means that we will meet at a time when they will .
The Storm team has free this weekend , as it has gained the right to receive either North Queen Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks the next Saturday in the precursor in AAMI Park . The ticket sell-out begins tomorrow .
Serbia , with $ 200,000 Cauctions for Drug Affairs
A man who may be life-long punishment risks being released for his attempt to acquire 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to queens was released against a $ 200,000 cage .
Marko Maksimovic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month , after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on Yacht Solay , who came from South America to Vanuatu and started Coomera in August .
Maksimovic was watched as he met his fellow Jachthafe defendants over the previous day , and later in Café Coomera Roadhouse , where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo .
Despite possibly life-long punishment for trying to possess a commercial cocaine , Macsimovic lawyer argued that he did not know that he was trying to possess the entire crowd , and that the café could have been harmless .
The Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned about the threat of escape to Macsimovic .
He has clear relations with Serbia .
He often travels to Serbia , " he told the court on Wednesday .
In a criminal record , he lied to the police about his whereabouts .
Macsimovic ’ s mother and bookstfather had offered a $ 200,000 cauction as collateral to achieve his release .
" After reading the two people 's idiosyncratic explanations , it is clear that it is a true financial burden , " said Judge Flanagan .
But this alone will not stop him from appearing , he warned .
Maksimovic was released from the auction , under the conditions that he abdicated his Australian and Serbian passports , registered with the police daily , and abided by a ban of 18 : 00-06 : 00 .
Accidental A5 at Clause : Caster House Divides
A truck driver was badly injured at the Tuesday service company with three trucks on the highway 5 .
Two of the three involved trucks had stymied before a permanent building site to Basel .
The third driver remarked too late , and tried futile at the last moment , as the police told .
The leader ’ s house of the accident was utterly divided .
The driver was heavily injured into a hospital .
The A5 between the Brother and the Carlsruhean nord was completely blocked for more than six hours to 2 a.m.
It resulted from damage of $ 12,000 .
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to entice pedophile to send pictures .
One educator used the telephone of a 11-year-old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stevan Hogg took the mobile phone that occurred when he entered an online measurement service that gave him a series of unsettled images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl subsequently woken up and discovered that the phone was missing , and found it in the hands of the sleeping hogg .
She saw it through , found the confusing stories , and immediately alarmed her mother .
The police looked after and looked at the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address , and discovered " Web sites " that used terms for unsettled images of children .
Hogg then claimed to be a policeman to civil servants that he did it , because it would lead to " pedophile on the Internet " and then " pretended to be a policeman to frighten them . "
The prosecutor , Eilidh Robertson , told the Dundee Sheriff Court : " he said it would be an addiction - that he was addictive to scaring people off .
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer , but said that he had happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare pedophile .
He was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent the images and asked him to send even more photos .
He said that he did it to entice them .
He said that he was ill in his head when he drowned , saying that he would see pictures of rape and murder .
Ms Robertson added : " When the girl found the news on the telephone , she told her mother and was at the knight and on the wine .
She then also saw the unsettled images on the telephone , confronting the defendants .
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and placards to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
Hogg , 23 , Ward Road , Dundee , was guilty of receiving decent pictures of children on June 14 , having violated the documents on January 25 , and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not look like a register of sexual criminals , because one can argue that " not a significant sexual element " should be found in his offense .
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the ruling ruling until October to receive background reports of social work .
Hogg was given bait in this case , but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases .
He was incorporated into the signing of sexual offenders even before the date of the ruling .
Small Border Mountains to Germany
More and more refugees are being resettled on the side of large-scale controlling points on the German-Austrian border .
Many smugglers , fearful of discovery and detention , raised people to smaller border crossings .
On the Austrian side , a speaker of the federal police said out .
Throughout the Indian border , more than 1,000 refugees have been raised in the countryside of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday .
They had taken root over bridges and pieces to the German side .
There , they are received by federal policemen and run on to register .
On Munich ’ s main frontier , far more refugees arrived at Germany ’ s national police request when compared to the weekend of Mittwednesday .
Up to 800 watch , a speaker said tomorrow , had approximately 700 people in the countryside ’ s capital .
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border , in 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : Excursions of Tropical Tropical " Henry " in southwest .
Meteorists warn of storm furniture in southwest of Mittweet ’ s afternoon .
To the extent that Western Europe is in deep print , the Deutsche weather service ( DWD ) is now pouring into reservoirs .
The strong depth is the expiration of the tropical " Henry , " who has been dragged across the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in recent days .
Hard storms and wildfires are expected , above all , in beads .
According to DWD , until Donor Day is still early-stage in black forest , soils of 60-90 kilometers in the soil cable .
So the sun can be seen again on Friday .
The masses go around : every two years , the IAA ’ s automakers show their newcomers .
In 2015 , the main driver of the pact waves is the movement , which is now particularly well sold .
Compact class cars are especially needed : roughly 28.1 % of new entrants were created in August alone , according to the prime minister ( KBA ) alone .
This is reflected in the IAA ( the publication days of September 7-27 ) .
This year , in particular , many new compact models are introduced between the futuristic conception vehicles and new upper and luxury cars .
One of the greatest prestige for the German car arbiters is the Opel Astra , which will stand with traders in the fall .
" The astra is an extremely important model for us , " said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann .
It is at the core of the brand .
For the volume model to sell itself well , the new astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel offers the prospect of entering the largest competitor , WW Gulf , starting at € 17 ( $ 650 ) .
The current astra costs up to € 16 .
The Astra has a new 1.4 live engine , with 74 kW / 100 PS .
Moreover , the eggs offer more diesel and gasoline engines , ranging from 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / 200 PS , which include three cynical gasoline users for the first time .
Unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a firebuster .
The second variant will be followed by the Commission ’ s spring , which is also evident at the IAA .
And what will be stashed next to the IAA ’ s astrone for new compact exchanges ?
Renault Mégane – Renault is sending in Mégane the fourth generation of Astrai ’ s rival .
In the mass , the Mégane must be seen solely as a fiat in a conventional and an excellent GT version .
It comes in trade early next year , then as a combi .
Infiniti : The infiniti Q30 is all new .
The Nissan offshoot wants the new model to find its position in the highly growing segment .
But the complicated infiniti , with its fake lines , is fully fit into the brand ’ s designer line .
The basic model will have a gasoline engine with an accomplishment of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Suzuki Baleno – New in the segment , too , is the Suzuki Baleno , who celebrates his world premiums in Frankfurt .

DS – Not entirely new , but outright renewal is the compact class-cutterly DS 4 that is seen at the IAA .
Except , the noble Citroć offshooter paid mainly on the frontline game : here the refrigerator was restored and the changed henchmen were equipped with LED technology .
In the interior area , the system of infotainment was modernized , the number of needles were reduced through a touch screen , and first integrated Apples ’ cargo .
Add to that the IAA a series of revisions and new variants , such as the open-ended Mercedes A class and the Peugeot 308 GTI .
JVA Berlin-Tegel : Five square meters of cell are degraded .
The German Constitutional Court has given a former prisoner of the Court of Justice Tegel , who had been subjected for months in a small cell .
Because of their human dignity abuses , detainees have a fundamental claim to financial compensation when placed in small cells .
The German Constitutional Court ruled this in a decision issued on Wednesday .
They can hope for the judges even if they were locked in too close a few days ( Az 1 BvR 127 / 14 ) .
Thus , an ex-detainee has succeeded in Karlsruhe ’ s constitutional complaint : he was subjected to a single cell with around five square meters of land from June to November 2009 , when the toilet was not separated .
After that , the man who , according to his lawyer , has now been reopened to a larger cell .
His imprisonment was failing because of the unworthy terms of detention against the country of Berlin .
But the Constitutional Court upheld Berlin ’ s ruling and rejected the case for renewed scrutiny .
They see men ’ s human dignity violated .
Kammerit Now decides on the scale of compensation .
Although , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation is essential , a counterbalancing claim was said .
Otherwise , " a concern to protect the rights of personality . "
The pool must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
Constitutional judges have often in the past strengthened the rights of prisoners .
For example , it was only in April that they assigned damage to a prisoner because he was naked in a cell .
What is not worthy of human dignity is a 2011 decision that added evidence of a cell without a separate toilet is also worth taking .
Carlsedinejad also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , which was certified by a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
The plaintiffs at the time had been subjected for three months every day between 15-21 hours in the same cell as in the cartels .
The Berlin prisons have also come into the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff .
Prisoners , therefore , are kept in 23 hours , and aggressiveness is rising , even because of strained conditions .
According to the judiciary ’ s blackmail , 21 places in Tegel are not staffed for lack of knowledge ; 19 are due to be removed in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy : " We Create it . "
Immigration is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What ’ s Winning to Germany ?
Some 8,000 asylum-seekers are projected to enter Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb one million refugees .
Facing the unusual challenge , German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated : " I say again and again : we can make it , and we make it . "
What happens to Germany is the following overview .
What is needed , according to different projections , is between 350,000 ( the Federal Department ’ s estimate ) and 4,000 ( the Pestel Institute ’ s estimate ) each year – the next five years .
That is nearly twice the amount that has been built up ( 250,000 homes ) .
But the scarcity of residential housing is especially dramatic , given affordable rental objects : 60,000 to 80,000 rental inhabitants are now out of rental prices , and these particularly favorable homes will seek refugees .
German Minister Barbara Hendrick ( SPD ) wants to double production , from the current € 518 million to one billion .
Far too little , in the Pestel Institute ’ s view , is that 8,000 social housing must be created annually , and that the federal government must invest about 6.4 billion per year .
Some scholars and federal minister are also that there must be more tax advantages for investing in housing .
The Institute for Labor and Labor Research estimates that 55 % of German migrants can be employed in the long run .
But the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them entry , criticized Claudia Walter , the project-management agency for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation .
But integrating refugees is critical to whether they find jobs in Germany .
Labor is the key to social contacts , value-added in the company , but also to the self-esteem of immigrants , says migration researchers Dietrich Thränhart .
In Germany , according to Thränhart , there has been a political turnaround , from prohibiting work for refugees to accepting work .
Whereas there used to be a ban on asylum-seekers from going to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as was the residence requirement , which limits asylum-seekers to a residence base .
In society , the mainstream view - even because of skilled people - has been that refugees should be allowed more quickly to enter the labor market .
A major barrier to access to the labor market is lack of Germany ’ s knowledge .
So far , there is no sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most often delivered through personal contacts .
Building networks is thus , according to Thränhardt , the royal way to integrate labor .
As the Berlin School Administration has found , few eluded parents give their children to the kitas , estimated at 10-15 % : " For the displaced parents , it is important to keep the family together , " says Ilja Coal , speakers for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
To convince the family of Kita ’ s benefits , however , management distributes handtables in different languages .
If female education needs rise sharply through the large numbers of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity , such as by adding more skilled education .
In countries , students are being prepared for learning without Germany ’ s knowledge of will .
But they are not always educated by educated teachers and teachers , but also , as in Berlin , by teachers with only a qualification in German terms .
There is no shortage to them , says Beate Stments of the Berlin School Administration .
The German student work estimates that about 20 % of the refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no Bundesland forbids asylum seekers or patients - the only exception so far Berlin , the interior chancellor Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned his stance .
Study refugees could be relieved of access to higher education .
For refugees with residence permits or acquiescence can no longer receive benefits under the asylum-seekers ’ Law when they start university studies .
The latter , in principle , do not get a bafe , because they do not fall below the ranks of those who are justified .
Patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years to be safe , a margin shortened to 15 months on January 1 , 2016 .
But the funding gap , too , must be closed , demand Steffen Krach , Berlin ’ s state secretary for science , and the German student work .
Students should get fickles right immediately .
Islam will play a more important future role , because many refugees are Muslims , and , for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should succumb to Islam the same rights as they have churches , and develop the existing right to a new state / religious relationship .
It would also be important to establish an Islamic social union that is professionally concerned with newcomers .
The right includes duties .
Thus , Islam ’ s representatives must agree on clear interlocutors and be willing to work with the state in many areas and give it some control .
This includes a willingness to crack down on religious fundamentalism .
On Donbas Day , the head of the Muslim Central Council , Aiman Mazyek , expressed concern that religious conflict could also be spread to Germany .
Those who wanted to extinguish such conflicts in Germany " immediately have their right to " forget " in Germany , he said in Bavaria 's broadcasting .
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic .
Integration in the future will be much more than it is now an issue for all of society .
As a result , a majority society will need to change , reducing discrimination and racism becomes more urgent .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - been an anti-discrimination regulator and a general law for almost a decade .
But it is very slow to learn , as the NSU murders showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
The same opportunity for everyone : what has long called for for by non-white Germans to be a migrant organization and the interest groups , and what has promised to international agreements such as Germany 's anti-racism Convention , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to stay peaceful and to use its new citizens and citizens - for the sake of all .
In general , Germany is able to provide medical services to previously expected refugees , says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
" When it comes to power and capacity , we create it , " he said .
But this requires moving additional money into the system .
To avoid bottlenecks , Montgomery calls for health cards to be imposed on all interrogators alike .
Property benefits could be expected later with the German countries .
In the long run , it is highly questionable to close down so many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum-seeker law envisages .
Otherwise , doctors are doing the most to create the language barrier .
As recently as then , Berlin ’ s health-care scientist Thea Borde has shown , migrants are more likely to be enlightened than other patients .
Not only in clinics , even in drug boxes , need to incur doldrums .
But salaries would also be for many refugees to live with more general medical services in emergency tumult .
And with another diagnostic glance .
Among refugee children , for example , there have been far more untreated disability , and the young are HIV education .
With the partially other pathogens , however , German doctors are aware of their education , says Montgomery .
" Parasite incidents or tuberculosis are not as difficult to discern . " And , when it comes to doctors ' deficiency , they may even have relief in sight . "
The Syrians would have a sophisticated education system , several refugees were even doctors .
To practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications , and perhaps do so again .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill , according to the Bundesh-therapeutic chamber ( BPTK ) estimates : most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression .
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable , Dietrich Munz , President of the BPtK .
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatizing in Germany .
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer , among other things , from so-called firewbacks with respiranot , cheating , heart races , and death fears .
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , severe horrors , and emotional foolishness .
To prevent symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment was necessary , Munz declared .
So far , however , only four % of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy .
While psychiatrically ill asylum-seekers in social services can provide an application for psychotherapy , the procedure usually takes several months .
Moreover , in the social offices , most of them expert workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
This often leads to miscalculations , Munz says .
Sleepwalking to Dreams
With the new imprisonment of " passion , " the Circus Provide reverts to the traditions of circuses .
The aim is to draw every age group into the banner of fascinating acrobatics , animal resurances , and unique entertainment .
Now the Circus Prospery invites the maneuvers on the mirror waves .
" Our passion is the circus . "
“ I can ’ t imagine living without living my circuses ’ family , ” Stephanie Projects , Tibetans , and Juniorchefin says .
" passion " - under this motto - is the current maneerial event .
For more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the family .
So the gift to the enthusiasm is in the family ’ s blood .
" We are important to pull people off their daily stream for two hours in a completely different world , " emphasizing the 27-year-old Juniorchin .
" Manegencocktail with World Staddy Flair , " Director Reinhard Prospery calls his concept .
That lair can now be seen in 50 cities on the 300-mile journey .
The circus program convinces talented artists from around the world .
Significant at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , Russia ’ s Starov Clown Family pulls the audience with widow and charm in their bans .
The castillo Brothers , too , understand their craft .
With the heroes of the movies , the Cuban Duo wants to accept it more loosely .
They identify with these words easily and modestly .
Their humorous art at the heart is intended to conquer women ’ s hearts in the storm .
Except for many salvos , the Circus Prospery acrobatics of the Circus Prosperm is also fascinated with fingerence and supremacy .
Balancing the invasion on a bullet ?
For He Yuan , no problem .
Closure and frighten chapters simultaneously .
Wang Lin China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics , like few others , and fascinated with their mobility .
Sixty employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
" The animals are part of our family , " emphasizes Stephania 's mother , Brigitte Prosperity .
Too often , ills in the attitude of circuses are the subject of various animal-welfare organizations .
Stephanie propagandists also make a point : " Don ' t be good for our animals , don ' t do it well . "
Roughly 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every unit of richness .
The " four-day artists , " as they are loved to be dubbed , are read off by the eyes as if every desire is made .
We want to work with the animals and enjoy enjoyment with them .
If the animal does not bother , nor does it want to be in the maneuver .
So the first imperative is to ensure that animals do well .
In particular , the family is proud of its carroid of Jumbo , a combination of a shetlandPonyhengst and a cedy brown .
The two animals have lived together eight years in a salary , and nothing happened .
" Then , suddenly , was our small jumbo da , " Brigitte Projects tells .
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the maneuvers , but it is the unique mass of the Circus Prosperm .
So , for every visitor , there is likely to be something about it .
" One thing is safe , " says Stephanie Projects : " Whether five or one hundred people , we always do our best and are with a full heart . "
The Circus Prospery invites its notions 17-20 a.m. on September 17 th .
On Sunday , the program begins at 11 to 16 a.m .
Donor Day is Family ; for the idea at 17 a.m. , prices are moderated .
Moreover , every day , the animal strip is open from 10 to 18 a.m .
Zimbabwe ’ s Robert Mugabe Wrong Speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , fell from a podium to the flu earlier this year .
He remained injury , but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media .
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned of accompanied by boots from Mr Mugabe .
Last month , they boosted him and interrupted him in parliament during his State of the Union speech - the speech he reiterated on Tuesday .
The Speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) Movement for Democratic Change Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones , who warned them to disturb Mr. Mugabe ’ s speech .
" The news comes from a number that is not revealed , but it has the title " Death , " he told journalists to Mugabe 's speech .
She warns legislators concerned that immunity will end in parliament , and that once they leave parliament , her parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective .
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is " concerned " about the dangers to politicians .
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its structuring and services-led efforts .
HP will be divided into two listed societies later this year , separating the computer and printing business from its rapidly growing corporate hardware and service industries .
Expected job reductions add up to more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
" These restructurings will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise , " Meg Whitman , HP Chairman , and Chief Executive , said , to lead unity after separation .
" Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , " and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of deals that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , " said Whitman .
As a separate corporation , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy our clients ’ changing needs around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in annual sales and " will be focused on the provision of unmatched , integrated technology solutions for companies , " the company says .
A company established in the 1930 's by Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard graduates to produce electric plants and their palo Alto Garage is called " the birthplace of Silicon Valley . "
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to move from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
The HP ’ s move , the world ’ s second-largest PCO manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that tight-focused companies perform better .
FC Arsenal Chapter Micle Arteta says that teamsters must stand behind the wounded Jack Wilshere in the face of the threat to Dynamo Zagreb .
Less emphasized to Willer that it was only September , and that if his rehabilitation goes out of plan , there is no reason why he can not play again even before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario means that Wilders will surely miss at least the next four Games for England , and , given its history , its participation in the European championship is certainly still uncertain next summer .
The big shame of this current problem is that Wilders had severely ended the last season after separate needle injury , and then returned to his old momentum during the preceding season .
" This type of injury does not threaten the career , " said less .
It is a bone that did not heal well .
This is not a bigger matter .
This was just an accident .
It was not related to his woes , or to the injuries he had before .
This may be true from purely medical perspective , but , however less recognized , there is a risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
It is also developing an awkward pattern .
Prime Minister Injuries Ltd ’ s investigation has identified 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his deforestation six years ago .
He has also played in just 65 of the 157 cigneys in the last five days .
The broader picture for Arsenal is that six out of eight days since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs , which have recorded most of the injuries .
Less accepted the potential of a vicious circle , but arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulnerability rate will continue during the last season .
" Sometimes you will have a vulnerable period , a time when you must strengthen your body and win fighting power , " said less .
Yack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope that his body stabilizes , I am confident that he will do so , and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal begins his champions-League-season season on on the Mittweednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before Chelsea on Saturday , and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wedesday , and less of a rotation within the team .
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia , which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start .
Less can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud , rather than from Neio Monreal and Theo Walcott .
“ I try to maintain the balance , ” said less .
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to go further , the macro-stadium in Zagreb is one of the largest intimidation effects in Europe .
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games that launched the " invincible " campaign in the last season .
The stage was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday ’ s evening , 3.2 of which was measured on the Judges Sala .
This year it was 10 th in Zagreb .
Less believes that Arsenal drew the lesson from last season with Monaco ’ s Champions-League surrender , and remains driven by the distant hope of leading Verein to his first post-European triumph with his management .
" This drive is immense , " said less .
Never before has it hit the arsenal .
We were close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dreamers .
The Comedy Show , which gives us serious lessons about men ’ s friendships ,
The lack of a similar narrative in Shows is obviously more desperate now than ever , especially in view of how the need for men to open up has become even more desperate , as suicide numbers among young men show at a 15-year high .
In 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom , and remains three times more common in men than in women .
In an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Miserably ( CALM ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that when the suffering had enough " healthy mood " , its chances of recovery doubled .
For those who are not depressed , a circle of intellectually sound friends halves the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , one has to have friends so that friendship can work .
In an age of social media communication , with its focus on substance style , the answer is often more important than meaningful contacts .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifelong , and successful , even if isolation really dominates .
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinary values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship , which has a much deeper impact on our mental health .
And , as one video game innovator and billionaire recently said , money really can not buy luck .
The beautiful thing at Friends was that this focus was turned on its head .
Any character was defined not by its work , but by its personality , which shined through the interaction as friend .
The humor of Joey and Chandler 's frequent embrace , moments in the football guards in fatigues , and the yearning of Ross for Rachel -- all of this came from the knowledge that men can naturally draw on , even if they often hold back , to fully explore their feelings .
As a telephone care worker told me , “ my audience role for people who feel depressed and are vulnerable to murder really made me see how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . ”
The men who contacts us often feel unable to talk to friends .
The old saying , " I 'm right , " has a huge impact , as does a sense that it is perceived to be weakness when talking about problems openly . "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms .
It clearly represents the small moments of men ’ s friendships .
However much my objective outsider status over the phone may help people at the moment of despair , long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so when you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friend Fest to celebrate the day , you don ’ t take your friends to a drink in Central Perk .
Or , better yet , in Starbuck alone , let him smile and say Hallo .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends are donated to Comedy Central from the outset to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for Friendsest Fest .
Di Maria meets to help PSG certify Malmö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his meeting against Malmö .
Di Maria meets his debacle at the Champions League in Tuesday and helps PSG get ahead of Malmö .
Here are the report of the game and the response to it .
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani stayed the course when Paris Saint Gerhard began his Champions ’ League season with a highly combustible 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Parcadiston in Tuesday .
Di Maria met less than four minutes after launching its champion League Debüt as a PSGP player who brought the French champion down , but then missed a series of occasions before it finally stepped up its lead when Cavani achieved a headscarf ballot in the 61st minute .
With Real Madrid and Scheijor Donezk in the Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions by seeking not only the qualification for K. O.C rounds , but by improving the way to quarterly finals in each of the last three campaigns .
But , while they received the point , it was not a cabal pile of Laurent Blank ’ s team that was missed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic ’ s missed opportunities , who was later in the game of his home store team and the club that began his illustration career in 1999 .
" It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , create and relax our adversaries , even if there are certain things we still need to perfect in the season , " said Blanc .
" This is a good sign .
We wanted to win and we won , though I regret that we have not yet reached one or two other goals . "
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury to one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold a 2 : 2 % decision on weekend in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was outsourced by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
The Argentine river was called the man who can take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United States last month , indicating why , when he stepped into the long corner of the network in Marco Verrattis Pass behind Malmeter ’ s defense before finishing Johan Wiland .
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic beating in a Play to achieve this stage , joined the field with nine national players , and was a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of the area a tough opponent .
But , apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic that went far ahead with Kevin Trappi ’ s pasts in the 34th minute , they offered little to attack .
Instead , PSG itself sometimes surrendered , with some missteps and bad statements , not least from Ibrahimovic , who was patched in the first half and then abandoned for as little as five attempts alone , after Cavani began his reset .
Nevertheless , he showed much more skill when he brought his co-players into play , and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic , who turned Di Maria into a hub steered by Wiland in the 52nd minute forward ...
The second goal finally fell short of Cavani ’ s Stund brand , with the Uruguayans hitting his sixth seasontor after Ibrahimovic fished a leftist flanke of Maxwell .
That ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wiland , from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz , could keep the end result low before former player Ezequiel Lavezzi was detected in the end .
The trainer of Malmö , Age Hareide , later admitted that PSG played a class above its team , and the Norwegian said , " Our last champions-League game was last December last .
Since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which has not had the same level .
The skills game is not enough . "
Hut before Paris !
It was a great game of them !

The White House Confirms Xi Jinping in Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a US state visit late this month , confirming the White House in a statement at the Tuesday .
Xi ’ s first official visit to Washington is taking place on September 25 , and President Barack Obama ’ s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .

Xavi : Pep Guardiola prevented change in 2008 to the FC Bavaria
World and European champions Xavi have been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015 .
Obviously , the FC Bavi was on the verge of committing Spain ’ s superstar Xavi , who was then playing for the FC Barcelona .
Eight times Spanish champions , three times political winners , four times Champions-League winners , two times Club World Cup champions , twice a World Cup champion , the title of Xavi is breathtaking .
In the summer , after 24 years of age 24 , the FC left Barcelona and changed to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar .
But , in an interview with Marca , Xavi is now saying that he was already before the EM left Barcelona in 2008 .
" I was told that Barça wanted to sell me . "
" Madrid won everything we did , " he tells .
And so did the FC Bavaria .
Xavi : " There was an offer of Bavaria . "
" Romanians wanted me . "
Memory : In the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bavaria .
Guardia was the reason that Xavi did not change .
The change was not made .
And the crucial man is now working for the German record master : Pep Guardiola .
Xavi explains why , " Barça has taken Guardiola under contract , and I played a great EM . "
" Pep told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . "
" He has enraged me . "
Who knows how Bayerni ’ s 2008 / 2009 Games would have gone with Xavi .
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champion ’ s League against Bavaria throughout the distance on the lawn , switched the Red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) , and eventually celebrated the Queen Classical Triumph .
Matt Damon Plays Diversity
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker , efficient Brown , in a discussion of diversity , saying that she was not needed behind the scenes .
During a succession of Sunday Night von HBOs ’ Project Greenlight , the seasoned actor Brown underscored the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagonist in the project ’ s elected script .
" When we talk about diversity , do so in the film 's occupation , not in the occupation of the show , " assuring Damon .
Brown responded with bewildered disbelief , calling " Hoo ! Wow , " when comments by the actor of The Martian consolidated itself .
Damon and Brown joined the producer Ben Affleck and the Farrely brothers to discuss the Show-Finalists .
“ I want to ask people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the Harmony character , ” Brown first said .
The only black person , and she is a commodity beaten by her white layer .

After the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon ’ s comments .

The tweet earned more than 5,000 reviews and 4,000 Likes since it was published .
Damon ’ s comments come at a time when accurate rately racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate .
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014 , the Black Lives Matter movement proceeded nationally , urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against black people .
In February , the singer Prince referred to the movement during the introduction of the year ’ s nominated old at the Grammy Awards .
" Album silent , " he said .
Like books and black lives , old people still have their meaning .
More recently , leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have issued a statement in response to the question of the Elisabeth Hasselbeck , the Fox News-News-personality , whether the group should be considered a Hassi group .
" The Black Lives Matter network is a favorite group , " the leaders said .
Recently , it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers , producers , and media mogules invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West .
Whether he has invaded or already hit the Pope is unclear .
American Ninja Warrior \ u0027s Crony Champion
Professional sports growers and Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday to take home the Great Prize of $ 1 million .
The competitiveness show that just completed its 7th season had never seen a competitor who could complete all stages of his obstacles .
During the Saisonfinal , two men , Caldiero and Cameroon Geoff Britten , managed to enter the final .
The final task was to include the glacier on a 75 foot in 30 seconds .
Third , the task ended within time , which was the first athlete to finish the stressful 4 American Ninja Warrior period . But Caldiero ended this challenge at a full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Caldiero spoke to E ! News after the hard-won victory , still under the shock of winning the Great Prize of $ 1 million .
" I think it is astonishing to think about , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 , " said Isaac .
As suddenly as I can not even imagine how that is … the future is unknown .
The senior producer , Kent Weed , has joined The Hollywood Reporters to discuss the final , and why , although Britons do not get some prize money , even though they first ended the Parcours at all .
Under the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
" When there is more than one Finalist , it receives the fastest time , " said Weed .
How much money is a wonderful price , and how much life it changes , will receive the great credit ratification .
I do not believe that he is harassing some resentment .
He has just done what he has done .
Masses of labels received him from fans .
He is such a good guy and a family father .
He is a hero to his children and wife .
As I put it to me , " If I should be beaten by someone , I am happy that it is Isaac . "
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had replaced the roles .
America has been lengthened to Ninja Warrior for an astute staffle , which the Dream workers will start in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tigers Stop Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half of the season was not very revealing to Detroit Tigers .
Once one of the best teams in Baseball , the Tigers are now in the American League ’ s last place .
The Tigers have been reduced to their roles as a moiler , but , on Tuesday , they played perfectly against Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field .
The Twins wasted a chance to rise up within a game changer of Houston Astros ’ s second American League of Wildcard Square .
For Detroit , if only for a evening , it was a return of the three letter F-word , which was so difficult to capture for much of the second half of the season .
" All victories make sense , no matter how it comes , " Tiger 's managers , Brad Ausmus , said .
Tiger Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit took three times in the first two Innings , then again in the sixth and then back down .
Simon ( 13-9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Innings , allowing three Run .
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
" I want to put an end to this year , " Simon said .
It is hard to throw every game in the bullets , and so I want to go decisively to the game .
The president-elect Victor Martinez was three speakers , and was in two RBIs , his first since mid-August .
It was Martinez ’ s first three-heat game since he had four Hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
" He made the bogeyman well , " he said Ausm .
He looked good at ( bottom training ) , looked far better in the bullbox , and he brought it into direct play .
With three of us in the backyard at the end of the seventh Intel , the Twins had their best chance to return to the game .
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the instruction with one double on the left line .
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a beach , and Simon replaced his second Baseman Brian Dozier before replacing him with the leftist Blaine Hardy .
Hardy overran the wall , the only man he was confronted , before the president-elect Miguel Sano , who sacked a Two-Run from the leader Drew Verhail .
With a couple of vendors and the final run at the second , the third Baseman Tream Plouffe brought the third lease to a Double Play .
It was the 27 th season in the Major League that Plouffe beat a Double Play .
After Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the New Insurance , the Wall created a RBI double line against the Closer of Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached a level of 5-4 .
But at three Pitches , the Court stood for its fifth save .
Detroit benefited from a non-motive Phil Hughes to play the game .
The Tigers reached three rings in the first two Insurances against the Court ’ s Changing Veteran , who had been removed from the most vulnerable after missing more than a month because of a backslide .
" Obviously not the beginning I wanted , " said Hughes , " but I felt more inhabitant than I set out and felt that I would create some fairly good jokes in third instruction . "
Having received the Leadoff-Batter first , Hushes gave up a single of Second Baseman Ian Kinsler .
A Two-Out Walk for J. D. Martinez brought in Victor Martinez , who created a single " up the middle " in the game 's first run .
Victor Martinez made his 20-21 success series with the ranks in the scoring position .
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos , followed by a single right , created another run on the right , but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , ending the threat .
The Tigers added in the second , reaching an Out Out Double of Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single of Center-Fielder Anthony Gose at 3-0 .
" This was a big blow , " said Paul Molitor , Twinson 's managers .
He did not do very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count , but made no points in third , before being replaced by A. J. A. Reliever .
In Hughes , there were three Run ’ s six Hits and one forest with four strings .
ANMERKUNGEN – Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez differed because of a violation of the culprits .
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews , who operated the shoulders of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , the most vulnerable to a school ruling since mid-August , has been activated for starting on Wednesday .
With Sanchez out of the game , LHP Daniel Morris will be slashed by the injured list to launch the Twins .
Norris , 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30 .
Since August 20 , he has lacked a barrier to right-wing hip .
The Tigers and Twins will end their series of three Games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris ( 2-2.4,43 ERA ) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana ( 5-4 , 4,73 ) .
Hundreds of Refugees are Reaching in Viesbades
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to honeymoon .
His arrival was expected on Wednesday ’ s night .
The people who would be most likely to be subjected to emergency articles in Viesbades , as the city of Viesbades told at the Tuesday .
It expected 450 to 750 refugees .
Several national capital athletes had been prepared for this case in recent days .
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily displaced .
They should then be redistributed across other municipalities .
In the last ten days alone , 7500 people had , according to the first-time government presidium , eat at .
Likewise , Frankfurt and Hanau have created shelter in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
The German Military Action in Syria
Wolfgang Ischinger , the head of the Munich Security Conference , considers military action with German participation in Syria a possibility .
" I believe that strong thinking about military action can not happen without Germany , " he said .
He accused the European states of " collective views . "
Four years ago , it was happy that the celch of military participation in Germany was preceded .
" Now the conflict is scratching off our doorstep , " he said in Germany 's landscape .
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in local international aid for refugees .
Austria Controls Southern and Eastern Limits
After Germany , Austria , too , has restored controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Micl-Senior explained at the Tuesday meeting in the Austrian TV station ORF that no one is being returned to Hungary now .
Nor did Germany send refugees back to Austria .
" No , it is so agreed , " she declared .
When asked about an agreement whereby Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks between Germany ’ s Director-General for Public Security and Representative General .
It did not call it concrete , and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
In recent days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route .
Their goal is mostly Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian counterpart , Werner Faymann , called for a special summit next week alongside several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
The EU ’ s member states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
The EU ’ s interior ministers want a new effort to connect another 120 ,000 refugees in the next Tuesday ( September 22 th ) .
Given Germany ’ s strong refugee scandal , the federal government wants more support in absorbing and distributing its people .
The federation will manage this with the countries , and Merkel later announced , at the end of the service , almost four consecutive deliberations with Prime Minister in Berlin .
Merkel emphasized that the people needed to protect would get it .
But those with no boat perspective can not remain in Germany , either .
This view was strongly divided in the round .
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now undertake a " huge power effort . "
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia at the night of Tuesday .
A few hours later , in Budapest , the government announced that it would close its border with Romania with a fence as well .
This neighbor belongs to the EU differently from Serbia .
Hungary wants to prevent cheating routes from seeking Romania , and Hungary ’ s foreign minister , Peter Szijarto , told the planned new border fence .
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
There were initial arrests of people who had averaged the fence .
Meanwhile , in Turkey , eyewitnesses report that thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border .
Spacecraft " Cassini " finds oceans on Saturnmond Encelade
A global ocean spills beneath the egg of the Saturnmond Encelade .
This excludes researchers from observations of " cassini . "
Thus , the moon is easily on its way around the ringplanes .
While this tug-of-war movement is only small , it is too big for a steadfast heavier villain , it is said in a service department from the Cornelli University in Ithaca , the US state of New York .
Researchers present their analyses in the " Icarus " platform .
Long known , there must be liquid water under the Encelade ice ceiling .
For example , in 2006 , " cassini " had discovered Iron Volcane on the southern monopoly of the Saturnon , feeding water vapor iron titles , thereby feeding the so-called e-ring of the Saturn .
At least in the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronomers closed at the time .
But the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
Rama ’ s 1860 Munich lacks several weeks
The 1860 Munich must renounce Valdet Rama , roughly a month .
An inquiry with 27-year-olds of adduciary broke the club .
Rama had already indicted pain early in the week .
According to Munich lions , diagnosis means " presumably four weeks of forced recess . "
" That 's hard for us , Rama is a great loss . "
" Of course , we must think now , " said Necat AyGün , the " image " newspaper , looking at the potential commitment of a unitary profession .
But , as a training moment , the 1960 's first presented a defensive man .
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium , and previously was under contract with the VL Wolfburg .
The Croat now has " the ability to prove its prowess . "
Torjäer Rubin Okotie can return to team education after his brain shaking next week .
The Austrian national player is said to be entering the train .
Okotie had been wounded in a fierce clash at Fortuna Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 : 3 ) .
In contrast to initial fears , he remained without a severe blessinger .
No Disease Fruit Mangos contain Much Sugar
Mangos are exotic and sanguine .
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line will often be more off .
For Mangos contains relatively much sugar - especially check .
Yet healthy are the exotic fruits : in them , B-vitamins , and the vitamins of E and C. , above all , Mangos contains much vitamin A and its precursor , Beta Carotin .
Those eating fruit thus support gravity , immune systems , and metabolic processes in the body .
Mangos should not be too soft or too firm to buy and comfortable .
The color is not alone about how mature fruit is - so green mangos can taste very empty .
They should be store for and eaten in a matter of just a few days .
Then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet memory .
But Mango also gives a special note to arcane courts .
It ameliorates the slightly bitter taste of letters like Chicoree and Radiccio .
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish , poultry , lambs , and wild .
UPS provides up to 95,000 aid for the US business of Christmas .
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers , telling UPS on Tuesday .
drivers , in particular , are looking .
Last year , UPS increased its workshop for the holiday season by 95,000 .
Given the booming online business , UPS and its competitor , FedEx , have been making precautions since last year in order to win for the Christmas business .
In 2013 , belated supplies had harshly criticized the parcel service .
The Strong Line
Next night , the valleys of the alphabet side of the height , as Meteotacz told the Tuesday .
On Wednesday and the night of Donor Day , the height stems in part from soil strength .
At the height of the Donbas Day tomorrow , we are crossing a distinctive cold front that will cause major rains , wind turbines , and temperature declines .
As Meteonews points out in a division , Switzerland is now on the eve of a large low-pressure area across the British islands in a strong South West Caucasus .
On the altar side , the night will be the midwildlife of the valley by the valleys .
As a result , the height up to Donbas tomorrow in the soils of 60-100 kilometers / h , combined , and partly with more than 100 kilometers / h in the uranium country in particular .
The level can move decisively to adjacent organs , and even orkanes of more than 120 kilometers / h are possible in the mountains .
Whereas the north worries about summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the firestorm on the alpedgy South is beginning to replace it .
Here , rains continue until Thursday .
Together , over the next 48 hours , the alpes need to be expected , in part , by more than 100 liters per square meter , after large volumes of rainfall have fallen in recent days .
On Thursday days tomorrow , the height is running out of thin air , with a cold front , with strong , partially determined rains from West to East through Switzerland .
Together with the cold front , wind rises sharply to storm levels , and temperatures are falling sharply .
The following days are vigorous in the north , 15-20 degrees , but in the south it will sunk and warmer by up to 25 degrees on weekends .
Rome ’ s March Later Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation , Martin LutherSquare is now in Rome .
In the presence of city President Ignazio Marino , an unprecedented place in the park on the Oppio hill was taken on behalf of the German reformer .
On the " Piazza Martin Lutero , " he is now recognized as a " German theologian of reformation . "
In the midst of the old Rome , the park is the same alongside the Colossus .
The names had been requested by the Australian churches ’ working community in Rome .
Jens-Martin Kruse , a pawn of the Evangelian-Lutheric community in Rome , was a reminder of Mittwednesday that for centuries , Protestants in the city of the Peses could often live only in hidden faith .
The spot symbolically demonstrates that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 1483-1546 ) held up in Rome a few months as a young Augustine holiday .
He then saw the city as a missed scapegoat .
His negative impressions may have reinforced him , in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then , with his creed against the despotic trade , had begun dividing the end-Dutch Church .
Three years of Hammer artists invested in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( golden ) village crown is one of the main works Otmar Alt has observed for his bible .
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction , updating biblical texts .
At the start , was the word ?
No , not the Otmar-Alt Bible , which has now appeared with exemplary images .
At the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt , who in 150 motives formulated his entirely personal interpretations of biblical narratives on paper and inquiry .
Its " language " with colorful colors and unimaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-olds , which is by no means synonymous with " virtuous " images .
On the contrary , it can be quite bleak about each issue .
Roughly three years , Otmar Alt worked on his Bibelong Project , which made a subjective artistic choice from the many themes of the " Book of All Book . "
What arose are cycles that address issues such as crusades , suits , bids , or fatherways .
He spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true of the Luther-Lutheri lag , with its theological orientation , as well as of the Cettler lag , with its focus on art books .
And there , above all , is the author Klaus Altepost , who has grappled with the biblical issues based on malaria .
He interpreted the biblical offices chosen by Otmar Alt , thus translating into " current contexts . "
These texts are like verbal mirror of old Malpathy .
They are embedded between Martin Luther ’ s Original Bishop and one of the artists ’ phrase that formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
The smuggling band has golden leagues .
Indeed , the 75-year-old permit a deep glimpse in his soul , his emotions .
This is a high degree of intimacy .
Emotions were , after all , a trigger for the Bibelum Project : Otmar Alt , born in advertisers in 1940 , and grown up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant master hud .
" With education before the royal stock , " Otmar Alt recalls .
" I have tried to work on this , perhaps again with the master of father . "
Its second concern is to regain the art ’ s weight in rapid times : “ The perception of images is now shaped by records , and that is loud .
Symbolic is displaced .
Artists have a different appetite for doing things .
Images always have some mystery and are not deceptive .
" Here I am a dinosaur . "
Otmar Alt wants viewers to be invaded into images of " they can be invented , discover , and feel what strength they have : " The image looks like its counterpart . "
Klaus Altepost was on Tuesday 's portrayal of Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation , " always a favorite of Otmar Alt 's art : " I may see how he lives with his images . "
He did not respect the Bible entirely , but chose the important , even mysterious , issues that he considered .
" This was not a collaboration on ear , " he says : " It is about images of the text that explain only " .
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-in-exile , this work is an invitation to " deepen his life and find freedom . "
Otmar Alt ’ s images speak for heirs both the ( Biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
Part of the original original paper and instructor is first presented in an exhibition opened in the Otmar-Alt Foundation on November 15 .
Beginning the BMR Road
Plans were made , found to hire companies , and to model bottlenecks for a roundtable : almost everything was finished a year later – but it was already coming to an end even before the official opening of the BMR railway .
Failures in political and administrative systems incited intimidation , especially among residents who did not want to patient the railway .
So it is hiding , looking for new space - with formal planning and application for construction .
Allegation would arrive in October , the first woman , Sabine Mosebach-Bock , could now tell the children and teenage committee .
" I hope that this year 's visibility happens , " she said .
It should then be started in the work of the former hallenbad without " more records . "
DFB Increases Refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundesgota sets a clear sign on weekend .
Football responds to Germany ’ s worsening situation , and is securing its help in dealing with the problems ahead .
" I think this is our country 's greatest challenge since reunification . "
" Because no one can say in principle that I don ' t think I have nothing to do with it . "
" That needs to interest every individual in controlling this issue , " said DFB Chairman Wolfgang Niersbach .
At an annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he wants to debate the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
“ I am next Wednesday in the post of Chancellor , and I hope the Secretary of State Ezoğuz and the Chancellor . "
" Because the issue will surely play a central role , " he announced .
Football can and does want to help .
But politics must set the critical course .
Thus , the German soccer ball ball has extended its “ 1 : 0 for a will ” initiative by four years .
" Over the Egidi Braun-Braunn Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue by 2019 , " declared Nierbach at the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian / Malta .
Some federalists also support the program .
Earlier this weekend , 36 profiles make a clear sign that they will " help us " we - hideously - share the left-wing gimmills , rather than the usual sponsorship logos . "
" We also want to make it clear that everyone should help to wherever and how to " , " Leale 's chief , Rudi birller , said the " image " of the newspaper ( Tuesday ) , calling it " self-comprehensibility . "
" The refugee drama goes to everyone " no one can be seen away . "
" We can not , no , " says Michael Preetz , " use our radiation , influence , and ability to help the many refugees who have suffered so much unbelievable . "
Hard CEO Peter Return referred to a " prominent sign of the League . "
As a EMR match against Hungary on this Friday , women ’ s national team invites 100 refugees to Hall / Saale .
Nightmare called the support of refugees " a great community of German soccer . "
That all 36 licenses had started their own projects in their places was great .
So great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
The message " 1 : 0 for a will " that we have spent is lived in football .
" This is of enormous importance , " he said .
In this year and next , the association with the DFB selection and the federal government is allocating € 30,000 ( $ 3,000 ) annually to integrate refugees .
" The clubs have also called all the money for 2015 , " reported nightmare .
Reports : SAP Chief Executive Unsurprisingly
The chief executive of Europe ’ s largest software company , Bill McDermott , has reportedly lost the left eye by overthrowing in early July .
In the accident at his brother 's home in the US , he had fallen to a water glass that he has taken to the left , the " economic week " on Wednesday .
" He almost burned , " was poignant , then slashed into the street -- he told us so last week , " quotes the " WiWo " of the SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner .
But McDermott can do his job .
" In early October , we will meet before the board meeting in Walldorf , " said Plattner .
The 54 year-old manager is " fully workable " at the meeting .
McDermott announced in an interview with the " Southern German newspaper " ( Donbas ) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to run the software company .
" I am replete with SAP , full of my job . "
" Of course , I have been in regular contact all the time with the board and its chairman , Hasso Plattner , " said McDermott the " SCO . "
McDermott usually cheers between Germany and the US , but since the summer he has not been at the German SAP ’ s headquarters in Walldorf .
He said that it is important to publish such a personal story , said the " SCO 's managers " : " Everyone can happen . "
" It is important to reappear when you have fallen . "
McLarge Expeditionary Magnussen
Magnussen tweeted the same photograph , declaring that he suffered the injury when he was overthrown .
So it does not qualify as a reserve driver of Singapore ’ s two tribal pilots , Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button , as it did a week later at the Great Prize of Japan .
Football : BVB without Reus Against Krasnodar : Christmas Fellers in the Gate
In Borussia Dortmund , all hopes for a Marco Reus comeback have finally shattered in the European League ’ s first game of group .
The national player will also lack the tabloid tobacco leader in the Duell with the FK Krasnodar on Donbas Day ( 19.00 watch / sky ) .
" Unfortunately , we can not draw on him , " Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday .
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Federal Topgame against Lee , the BVB coach made it open : " We expect a return from him to trained on Friday . "
Given the heavy burden on his professionals , Tuchel will not just change his tribal position .
Thus , he announced a change in the brain position .
As a result , Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of tribal strategists Roman Bureau .
" He is training at an absolute top level , " the football teacher praised the world champion .
But Tuchel left an open question of whether white-collar games are used in the future in all European League Games .
In all likelihood , he will also deny the second game .
The forthcoming words of Mitambassador Reus that the final entry into the BVB must be the target in the European League shows that median players Julian Weigl " This doesn ' t make Marco so wrong . "
" I think we have a good chance to break the title . "
Robotic : Government Wants to Leadership for Germany
Germany is said to be the government ’ s will to change the automobile ’ s technological frontier .
On Wednesday , Germany ’ s German government decided on Wednesday to adopt a policy paper made by Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt ( CSU ) , which includes investments in developing digital infrastructure .
Dobrindt spoke at Frankfurt 's Wednesday on the verge of the IAA 's automobile of a " new age of mobility . "
Automated and interconnected drivers would enhance traffic safety and reduce traffic jams , Dobrindt said .
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries , who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA .
The transport ministry ’ s strategic paper , among other things , stresses the importance of mobile broadband and a rapid shift to digital hearing .
The testing of new technologies is now producing a test route on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
In order to " not to impose additional liability risks on the driver , " the German government wants to review the legal environment , " and to adjust the new developments where necessary . "
For example , Germany wants to make an international effort to raise the permissible speed of self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers .
The German government also wants to change the Vienna Agreement , which only people so far have deemed to be drivers .
As automated driving grows , the automobile takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
Technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras who capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated highways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Nevertheless , driverless public-sector vehicles are " to be expected well after 2020 . "
Adding value to highways and highly automated drivers at the site of Germany , the study ’ s authors estimate that the study will be around € 8.4 billion in 2025 .
" The digital interconnectedness of the Pew can lead to greater security and efficiency in the road transportation , " said the SPD traffic politician Saint Bartol .
But the question of liability for accidents and security of drivers ’ personal data must be clearly clarified .
But Germans still view self-driving cars – far more than French or American .
A study presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Force Institute for the Study Dekra Review Survey found that only 8 % of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , with 32 % not even believing in 20 years .
In France , 21 % of respondents expect automobiles to drive autonomously by 2025 , compared to 33 % in the US .
In any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle .
After an elevation of the Bitkom Digital Association , only seven % would agree to hand over control throughout the road .
On the highway , the fluid flow could account for 15 % of the total , 45 % in the season .
Wellingly anyone in four would be left to control the car in no circumstances .
Boll tells Team and Double Start in Tibetan EM
The villain wants only to set in stone after the front battle of September 25-4 .
The final decision is to be made late on September 22 .
" This is a huge loss for our team . "
" The young know it tomorrow . "
" But we are strong enough to get the title right without Timo , " said Bundestrain Jörg Roshead during the EMR teacher in Düsseldorf .
Boll was on the run at the time of a long-term sponsorship mament in China .
The 34 year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
" Without Timo , the downside is now ; we are no longer so clear a favorite , " declared single European champion Dimitrij Ovtarov .
But the Hamelner who leads the Yekaterinburg slaughter was also reminded of the EM in 2013 .
" At that time , too , Timo has lacked , and we have become European champions . "
" We should take care of this , " the World Cup Fifth Fifth declared .
The English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has gravely violated the right .
At the champions-League game at the PSV , the defender was hit in a héctor Moreno Tackling and changed after long treatment .
The first diagnosis suggested that the 20-year-old player at Bastian Pig , who was a one-size-fits-all call .
Gauller feels Too Old for an Enfant terrible
It is a combination of very large fashion showmanners and a guard grandparents ’ cabinet : Designer Jean Paul Gaultier ( 63 ) made an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
The bottom points are that surcharges that look terribly human , thanks to video projections .
They are wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became a great star of fashion censorship with Madonna 's peasantry - and thus of men stuck in rocks .
" I no longer can say that I am the grandfather of terrible skin casure because I have white hair . "
" It used to be easy ; now it is real , " Gauller said .
For visitors to the " From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk " ( from the Bourgeois ) edition of September 18 th seen in the dunthals of mortgage station , it is a lucky luck that the Modetain has altered his initially opposing stance on a show of personality .
He was opposed , because , " For me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , " he said .
When you die , you go to the museum .
The impressive collection had already stalled in the Canadian Montreal and Paris .
" It 's all that more than beautiful clothes , " said Kunthals Director Roger Dieder .
It is about tolerance , acceptance , and vision of an open society .
The exhibitions provide a glimpse into the almost overarching work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completing an education .
Chronologically , the screen is not built , but it is an excellently choreographized overall reworks for which much effort has been devoted : in order to freeze the buyers , for example , a stylist was hired on its own .
14 tons of material have crippled machines to Munich , according to the Kurator Thierry maxime Loriot .
Shortly before the start of the October deadlock , a special manager was involved : a liver hose outfit with corn .
Heidi meets Madonna .
He has always interested in strong women ( “ Women are cleaner than men ” ) and said Gauller for people who are a bit different .
Gaultiers old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition .
He stands for the first , timid , tentative salary attempts made by the designer .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he had attracted his Teddy BHs and Clothes , Gauller said .
Playing with a buff would not have allowed his parents to play him .
Then he set himself up for fashion .
He stole fashion magazines and watched other designers ’ drafts , as Gauller told Munich .
Later , I bought it , of course .
For his first mode show , he could not have paid the model .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the shamots .
The Mode-Niche Boy
Previously , the long nitrogen machines were involved in making meter .
The deterred materials and peers arose in a great deal for customers who , for example , reprocessed them to cover and check .
Today , that alone no longer works , explains Andreas Reinhardt , the leader of Modespitze .
Instead , the fashion is important again .
In the early days of the Plaughter ’ s top , fashion played a larger role , then was crowded out by the domestic textile industry – and is now rediscovered as a kidney .
Reinhart calls a few examples : top in smuggling , Accessoires like pockets , and regional trains .
Overhead is an increasing potential for contract .
Those who do not consume kidneys in the textile industry in Germany are no longer in the market .
We already have half of all contracts .
Modespitze ’ s passports , together with nine other companies , are a member of the industry ’ s plateau and nitrogen .
Only they can bear the protective label .
Over the last 15 years , roughly 80 % of sales have broken away .
Private professionals and big trade are almost absent .
Our products barely reach customers on this path .
Today , mass commodities are produced much more cheaply in the Asian space , almost exclusively through cats .
Moreover , exports are weakening , now to Russia and the US .
So there are reasons for new paths .
The Industrial Association is also trying to emphasize environmental sensitivity , as Falkenstein 's Cordula Peasants explained from the Falkenstein nitrogen : " Since this year , we have run a qualified seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially tolerable . "
In addition , " This applies to the materials used . "
Diplomats Ute Schmidt teaches at the snowberger foreign office of the Western Semitic seminary Zwickau - at the faculty of used art - and specializes in nitrogen seeds and spies .
To counter competition from Asia , we need to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
A tension arises between the designer ’ s most freshly ideas and those who must think most economically , ” says Schmidt .
That is why an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a consumer ’ s ancestor .
A few years ago , the textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical Ponzi ballots .
Yet the machine stalls small kitchen in some places .
" Before I couldn ' t start with traditional plaintiffs . "
Now it is using the snowball squad for its smuggling .
In an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
" Many people in the region identify with the theme of plunder leaders - young and old , " Reuters says .
It also delivers to the US , Australia , and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in packs and surroundings , who want to remember .
I see my courage as a modern ambassador to the Plenty ’ s top .
Disney is planning New “ Mary Poppins ”
They don ' t boast levees , but Disney is nonetheless daring to find a new film by his classic " Mary Poppin . "
According to " Entertainment Weekly , " however , this is not a refiling story , but a kind of sequel that plays with the magic nanny 20 years after the first film .
It is about the Nanny experience with the banking family in times of the Great Depression in England .
Those who play Poppin more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are unclear .
But the director is already clear : whether Marshall , most recently with the " Into the Woods " in childo .
Xi urges the broader Global Economy
The economy needs to open up more broadly to support growth , said President Xi Jinping at the Tuesday of a group tasked with managing reform .
" China should lobby for attracting foreign investment and know-how to improve business strategies , " he said in a speech at the 16th Meetings of the Central Leadership Group for the deepening of Comprehensive Reform .
Encouraging start-up and promoting reform will bring new momentum and vitality to the table , and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said .

Following the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and businesses that are unchallenged for investment .
The system is gradually being tested and improved through testing programs .
The initiative is important , because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources , ensuring a legal business environment , and open the market , said the stature .
The government will also relax controls on the powers levied to companies , ensuring that companies decide how to run their business .
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors , more areas are being opened for private investment .
" The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them , " said the statement .
Moreover , it is made it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimizing demand and facilitating the recruitment process .
The lawyers ’ right to guarantee their work and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting .
At the meeting , Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli participated , as was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
The EU Hits to Double Quiet
The European Commission wants to double the threshold for mercury in large pockets , thereby encouraging consumers to accept a much higher dose of nervous poisoning .
The EU ’ s Consumer Foodwatch Organization , which is subject to such work papers , sharply criticized plans : “ The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant children and small children , ” declared Matthias Wolfmidt von Foodwatch .
According to Wolfmidt , the nervous poisoned threshold for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai or Gradual fish , is to be raised from one million grams of mercury each kilograms of fish .
Large pockets , however , are already so much burdened with mercury that about 50 % of the farms can not be sold on the basis of the existing threshold .
After doubling the threshold , only 14.5 % would be unridiculous .
In exchange for this easing , according to Foodwatch , the EU wants to tighten the threshold from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram .
But Foodwatch referred to this as a " trick , " because smaller crops , such as carpets , are usually so low that they are already meeting planned peaks .
So lowering small fish was " a perfidious distraction merely helping the economy " explained Wolfmidt .
Quecksilver is a highly toxic human heavy metal that is greatly enriched through the food chain , especially in robbery fish .
The German government therefore warns that " small quantities , especially in unborn damage to the nervous system , " can cause damage .
The State Department says that its homage in terms of its current peaks is that " health threats to the general population " can not be expected to be .
Quecksilver comes mainly to the environment through coal burning .
Germany ’ s coal-fired power plants , according to the State Department ’ s written release , amount to Annalena Baerbock , a member of the Green Bundestag , spend more than six tons of mercury a year , two-thirds of the total in Germany .
The concentration of mercury in fish , for example , in Elbe , Rhein , and Donau was " permanently and capriciously superior " had quoted the " mirror " from paper in March .
Last year , Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU ’ s warning system , RASFF .

Returning to the very American ideal of labor rights as Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to establish the organization of trade unions as civil law.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs die," Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
As a result, I am proud to join the civil rights group John Lewis in introducing the Workers ’ Law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunity to discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as it does in other forms of discrimination – and thus discourages anti-union forces.
The amendment of the National Labor Law to create a way for discriminatory workers to organize a union agency in order to prosecute justice in a civilian court – and to obtain damages or punishments – is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the further sponsors suggest in their proposed legislation is to link it back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and others around the country – Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and retain labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when they called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom, and unification in a respite.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged Japan to pass a constitution aimed at ensuring that Hedki Toyos ’ s militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Aware that workers and their unions were gaining a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "workers' rights are guaranteed for unification and common bargaining and action."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism replaced Adolf Hitler with strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would have to organize and voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly telling them: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed for individuals and every profession or commercial.
Agreements aimed at restricting this right or at reducing it are zero and nice; policies aimed at it are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted as adopted as a global agreement in 1948 by the United Nations, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to govern its interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country told other countries how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then be protected in collective negotiations as an equal partner with business and government agencies.
Indeed, with those rights in America under attack, it is very wise to reconsider the American ideal, according to which working people must have the right to unite and gain a voice in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement has increased, not narrowed, the strength of the nation.
By raising the living standards of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History is reminiscent, and we should.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and extension of protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' rights - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past, triggering the promise of democracy.
Judges temporarily halt legislation that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force them to close down.
A US federal judge for the moment on Sunday suspended implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, enacted by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, was enacted in June and scheduled to enter law on September 1, would force doctors who carried out abortions to acquire their practice at a hospital of 30 miles.
But the judge ’ s decision means that, for the time being, doctors can continue to legislate abortions while requesting such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in law while striving for their gains," German judge John Gradevelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing is being set for the judge to make the law a more durable decision.
Supporters of abortion welcomed the decision, which in a series of recent judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors gained more time to establish hospital control.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana will escape from a dubious law that would deprive them of their health and rights," Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who had tried in the name of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and sought instructions.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that has enacted similar legislation, with courts recently unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi claiming such measures.
Key offices of a Texas law that would have forced most remaining clinics to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocates of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that qualification rights require unnecessary restrictions by doctors.
Supporters of abortion counter that the measures would protect women ’ s health, even though some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has a patient ’ s generic right to reproductive rights.
The group said that if all other state doctors were forced to stop issuing abortions, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would no longer perform the operation.
In arguing against the verdict, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish doctors for conducting abortions, while their applications would still be pending for patient entry.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, have put a video mage online for her mother, who died from ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in Australia ’ s rural areas, there is a greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1100 Australians, who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25% were still alive after diagnosis.
The QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute ’ s research director Susan Jordan has said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20% higher in the study than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE – New drugs could slow down learning and ovarian cancer.
The researchers examined women ’ s medical care for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman ’ s age in diagnosis, ovarian cancer, existing primary health, and social and economic status also influenced survival opportunities.
For older women, and those whose cancer had advanced at diagnosis, survival rates were the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20% higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study failed to investigate why women outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects that the diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers is the potential factors.
"This disease is best treated by lynac oncologists, and these are mostly in major cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter distance, as a possible remedy, she proposed reinforcing the service of captured doctors to allow specialists to deliver women more densely to their homes, and providing treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study yielded a poor long-term survival of egg cancer for women, underscoring the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
Today, the study funded by Rio Tto de to Conquer Cancer is published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned of the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Guarantee Calls Recall to Lower House Sanctions
The decline, together with a higher fall in the number of homeowners under 35, could cause clothing centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, are reported in The Financial Times to achieve the "nuclear age group for peer products."
The report says that, on average, Mieter spends 55% of the amount that people spend on their homes.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardening gardens, aspiring to popular procedures, subterfuges to parks, and declining gardential size are other factors that threaten the industry, which enforce an estimated £5 billion annually.
In large London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditures on garden products per household are reported.
The HTA and Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not move plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Guard Adviser for the RHS, said, "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with rent people because they can take their crops in a move."
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the "golden age" of the garrison trade, owing to rising homeownership levels and economic prosperity from the late 1980's to the mid-1990's.
He also predicted this year that market conditions would improve, owing to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
Pakistan ’ s protest movement, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, some 1,000 protesters have stormed PTV ’ s state-owned television station.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station hired its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sinking again.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to reach Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence.
Roughly a kilometer away from this, they fought collisions with security forces and stones.
The police used tear-gas tears.
The protesters demanded Sharif ’ s resignation, but he rejects it.
Meanwhile, the country's army admonishes into a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using violence."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday, the military said: "The army remains obliged to maintain the state's security."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan, and has already been more frequent in coups.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accused Prime Minister Sharif of cheating last May ’ s parliamentary election.
The protests escalated on weekend, after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to enter Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey Says Upon US Diplomat for Spionaire Law
Turkey ’ s foreign ministry has issued its oldest US diplomat to announce a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the counterpart of the US Embassy and Turkish officials addressed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden shows that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the report ’ s importance, saying that all the major countries spying on each other.
A previous report that Germany ’ s most important intelligence service, Ankara, also targeted a far more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
The Warnings of Local Leaders with Effects for Pendler
The local leader ’ s warnings on the Montday could also affect the movement of people to NRW.
The IDF, announced for 18 to 21 p.m., includes all traffic companies, including farm, regional, and S-Bahn traffic.
The main focus of the warnings is the movement of goods.
Football: A. Burgi/Archiv
The director of the German Locomotive Association (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant defaults.
Regional focus is not enough.
The main focus of the warnings is movement of goods.
The German pathway at NRW announced that it would do whatever it takes to minimize the impact.
But the GDL has not said where it wishes to strike, so it is hard to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
The Police Chief of Maaluf charges corruption
The prosecutors provided evidence on Mallorca ’ s office on Friday of the State Prosecutor ’ s Office for Police blackmail and staff from the city of Calvià.
Calvià ’ s police chief at Mallorca ’ s holiday hotspot was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and barrators in the infamous Binge-Drinking Hotsaluf.
The main commissioner, José Antonio Navarro, was detained in custody after corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors submitted evidence on Friday of police blackmail by Calvià, the prosecutor ’ s office for the anti-corruption lawyer.
Two other local policemen were arrested by Spain ’ s Guardia Civil, in conjunction with corruption charges, and are consulted by a judge with Navarro.
The ABC, the national Spanish newspaper, reported that the disgruntled retailers canceled that the authorities ’ cronyism had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let ’ s leave our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer, owing to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a rist.
Ever since, the island authorities have tried to stop alcoholic holidays in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic crushes.
The Playhouse Club, which hosted the Fellatio incident, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipours organizer Carnage collectively must pay a fine of €5,000 ($73,000).
The tourist sport of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British hosts, is also well known for many instances under alcohol injury, including the trend of "balancing," in which people spend from one balkon to another, or from one balcon into the hotel pool.
The first spring night of hate and storm weather conditions impairs flights from Adelaide Airport.
The FRUHLING has provided a window of surprise to southern Australia, with heavy stores and heavy winds affecting flights from Adelaide airport.
On the evening to 21, more than five kilometers of rainfall fell into the city, down from 6.6 meters already on Sunday.
The latest raid was the result of a series of short, stormy spectators, including a launch that began just 20 days ago and caused almost 4 meters of rainfall.
After last week ’ s winter produced an early dose of spring, the city ’ s temperatures fell again to a peak of just 15.8 ° C on Monday.
Good weather conditions probably led to the belated landing of Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30, but was hit by a glimmer - a sudden change in wind velocity or directed at a short distance - and had to be launched.
Winds reached about 50 kilometers/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The airline data showed that the plane had to go through a second landing, and eventually stopped around 20,40.
The airline delay subsequently led to the belated of some other flights, including an Emirats flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a high temperature of 16 ° C on Tuesday is predicted, with possible actors.
Matthies says: Stop Time for Big Bang
Faced with galloping technological advances that threaten to turn our home into high-tech hubs, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles with an extremely familiar electronic audience.
As I write here, my view falls on the spiraling linking the village to the phone, and I think Boah, how retro is?
But there is a reasoning behind this: if the cable weren ’ t, in short order all the words would be wounded with no harm in the house, and that would be significantly more saving.
After all, is the case for Yeltsin (eccentric)?
No, a doppage: electronic) sector is buying - out - the rule that today's new world is the electronic default of tomorrow.
And anyone who still has a village television, for example, who says that he is fundamentally opposed to television.
Why these considerations?
Because urging the ifa at its length this week reminds us of our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The layman, who once ruled washing machine and CD players blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are used to be broadcast with immeasurably offensive expert spokespersons: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care, and Urban Technology" promises the press office.
Yes, is it still going?
What is to be said of those who appear to be opening such a quartz contest?
After all, it has been for about 20 years, above all, that we have been happy to get our house connected most.
By doing so, the Joghurt will emulate himself to tell us that the arson in the holiday is burning in the workroom.
And would it not be surprising if we were to move from the Office on the Climate Addition to our Sourly Future...
Yes, however, this presupposes a climate-change plant.
But one dream certainly becomes true: we are lifting our watch of poverty, says you "soil!" - and at home the soak bottle feeds on.
Irre.
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown commodities are awash," an industry rogue, one can link the washing machine with a headscarf, the steam garden sends the weather reports, and the datbrille shows how long the pizza in the bag still needs, but that is useful because we are in the spotlight.
We also know from daily practice: if a refashionable device is badly needed, the battery is guaranteed.
What another reason is that the telephone spiraling will survive the next workout.
Israeli children return to their schools after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza returned to school on Monday after spent time in airspace in the summer, while rockets and killers were shut down by their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained shut down while the area recovered from fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities registered by rocket incursions in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remain fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff from the "pashosh" infant garden who was met by a rocket met before the students arrived at grandchildren's walls and snakes.
"We have a little fear, but we are upset," said Ronit Bart, a Kibutz inhabitant in Saad, and a English teacher there.
Many children from our area desperately need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that it feels "a little comic" to return to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week, thousands of border residents like Saad left their homes in their homes, or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and village fire.
Many inhabitants of Middle Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grant, are reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not returned.
Their children were taught in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a frontier city with Gaza that was heavily characterized by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and provide you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an open-ended ceasefire.
Arms calm brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, like Hamas ’ s demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and maritime Gaza ’ s rivers.
Israel calls for Hamas to disarm and transfer the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were killed by Palestinians and the UN estimates.
Israel denies this, and estimates that at least half of the gods are combatants, but did not provide any concrete evidence of that information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and assassinations during the fighting against Israeli cities, most in the south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israel ’ s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools rebuilt in premature safe havens.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and continue to fight, the education authorities postponed the beginning of last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can learn further, as the world's children and Jewish children do," says Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza.
After the election in Saxony: CU Vice of Power bl challenges NPD supply-side procedures.
Faced with the NPD ’ s loss of its vote in Saxony, CDU vize Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin – According to the CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be put to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than it did last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU chief in Baden-Württemberg, the "governor's newspaper."
This is a good development in the right direction, and it is more likely to lead me to get the results of the NPD being fought politically, not in the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed in Sunday ’ s election campaign.
A first motion to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at the time had also led the NPD.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council filed a new application in Karlsruhe.
The German government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
On the newest floor, refugees are now put in tents.
The central seizure of refugees in Harburg is flying out of thin air.
Now the Interior Authority has hijacked three tents of the Red Cross.
Urban politicians were soon informed - they are unenthusiastic.
"These skin rocks continue to inflame citizen reservations, giving local politicians no way to engage constructively in the human shelter of refugees," says Britta Messmann, the leader of the Green Women in the Harburg District Assembly.
Harburg, its party demands that the District Administration currently provide unused houses for housing.
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents.
The reasons for overfulfillment are the rush to assist – and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough places to torture facilities.
So many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
The home prices have seen the strongest winter increases in seven years, a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for housing in Australia ’ s capital rose 1.1% in August, according to Monday ’ s RP data.
That is because the total increase is 4.2% in June, July, and August, the biggest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9%, more than twice the rise in the 12 months ending in August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne would press for a two-tier market.
RP data show that home prices rose 16.1% last year in Sydney, whereas in Melbourne by 11.7%.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose by five and 6% on average.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by just 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless continued to say that, with the beginning of the spring, a rise in real estate in the coming months would now be seen to be followed by the market for "a real test."
"If one looks at the persistence of high rates of asset prices, a generally rapid sales rate, and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that housing prices will rise even further over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the CEO Peer Medau ’ s testimony and attacked him as being “like a field man. ”
This is not the style of higher education, it is said.
For example, the Medau family had already been "informed carefully in mid-June about the claims of higher education.
The statement that the plans became known only July is definitely wrong, "according to worshippers.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-interpretations, let alone" decisions, but there are "preferences."
Likewise, the development required for the journey to the finish end is not so dramatic as the medals feared.
Of a nine meters of street, the speech was and is not.
There are 5.50 meters on current levels, which is a meter broader than so far, "says idols.
The argument made by machine-operators that their cost-free and guilty parks will be used only by students in higher education in the future does not want to be worshipped.
Not at all, this is not possible because, like other public parks, it is now intelligently resolved.
Think of the Citizens
The Child Crippy Bergwichtel, located on deposits and on their doorstep, would lead to parking down, according to the premier of higher education, "will not be affected."
Instead, he acknowledges that "this is not just a child copper, but also a resident ’ s inclusion at the Friedrich-Staff Road and 800 students in neighboring real education.
So there is much more to the issue than the special interests of the ruler Medau, according to worshippers.
Whether criticism of the parents' Council of Child Crimea is that, with the development of the street, one of the few natural-resourced smugglers Coburg is "justified," the reader himself can decide. "
In early October, worshippers, together with the State Bureau of Bamberg, want to inform urban councils about the construction of higher education by 2020, ” and address the importance of the new development. "
Peer Medau ’ s parents had informed the school ’ s plans last week of the Child Crimea River.
So the new parking journey is to guide not the campus and the Friedrich River Road, but the Medau-Berg.
This would require a two-way street building on about one kilometer longer.
According to the medals, traffic in the park of Snow Hohenfels would increase ten-fold.
Speaker of about 2,000 cars is every day.
From the town, they have not wanted to speak so far.
Gland Says Back from Cell National Cup
Holger Gland will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of SG Flensburg-Handewitt, a federal religious leader, raised health problems for deciding this choice.
I have not fallen easily; it has been mature for several months.
It is time to listen to signals from my body and end my career in the national team, ” the World Cup of 2007 told me on my Facebook page.
He thus has a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany in the international retirement system.
Because the huge retractor of the Flensburg champion League-winning camp wants to go to Torejagd for several years, he is no longer available to Dagur Sigursson, a new federal criminal.
The Iceland, known as its cadre for the Swiss country games on the Tuesday, introduced Glandorf a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enamored me as much as they will enthusiasm my long-time co-players and my successors.
But for my club, I also want to be healthy in the years ahead, which requires longer regenerational spillovers that do not permit the current duplication.
The left-wing countries even had to fear their career after a manufacturing infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles ’ s problems, he had been treated with a Cortisong injection by teamdoctors at the German Handball Tribunal (DHB), who had later provoked strong inflammatory.
An emergency operation and two more interventions followed.
Then Gland had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, and the controversy ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of profession and 11 years of national team careers are not missed in any body.
I have some health buildings that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related footsteps that took place in 2012, I have never properly conquered my blood pressure.
To do so is to obtain some other veiled complaints.
As early as the year, I noticed that while I control my head, I can not deceive my body, "Gland in the interview told the magazine" Handball Time. "
He would stand ready for a comeback only in absolute emergency.
"When all bandwalls hit, I am always willing to talk," the two-time father told the journal.
But I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play mobile football.
I also need to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humiliating about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to walk, at least in a somewhat fashionable fashion.
In addition to the WM-title 2007 and the profits of the Champions ’ League in 2014, he delivered the EHF Pokal in 2008 and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the Pocalwinner ’ s Council of Europe with Flensburg.
Germany ’ s Economy Slashed 0.2% in the spring.
The crises around the globe have put a brake on the German economy in the second quarter.
GDP fell by 0.2% relative to the headquarters from April to June 2014.
This divided the Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual record, the first half of this year recorded a combined GDP plus of 0.8% relative to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point, and the target of the "Münsterland Mooists" that led for the first time on Sunday by the Burgman City.
The Burgman town Horstmar was witnessed on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "fishing drivers."
The Netherlands's largest railroad transport association, NTFU, embarked on the so-called "papacy engine."
In this, the biggest railway is through Munister country, railway paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants would need their registration with Jos Huerne for organizing the roundride through the Munister country.
In various journals, this tour interest was offered.
We come from heroes and are driven overnight to participate in this roundride.
We want to learn the Munister country in this way, too, "the cyclists were happy to learn this way about the traffic through the Steinfurt, Borks, and Coesfeld Route.
Following the declaration in the Sta River ’ s Colonel of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Katharina went on a small "peace drive" through the city over the Wall, where it also came from.
Further, the road map, written for three distinct categories, to the heart of the howl floor of Berg to Coesfeld and to Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On districts of 95 kilometers with 175 high meters, 120 kilometers (1475 miles) of 1475 high meters, and 145 kilometers (175 miles) of 1775 cattle, the cyclists demonstrated their good contact.
They were burned into Havixbeck and imagery.
The chief organizer of Jos d ’ t Huerne and mayor Heinz Loil-fing ’ s mayor, has shown great pleasure in doing so.
We are happy, and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems, and there were no negative incidents, "draws Heinz Loil-fing a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the age had hoped, probably owing to poor weather forecasts and tomorrow ’ s rain.
"We are seeing another beautiful weather swimming back into 2015 on August 30 or a weekend," but the cyclists still promised to return to the Munich Country and the Ancists are planning a new edifice.
Constantin Wecker ’ s brazenly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical credentials than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, Living Macher, Pazifist, police activist, ex-detainee, into "monks and warriors," to 287 pages.
The Munich born on June 1, 1947, wrote his memoirs, every chapter ushered in by a suitable Liedtext, rather than chronic.
And he is relentlessly honest: from the online gymnasiest to laser fuel and drug use, he does not leave human weakness.
To show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings, too.
There are also abstract but even more important terms: love, soul, ego, and his in the Now, spirituality - all of which he seeks to go on the ground - in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, social criticism, political commitment – and, indeed, the pattern not only of music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison.
The latter has also brought the Lebeman Konstantin Wecker closer to the asketic monk who generates "through subtraction," he says, "by letting out everything unnecessary."
There are also brief anecdotes between all the high-minded views on earth: brief stores of beatings in a lokal known by GIs, or a ludicrous motoring head-on visiting a tree.
There, too, he is relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry – My father never took me into his arms.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midland in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was, worked in a factory, and her relationship was limited.
Henry promotes a Rudy's Rare Records commission, based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and based on the series on radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with vivid melodia.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw your face, only listened: "Stop crashing.
Do your sister in quiet.
Moving You!
I want to see cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton – who had grown up when I was a child – went to the buck with him and talked about things like the mode of Bierglases or the beauty of a cricket.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
For much of my life, he was this serious type of corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a gunshot in Dudley, and while conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won a glimpse of how life might have been for him.
It is a bit brighter now, but it is dark, smoking, deep stygical labyrinthe with flame meals and smoke, and much black.
My father used to step into the orbit, and then you could begin to hear him sink because he could wash the vascular.
When I lay there, I realized that he had done so for years to put food on the table, and that my respect for him became greater.
Yet Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love creations.
My father never embraced me; he never said, "I love you."
Only when my mother was doing badly at the end of her life did we start "I love you, I love you to say, I love you."
His own daughter, Dawn French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you"?
Too poor!
Papa, I am 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still comfortable with French people who married 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn ’ t we be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henr ’ s own mother was Diabetics.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became much, very important, and symptoms of diabetes became clear, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I withdrew this fitness and had to turn a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is tough.
No one likes to eat carotene.
Henr ’ s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since praised by critics of his othello, he has been captured by theater.
The comedy followed the error, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is different from the comfort and comedy that its business life has filled.
He began at just 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DRY discovered it on the scene when he imitated and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970's. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to get big not only to the public ’ s eyes, but also to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient witze-fits-all machine, while television I was a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny at New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the right to fire at Black and White Minstrel Show, a minor entertainment program in which people "became black," Henry comedy ran up over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wished that it would never have happened, but I do not regret that I had.
It was a peculiar, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of inexpensive British television" was also a "grotesque parodes of black people."
By introducing characters that both derided and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 1980 ’ s on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to the show in 1984, and he was known in the Neuncians, among other things than the kitchen chief, Gareth Blacklock, in the Comedyserie!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film roles coined his next decade, but, after his 2008 BCSerie LennyHeny.tv, he thought that, "What you do next, Len feels so next, because it gives you only time, or trip a little little little on the ground."
After that, was a Radio 4 documentary called What\ u0027s So Great About...
The first consequence was Shakespeare ’ s turn.
On Shakespeare, I have been spectacularly allergic.
I had never really learned anything about him in school, and mostly held him over for a middle-class domain, whites in Strumphosen, and a cohort.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trebefore Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "Thought to try it.
Don ’ t be bad if you don ’ t know what you are saying.
Nimm some of the words, and then you understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry ran 20 lines of Othellos ’ s last speech on the documentary film, and he was enthusiastic.
I felt that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally turned my head right.
"It's a serious thing, noble to say, to your texts, to investigate you a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read that piece months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and this simply did not happen.
Soon he stepped up in the comedy of error.
Suddenly, I was in the national theater, and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought "Oh, you've changed you haste."
There was a technical mistake, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to keep the audience.
"A small voice now told me" You must bridge 10 minutes while repairing the computer. "
Instead, the friend announced that once the problem was resolved, the idea would continue.
I went on the scene, and something I said in "Oh was thank God."
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave that someone else.
"You play in a piece of theater, so stay in your role."
Henry on Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the craving.
This, too, did well, so it is like a big sign of gods telling me that "That's your destiny here."
He says this, of course, with a dONNERNDA.
So I stick to it.
I really love this.
I love being in a room for sample.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is riddled with humorous outbreaks while imitating people.
I have decided not to make a standup comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
When you search for it, you will be fed by a wall.
I sometimes live in Apollo when I am lucky to do so, but there are not as much to me as I did in the past.
I ask him whether he will ever make a standard comedytour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a start, a median, and the end of a journey - I don't think I want to give up ever again.
Is this his new incarnation here?
I already think so.
I like to be an actor.
It ’ s fun.
One always tells a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels blocked roads in Yemen ’ s capital.
In the conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and Yemen ’ s government, the Houthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Huthi-followers would have occupied key streets in Sanaa on Monday, said an Speaker of the Houthi Party, Ansar Allah.
Driving to parliament, too, was blocked.
Jemeni media report a highway in the capital.
According to the newspaper "Yemen Post," Huthik leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday.
Huthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict, according to the newspaper, if his demands were not fulfilled.
The Shia Houthis is fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding that the government resign.
Houthi ’ s popular origin has been besieging the Yemeni capital for nearly two weeks.
Roughly 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on Sanaa ’ s big trajectory.
Conversely, bloody struggles with the Yemeni army continue.
Kenya is registering civil servants to curb "ghost workers."
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to wipe out "ghost workers" from the government's pay lists.
Workers who would stop registering over the next two weeks would no longer pay for themselves were a government department.
The government suspects that thousands of people will be paid salaries even after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight public corruption when he took office in 2013.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts after a person died or public services have left, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identity centers in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registration are included in a government education.
Everyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be slashed by the payroll list would still be a division.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the civil service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and cleaning up pay lists at both levels of government -" the "ghost workers" said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.
The art adviser Helge Achenbach scandal will be negotiated for the first time in court on November 11.
Five heirs to Berthold Albrecht, the son of the founder of Theo Albrecht, are calling for a civilian trial in the village ’ s village court of 19.4 million euros of breach and two of its companies in bankruptcy procedures.
This included a lawyer on Monday.
In the slaughter, Achenbach is said to have cheated in purchasing art plants and oceans, and Berthold Albrecht calculates higher than what actually paid.
This also raised the agreed vision.
Eighteen bach has bought €121 million in value for old breeds.
Children Need Roots and Rivers
He served 44 years in school, 23 of which he was in school.
From that time, Manfred Judges know many established peer officers and customs brokers of their time as students.
His methods have sometimes been unconventional, but always driven by his desire to see people in students.
The snowfall is the best-known mountain of the giant mountain.
Manfred Judges loves the painting with the motive out of his homeland.
Judges were born in Trautenau/Northern Lights in 1930, now Trutnov.
He was already interested in teaching after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within a half-hour, the family had to leave.
After a few months in one camp, Bayans went to Bavagon in 1946.
So it sucked judges to the upper house of Senkendorf.
Teachers ’ education was at Bamberg.
To do so, Manfred Judges had to go for six kilometers per week to the next railway to Bamberg, travel to Bamberg, go to school three kilometers across the city, and go back steadily.
After two months, Manfred Judges in a Red Cross home in Bamberg got a scramble: with as many as 15 fellow traders in a bedroom.
In 1951, he made the first, and in 1954, after three years of Lehman ’ s nominees the second term.
Since Supreme francs had no free textbook for him, he went to Colonel Bavarians and went to Collbach on November 1, 1954.
The "funeral room" was his first "servant apartment" in school houses.
In 1958, he rebuilt teachers ’ homes beside school.
That house bought Manfred Judges in 1980, after the 1968 school had been dissolved.
Until then, there were three classes in the school association, Petershouse and Customs, and five in peer shops.
From the 1968/69 schooling year, they were summarized in peer shops in today ’ s Rathaus.
When the school association in Inderdorf was established, only the primary school remained in the place.
To avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, Georg Sigl, then a rector, changed to Karlsfeld and Manfred Judge.
But peer shops grew, enabling children and their teachers to acquire, by September 1982, the current construction that was expanded after Judge ’ s retirement in 1997.
Manfred Judges praises the intricate generosity of then-Mayor Ludwig Götz, who was also building squitoes on municipal costs and enlargement in 1997, even though it was not accessible according to school building guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very guilty," Judges remembered.
Throughout his career, Manfred Judge never forgotten the speeches by a government official who responded to a referral of a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Judges surrendered what he had heard as a young teacher.
"One must tell children two things: roots and wings," says today's 84-year-old.
And he has learned that "this does not always happen." Whether he means only his students, or his own six children just as well, is not entirely clear.
In any case, judges ’ actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students tested, they did not receive, say, a criminal record, nor were they being denied offshore.
At the expense of the community, judges had created two pairs of box-trade, leaving the two opponents to swing against each other even if there should be a veto.
For the sake of the school ’ s sake, judges had a good relationship with then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He traveled the partisan judge after his retirement bid to run for municipal CSU last year, at least in 1996.
But judges were nominated for six, and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in Three Days
HR4-RADTOUR ’ s 700 bicycle drivers are in the short term of Bad Salzhausen and Scots in the interim stop.
Nothing special is in itself when Radler, on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, makes races.
On Friday, however, only the number of castes appeared: the 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour and the attendant enjoyed a pause in the lower Kurk of Bad Salzhausen, and then a party free of heaven in the Scots ’ s Alteburg park.
Under the slotto "Radles and celebrates on newfound pathways between Nidda and Child Day," participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert of Van Baker & Band Band.
This Friday, it became serious: the cyclists took the first steps to address more than 60 kilometers of flortown to Bad Salzhausen and still to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was helped with bicycle in Bad Vilbel in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the self-directed Bad Salzhausen, Petra Sweden,.
To breathing body and mind, all had been prepared for good things: the rural women of Rantown and Dutch Mockstadt had born 85 bleche of apples, coercive, Stream, and kitchens, who miraculously silenced the decent raids.
"Such pieces can only blow up rural women," one participant praised Aulebach, while he ordered another.
At the destitute of the tournament naura, cold frictions could be restored.
The "Duo Bravo" kept visitors with well-known melodies from opera chains and music cals and received enthusiastic applause.
The Parks ’ beautiful ambition was distracting.
One man also enjoyed a headscarf from his partner: "He deserved, after all, to rebuild rock bicycle chains today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the CEO had to work: they were interviewed at the wells before the drinking house by reporter Rainer Janker, and seized the opportunity to operate in the radio for Bad Salzhs.
Likewise, since the first hr4-Radtour to lead Tobias Hagen in 2004, Promotion chief could swim only briefly, he has had ample local engineering to do with.
His Pickup-Truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the police ’ 15-year-old motorcycle coffle, wrote Facebook shops, and filed reporting, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhein-Main area," he told, "but also from shale or fulda, from the wildbach, the tunus, and even from numerous cities in Western fals.
The number of participants is a bit built up for the overnight capacity at hand.
In category I, the participants in Hotels are taught, in category II in collectivity subscribers.
From the short floor, the cyclists had a good impression when they reappeared after a year and a half: "Chad!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" They wasted to leave.
After the arrival of Scots, the group was allowed to recur briefly.
But on the evening, the Idyllic Alteburgpark ’ s radars were called for.
Under the regime of Scottish society for tourism and urban marketing (GTS), the Park had received a beautiful fortune ambition, and, of course, leakers, such as pigs with well-coolly white pieces, were prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoschfeld, and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs were greeted by the visitors in his role as CEO of ADAC Hessen-Things.
The three showed alacrity at the "many factories in Scots."
DJ Tobias ’ s hair then released the tanks.
The opportunity for a splendid ride under free heaven, despite sporting on the bicycle.
Among the guests, an increasing number of citizens, who were as well off as the raters, were slipping under the guests.
The second day, the cyclists saw Birstein, Watherbach, and Bad Orb - including a constellation with separation forest - on the agenda.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of radar, athletes hit Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish policemen are arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the suspect of the "conspiracy" against the government, reported by local media agencies.
The police authorities did not issue an immediate comment.
Among the detainees, 14 senior police officers, according to Hürriyet Daily News.
Some were involved in the corruption investigations of government employees, including four government ministers last December.
A number of Turkish policemen were arrested in July for allegedly establishing an organized criminal organization and capturing telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Gülen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine Return to School
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after summer vacations.
That day has traditionally been an important day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk has taken his daughter to school.
He told cautionary journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not all over Ukraine.
We must fight for peaceful heaven.
All of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people ’ s front, must fight for a peaceful skies.
Aleksan Pastukhow, the school chief in Slawjansk who attends Jazenjuk ’ s daughter, spoke of Russian.
We hope that peace is at last restored, and that children will receive an education that will benefit them further in life.
The first schooling day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing designated shirts, keeping balloons in the hands of Ballon, and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
It arrives with a proud crackdown from the banking world, media management, and the Tory Party ’ s inner circle.
And it has its own frontier experience.
Their career began at the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearson.
It was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years, and resigned when the parent company ’ s top job went to a younger male colleague.
The revelation was supposedly close to £1 million.
Their political ranking, too, is sound.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of the BP, when he sought more private knowledge in whitall: she became the adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is an early story of Council membership.
In May, I described the job of chair with a poisoned kitch.
Not only is the BBC at the heart of public life a huge and complex entity, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence acts in two directions: inward the first guard of the BBC ’ s managerial ethic, but also outward as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that demands full reform.
But how newly arrived chair would risk doing everything, beating on everything, and grasping an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps pulling itself around his job.
It is a difficult task.
And, as if that were not enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power, money, and status outstripped.
As competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC carries special dangers.
To the modest sum of £145.50 per year, the British public certainly buys into the world ’ s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96% of all households, costing just 40 pence per day.
And the BBC seems to be rising again upward on the popularity scale: 53% today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The BBC ’ s marine and utility habits have changed: I see news headlines nowadays on my cell phone and see missed programs later on my imitator.
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution.
She needs a respectable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry of Texas says that disabling tweet was not authorized.
On Sunday, a tweet from the official contingent account of Texas ’ s Republican Governor Rick Perry contained a chilling comment about the Democratic District Prosecutor, who stands at the center of a criminal indictment against him for abuses of power.
The tweet was later wiped out and replaced by another Perr ’ s account, which took the previous step away.
Just a tweet was sent from my account that I had not authorized.
"I didn't endorse the tweet, and deleted it," said the later news.
Perry ’ s staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perr ’ s official user account were excluded, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the former tweet, a favorable picture of Travis County ’ s district prosecutor, Rosemary Lehmberg, was recorded in April 2013 on the tax for drunk.
Perry vetoed funding for her office when she refused to resign, leading to a prosecution of Perry, who might be perhaps in 2016 presidential candidate, before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet is, "I don't always run dry alcohol... but if I like it, I sue Governor Perry when he breaks it down."
I am Texas ’ s most drunk democratic.
Lehmberg ’ s office did not command the Grand Jury against Perry investigations.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry goes unpunished and named the charges a political trick.
His high-class team of jurisdictions requested that the prosecution be dismissed, arguing that the law under which the earliest governor is administered in Texas ’ s history is incomprehensible.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the state -- based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas -- when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto produced public complaints by a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perr's official user account is often updated - and sometimes refrigerated.
After completing fifth at the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry relied on speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of photographs of a photograph near a lake, in the words "South Carolina, We come!"
Berkeley once again calls the housing market "normal."
One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England had returned to normal levels.
Households in the capital were hot and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage lending in June, owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial years, the market has returned to normal levels of transaction since its 2013 peak," and has added that it provides a "stable handle environment."
The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers rushed into the capital.
According to the Cell Office, prices in the city ’ s area alone jumped by 18.5% last year, well above the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales price of berkeleys for personal, low-cost, and student offers increased by about one-fifth last year, and stood at £423,000 by the end of April.
But a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of which have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric surrounding a possible "Villes Tax" before the general election this May.
London ’ s real-estate broker, Foxton, warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which presented sharper lending, would also lead to slower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a fall in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real-estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in house prices in London to 3% in 2015, on the basis of an already weakening skin standard.
Transaction volumes in the most expensive places in London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, have fallen by one-quarter year on year, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a boon, because the maturing amounts for future sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
As Mr. Pidgley added, "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable, and, as a result, futures sales have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes by the end of April – nearly one-third more than it had been before the crisis in 2007.
Annual tax rates rose by 40% per year, to £280 million, and sales by 18% to £1.6 billion.
In a department to the company ’ s annual meeting on Monday, Herr Pidgley said that this year ’ s Berkeley earnings were expected to correspond to current market expectations.
Analysts disagree with the £450 million annual pretax outcome.
Berkeley stocks stood at £23.96 on London ’ s afternoon.
Nacktfotos of Jennifer Lawrence by Internet Hackers
Jennifer Lawrence enters the 80th Oscarcian ceremony.
Nacktfotos of the Nobel laureate economist Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker claiming to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
One representative of the star, "The Tribute of Panem," confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were genuine and sued the hacker for "blatant injury to the private sphere."
The authorities have been noticed and will prosecute all those who continue to post Jennifer Lawrence ’ s stolen photographs.
The photographs originally postponed on the Foto-Sharing side, 4chan, were supposedly created by a gap in the online storage system iCloud of Apple. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Riha, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Wape, and Mary Kate Olsen, Buzzed Fezzed.
It is not certain how many of the images are real, though Wars "Star of" Scott Pilgrim condemned the rest of the world "to Twitter as well.
"To those of you who look at photographs that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you," Whilon Twitter wrote.
But Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeons "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were pictures of her game and tissue "these nakes of me are GEFELSCT, people.
Let ’ s not start at the same time. * Wortplay intends to be a screen.
Buzzfeed late Sunday reported that a spokesman of the pop Ariana Grande denied the cherishness of the alleged photographs.
Exclusive exit from Howard Jacobson's cherished new novel about love and letter "J."
It was the best way to describe it that it slowly disintegrated, like a carton in the cold.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, tough, intense, distanced, and perhaps blatantly citizens.
And then he shook his hands.
He knew the bright citizen.
He was stubborn, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this vengeance was a just beginning affair, promising to relieve his life ’ s lonely lonely boredom than usual, and perhaps even to him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was a tremendously fragile beauty, with countless hair and a flattening heart of a village on the coordinator even more remote and smothered than Port Refugee.
She had gone south with an older companion that held her aunt for her, and inherited a piece of land in a humid but paradisian valley with the apt name of Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The guns were empty; the trees were still in the stings; nakes had left their tracks on all the windows; and believed that they belonged to them all; and the garden was overrun with resentment that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house of a child ’ s garden, both threatening and alluring, a garden of secret.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel, "J," is on the London list for the man priced in 2014.
The shortlist is announced in the coming week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn ’ s corching on the broken songs of high grass and unusually warm spring night afternoon. Both had skillfully searched into the service console, which sent the country with reassuring music and scary news when the sight of its chastened brown brown babies had just sent him to a black container at a recent blackmail in a black rig.
My feet is too large.
Thanks to their own aggressiveness, Sugs of this kind were no longer played in consolation.
Not prohibited - nothing was so forbidden - simply not played.
Successful obsolescence has been made, as the word obsolete.
The public tastes created what gave rise and regulations never had achieved, and how people in books voted for Vom Teller Watch ’ s slaughter of millionaire memoirs, cochbooks, and love monkeys, they elected the Ballages in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary clave and to get big feet in a grob-comic Serenade of Ailinns.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"That was a well-known song of a jazz prince named Fat Wall," he told her, automatically shouting two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done so to stop the Bureau from coming out of his mouth.
It had started a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played it with his own father, he told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers above your lips, you will cost you a penny.
It wasn ’ t very humble at that time, nor was it very lucky now.
He knew that he was expected to be.
It had to explain what was jazz.
Ailinn had never heard about it.
Jazz, while not prohibited directly, was not played.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure about where they would end at the beginning of a melo.
The reason, too.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically assertive.
Though he had become 10 years old without being heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about his father ’ s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats was black.
She probably could not recall a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints were in place.
A constant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group design - thankful as that of destiny.
People with African-Caribbean origins were suited to entertainment and sports by temperament and body building, so they sang and burned.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent like nature, and were charged with ensuring that no family without a functioning service.
What was left of the Polish community was canalisation; what was left of Greeks shattered Teller.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WAS GESCHENHEN WAR, WENN GESCHEH WAR – fearful of being indicted for fires, fearing that the flames would feed them as the next – had been Labneh and Shisha-covered restaurants, given inexoration and depressive action.
Everyone after his skills.
Having heard only ballots, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that he had just proposed could ever be toned.
Music was an expression of love.
"These are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet is too large.
My father never insulated anyone, but he loved that move.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the shutdown of the huge coalescing floors.
Ailinn still didn ’ t understand.
Why should your father have love this way?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers back to the lips in her present.
She thought that he was something odd anyway.
"It seemed furious to him," he said instead.
They shaken their heads inexorably and forgotten Kesen ’ s view.
There was nothing else around the world than their rampant black hair.
Nothing else was there.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that is not what explains why you want me to do.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet Too Big?
He saw again.
Don ’ t hold your feet so directly.
Perhaps your clothes, a little little little little...
And, you say, do you hate me because my clothes are too fat?
hate you?
Of course, I haven ’ t hate you.
That is just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon for that.
"You're grabbing a big stick," he instead tried it, precisely because you like me.
I am a bit perverse.
This did not sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be comical, he was often in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the reassuring charm needed to contain the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he, mindful, wanted to be.
Despite his benign eyes.
Ailinn Solomon was red and dropped out of her love chair, switched the console, and buried the wine they had compromised.
Hubris flourished, so drunkness was no excuse for him.
In their excitement, she seemed too canny to be like Palmwedel ’ s storm.
"And your thinner head is precisely the reason why I feel so perverse to me that," she said.
Unless I am at all not at all.
She was sorry to him, both because of the unnecessary inconvenience of his words and the fear that she felt when she revolted against him.
Think that he would beat them?
She did not tell him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as this.
The same huge and sprawling oceans broke on the river.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more contaminated to DEM WAS GESCHENS WAR than their ancestors had been smugglers and mugglers, withdrew from taste to taste, always willing to rise hands against a woman who refused or lost.
Dick Copper?
That would have shown you a thick fist if they didn ’ t skip!
She was the most commonly used word for an erotic appeal between men and women, a counterpunch to the unsuspecting Console love ballots, and then beat them.
In Kesen ’ s view, this was unnecessary enemy, because the Kuchma himself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon ’ s body gave him a sign.
He became an old man in love.
She also felt stable, but the woes of his mourning surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They knew little about it.
She watched him become more remote, like a room on the upper floor, as he was watching, a man, complained by something he had invoked.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had leveled their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed down, shamed, beaten, beaten, and defeated without combat spirit - why was this a glimpse she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single time she had seen that day before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn Solomon looked on her feet again.
A few years before the recently reported incidents, Esme Nussbaum, a intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public-mood monitoring organ, a short lecture on continued violence at low - and middle-income levels, had been invested in precisely the areas of reducing, if not eliminating, the public mood that were most likely to be expected in terms of energy and investing in eradication.
"Much has already been done, and much needs to be done," she wrote, "to assuage the inherent aggressiveness of a people, to fight a thousand wars, and to most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where, historically, the South Age of human friendship has rarely been felt, despite the highly charged churches between the have-nots.
But some qualities turn out to be irreconcilable.
The higher the church tournament, it seems, the less the passion it continues to invigorate.
The population wears sentimental haves, robbed of stories of overweening difficulties, and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the former crucibility keep rural communities in hand, as well as our urban fabric, but there is evidence of the emergence of a new and fragile domestic contention, workplaces, and even plagues.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," says their mentor, when he read the entire report.
I propose you read fewer Romans.
Esme Nussbaum reduced her head.
I must also ask: are you atheist?
"I don't have to say that," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you read?
Again, Esme claimed their right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said eventually, "because I would oppose atheism, reading, or feminism.
This is a pre-judged job.
We serve a pre-judgment society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are inherently acceptable and commendable can occasionally distort outcomes that you have presented.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things you call "disguised" and "red" may as well be interpreted by others as reflecting a natural force and vitality.
If one continues to pick up, WAS GESCHEIST, WENN GESCHEIST, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking its essential vitality on the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED writer in Flamingorosa reiterated the advice Ofnow gave to the country over the last quarter-century or more.
When you smile your neighbor, value your partner, listen to Balladen, visit Musicals, use your phone, tell you, explain, agree, please, apologize you.
Speaks are better than silence, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to do," Esme Nussbaum answered with quiet voice when she was confident that her lawyer had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing more than that we are not yet as effective as we pretend to be.
My concern is that without warning, we may find out how we repeat the mistakes that led to DES GESCHEHENS, WENN GESCHEHIST, in the first place.
This time, however, it is not the others to whom we dispel our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz coined with his hands a pyramid.
In order to point to an essay dul.
"You go too far," he said, "when you call actions" a mistake that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They go too far, too far, when you talk that they have dismissed their "anger" and "suspicion" of "others.
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we are talking about "us" and "others."
There was no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder that is all we know.
"If we are honest about ourselves," to accept "daring eat," no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I don ’ t complain to anyone.
Whether or not it was done badly or well what happened happened.
That was then.
Nothing needs to be said - as we agree.
And just as no guilt must be assigned, so no guilt must be extinguished if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But what serves the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to forget them.
If I can say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz brought his pyramid together.
"I will remember their report," he said and dismissed it.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overrun by a motorcycle driver, who, as Passant described, had been driven, in a kind of "brutal anger" on the footpath.
There are accidents.
Lesothothou military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
Military officials in Lesotho denied that they had planned a coup to overthrow the government, saying that they were taking action against police accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and told that the country ’ s army had encircled its residence and occupied government building in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family into South Africa's adjacent neighborhood after reporting the threat of assassination.
Military spokesperson Major Ntele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military responded to the threat of "political fanatics" who armed the police.
"What happened tomorrow was that the staff of Lesotho Defense Forces operated after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements of the police actually wanted to arm some of the political and political young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc against Voice of America."
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela has said that military action has made the impression of a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have torpedoed the government by force, all accounts agree that the actions of Lesotho Defense Forces show signs of a coup so far," he said.
Speaker of Lesotho ’ s military spokesman told Sunday that soldiers would step back into their barracks, and that the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Mothetyoya Metsing, the deputy prime minister, takes over governance during Thabanes ’ absence.
Thabane said that he had become a target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June, after Thabane parliamentary sessions exchanged his unity government by fighting.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, but that he did not ignore vague accusations.
Manufacturing in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, a peculiarly observed study indicated.
The final market for purchasing managers ’ manufacturing (PMI) index fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
Insurance exceeds 50 admits expansion.
New orders have receded, and factories have seen declines in an era of rising EU-Russia tensions over Ukraine.
The numbers will hit the European Central Bank ’ s meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with the eurozone ’ s slow recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could issue more earlier this week about whether he contemplates quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those put forward by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than growth at all, the depressing effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, the senior economist at Markit.
The Fabrik PMI for Germany, Russia ’ s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months, at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy, the bloc, France, the PMI, fell to 46.9.
France remains a sorry type, as does Italy ’ s departure from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial groups in Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are no longer reassuring, either, said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry probably fuels the fire of analysts, who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing you can say for the eurozone ’ s purchasing managers index of August is that the sector continues to grow after that. ”
He added that "euro-zone producers now find life obviously quite difficult, as today's heightened geopolitical tensions -- particularly with respect to Russia and Ukraine -- increase uncertainties in many countries' continued difficult conditions.
These heightened uncertainties have clearly impeded the economy – especially, and consumer confidence – and probably lead some contracts to delay or even cancel, especially large contracts.
He said that "it would become increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to begin QE, "though we suspect that it will be limited."
Ten years ago have passed since the school ’ s terrible siege, as the children who have been immersed today have suffered.
A decade ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in an Beslan school in South Osseland.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death at the classroom in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, that seemed like the sister of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Their best hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now wracking - and in which children die like them - is ending.
The girl who was photographed in attempting to return to the shooting school athletes.
It was photographed and refrigerated by Russia ’ s startup, Dimitri Beliakov, only in her underwashing to return to the shooting school athletes after a mine exploded.
To be confused, Aida searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
"One woman told me that I should be running for my life, but I could not," Aida said at the time.
My legs were rampant.
I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother.
One soldier put her in safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, pain returned.
I fear that I need to be restored.
Some grandparents are still in my knees.
Their aim is to become a dentist to help people how their doctors helped them.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me apart," she says, "it is fighting.
"That happened to me, and it can not be changed.
Once a year, I am always in the sports hall to remember the one I have stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
Pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I start my studies and career.
A family I think of later.
She says that the siege will always be part of it, even though the memory becomes somewhat weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we get from people in the United Kingdom and everywhere.
When I see the online photograph of me dating back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe, and help that this will not happen again.
The boy who fled through the bullets believes that his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in his mother ’ s poor, Tamara.
When Seven years ago, he said, "Mama told me that I should go if there is an explosion and that I hold a hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "run run."
Flawed with fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way to a tiny young child, seized it hand, and fled through a bullets.
"Damir told me that his mother died.
"I could not save them," he said. "
In reality, Tamara was stumbled out and burned out with hospital injuries, in turn believing that her son had been killed.
After her reunification, she said, "I wear joy.
I could not believe it.
He was burning herself and impoverished by me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-uprooted newspaper News of the World) to receive a title from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie to Barnardo's Children's Campion.
"That horror haunts you every day, but I wished I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is in my memory.
I still know that, directly afterwards, I drove all my toy players away.
But now I can play computer games with guns, and that is no problem for me.
"I don't fear going back to the sports hall, but I don' t think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the court, and who failed to reach out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially to the mosquitoes where I could choose everything I wanted, and to drive in an open car above.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
That horror haunts you every day, but I wished I could stop reminding me of it.
"It is so sorry for me to do all those who suffer from Greeks" Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I like to help that way.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me to college next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine it?
I remember the terrible silence of the siege, there were simply no children to call and run silent, and that silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London hit when I told our history.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just say to her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir likes to eat Borschch and call for all Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant; Damir shot up with his water pistos and burned them away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horrors.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share and support our pain.
She said, "I always think that this world has not gotten better in those 10 years.
War is now going on in Ukraine, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and still killed.
These are just such children as our children.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else.
I simply know what these people feel, all the horrors.
And I can not stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir has become big and quiet young, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge; he is not overwhelmed by past Greeks.
I know that he does not like to recall it, but he has six close friends from the class, occasionally entering the sports hall and inciting candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes looked to the sofa, turned the face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he kept all of his weapons and other military toys wary; Damir is now 17, larger than me, well-intentioned, intelligent, and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead, and I would never see him again.
When I recovered and got on my feet after the explosion, I looked around and saw hell around me, sharing bodies surrounding everything.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not possibly survive in that hell.
"I remember calling him" Damir "Road Road," but I was so sure that he didn't listen to me.
But he listened and he went away.
So life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgia ’ s Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel Beslan.
Trouble: Georgia ’ s obsession survivor, Georgia ’ s Lyin, with his mother ’ s Fatima after the 2004 siege, is a right-wing image of Georgia today.
His bloodstained face was marked by fear when he was burning for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beslan ’ s barbarism.
His mother, Fatima, 54, had deposed him for his first day of school before she rushed to attend university for her older son, Vladimir.
"I left the court of about two minutes before terrorists stormed it, so my small boy stayed there for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not entirely, there was an entire family of relatives of us, but all were killed.
Only my Georgian managed to survive.
As that date approaches, it is harder to think and talk about it.
There is no single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don ’ t think it was long ago that I thought I had yesterday ’ s happened to follow some scenes from those days.
Nobody will ever forget that I promise you.
Put forcefully, the image of Georgian (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack, blurred as statue.
I remember that this day Georgian would like to go to school, saying that he wanted to bypass his teacher.
I knew he was alive only when I saw him on television.
And now there is even that statue of Georgia ’ s sinister San Marino.
Georgian does not like to see the picture, and we are stuck in a bookshelf at home.
I understand this, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgia today says, "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People repeatedly examine such tragedies, and never experience the truth.
And now they are examining the downing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused it?
This world will become something terrible.
"I can't understand how that is possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are not at all with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget little about it.
I have attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmare dreams for siege, but then it did better.
I returned to school later in 2004 and feared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates killed.
As a result, I will always be in the sports hall as September 1 approaches it.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I need to.
I do not feel like a victim; that story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I am not giving me.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and visited a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first election was to train the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgia ’ s Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived, though he was a lifelong terrorist.
One miracle: Georgii Faniyev was trapped by a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was on the foot of murderous terrorists.
It is really a wonder that he was not killed.
"We feel it would have been yesterday," says Georgij, who, as intelligence officer, wanted to go to the FSB, but could not do so because of his health damage from the siege.
It is still with me that it is not anything I have left behind.
I am older now, and people say that children are easily able to cope with bad experience - I have to say that they are wrong.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt somewhat better after psychologists, but I can not forget about it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in 2005 - was the first and only time since I returned to the sports hall.
I lost awareness.
I will never return to it again, and ask you not to show you where I have heard this famous picture.
Surviving: Georgian Faniyev Now, with a photograph of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop top of the league.
My pain is more egregious, and I meet it with me every day.
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
Physically, I am doing well.
I should be careful about my injured knee, but I can go well now.
But because of my health, I could not study the FSB ’ s secret service in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, including medical contractors, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the animal medical institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I knew I would never report to my children my experience.
Children should know nothing, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never emits me.
He is in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will remember the celebrations.
I know that Georgia will not go down.
He has to be much tougher for him, because he was and I was not there.
I waited and could not help at home.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, all of which are recorded in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgia is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept this when something so unfair affects you.
He is a boy, he likes to be a sport, but he can not participate because of his knees.
It has been operated several times, and it can run, but it can not spur it.
I would say he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never overcome it altogether and forget.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and that only reinforces my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who I knew well and were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart wine for the goats.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of jokes who never married again.
It is hard to accept that life will continue, even if you don ’ t want it.
I will never forget how my heart swept me when I saw it in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can ’ t believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can we be fighting now?
People and children suffer; I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many have been killed.
If only we could grasp and throw all of these rebels up, as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, so notable by a special operational squad, was secured in safety.
True, Aljona Tskajewa is taken safely (left) by a Russian special command.
It is ten (right), and it does not recall the cruelties at all.
The world kept its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried out in the poor of a Russian policeman from the Beslan siege.
Terrorists left them to go, but they held their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina, and their brother in school sports all.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona ’ s mother and sister died in murderous carnage.
Her father, Ruslan, has since been cured again, having a small girl with his new wife, Swetlana, calling him after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not recall the siege, and has grown into a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona, and they are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a phantom father, and wants to avoid all the memories that mark the tenth anniversary.
They will understand why.
man accused of having having transferred girls into fiefdoms on a football transition.
A 78-year-old man is on trial for transferring a girl of three years to a football transmission.
Gordon Steward is accused of having applied a girl to the transition to Pitte in East New New Year.
The indictment claims that Mr. Steward steward steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention, and that the girl injured.
Stewart, 78, an instrument since, denied the accusation to the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set the trial for January.
4 Tipps for Better underwater photos and Videos
If you want to make photographs or videos underwater, there is a choice of rumors.
The most coolpix option is a water poet shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action team like GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which have for about $300.
I have taken these photographs with several comrades of cameras, all available at less than $350.
Regardless of equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Take control of your equipment twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, you can assure that the battery and other rooftop classes are closed.
Imagine your camera on the photos or videos you want to take on.
Some cameras and Camcorder have scene and recording memodi, which optimizes timing for the Danish underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, consider until the depth of your equipment is workable.
Some cameras are allowed for up to 5 feet, while others are between 50 and 60 foot.
Try for conventional and water-density models in our shopping leaders and ratings.
Take in more than one - because many will not be shortened.
Poinand-Shoot-cameras usually do not have an LCD with which you can complicate images.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the right hiring is a lucky enough.
So you ’ re getting a lot of receipts.
If your camera has a rice mode that makes a series of assumptions with slightly changed conciliation, you use it.
Allow close to the surface.
Light is dramatically worse as you move away from the surface.
So, if you can keep you at the surface when you make takeovers in a pool, lake, or sea.
This allows you to get more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Consider the objects.
This is a good advice to land, too, but it is all the more important for poor terms under water.
It is particularly important if you work with a Action Cam: these devices often have a firm wheat rate, which means that you have to get thicker to your objects if you are to fill the full swamp.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the varieties whose nature changes things, even in a gigantic organization like NHS.
As a consultative anesthetic doctor, he devoted his career to saving the sick from both the agony of illness and the anguish of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, he was a MI6 employee, who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and disease are important to doctors, while the treatment is preoccupied with something else largely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose passage began.
"I have not felt me," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty getting over.
As he struggled with the grip-like symptoms, he observed that he made his wife Juliet impatient charges.
"I want things right now rather than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and alarmed with no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a X-ray investigation of his breast.
Just two weeks ago, he had gone to the tips in the French Alps.
The result of X-ray screening was a clear one.
He was suffering from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that infiltrates breast cancer.
As with most cancers, the exact cause is usually difficult to identify.
For example, while some smoking smoking suffers from lung cancer, not all lung cancers were previously smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an assistant burden, contact with the fiber that once was seen as a "miracle" drug, but was now seen as lethal.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbedev, after all, is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asset type has not been used in Britain since the 1960 ’ s, when industry voluntarily committed to not using it.
For example, wherever it was still deployed, only people in certain industries worked directly with trafficking, construction workers, cattle personnel, and advertising workers.
As an industrial driver of another time, it hardly seems worrisome today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Today, it seems, Britain is experiencing the peak of a Mesoltheliomb epidemic.
There are more Mesotheliom deaths than any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice the number of people die from this disease than from traffic accidents.
The Mesotheliom-Death Miloševils since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom.
The reason we have seen the deadly effects now, though Asbestos have been illegal for years (in 1999, all assistants were outlawed), is that a Mesotheliom only develops after decades.
And the scourge of the mesotheliome is not confined to construction workers.
Asbest was, and is often still, present in the homes in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn, and the businesses we buy.
Thus, Mesotheliom does not know classrooms, financial limits, professions, or age.
The privileged bastions, from elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The parliament building is in denial.
Even in the hospitals where we are to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen ’ s starting point has been interpreted.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a plumber.
Indeed, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he discovered it.
"It looks as if there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I had completed my education for six years." He wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors, and Pshaped - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could answer at least partly.
"Of the four doctors trained on Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last to live."
How many of us will be ill still?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed by 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
This was an unusually long time to survive.
Fifty percent of all mental illnesses die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends lethal.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us still get ill?"
Britain ’ s leading expert on Mesotheliom, professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the assistant epidemic in the UK is expected to disappear, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have died.
Most of these currently have no idea that they will die.

A brief glance at the files of the courts to which those affected are often addressed for compensation shows how widespread the scourge of the Mesotheliome is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks and Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had reliably exposed asbestos.
It worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the distribution of clothing to two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began to operate at M & S.
Now it has two children in the twenties.
"Before that," she says, "I never heard of Mesotheliom; I didn't even know about Asbestos.
I would never have imagined that this would affect me once.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word "ascendancy," a description of the structure of faculty that makes the clock resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for watchdogs, soccer platforms, raw risolation, soil isolation, even for brakes in cars.
It is less lethal than other assistants, but it is regarded by the EU and the WTO as a "great health risk" with possible death prospects.
But the more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestol (Crokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheses rates."
Marks & Spencer has been subjected to Alamy in the Flagship Store at Oxford Street, London, Asbest Alamy.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelithomer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her history is by no means unusual.
He has submitted a study by those who are affected that "a significant fraction of the mesotheliome without known labour or at home was probably caused by environmental asphylactic contacts."
Much of this contacts stems from the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
No one, it seems, can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, investigating the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been left unwittingly at the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service smiles and clothing were contaminated behind the parliament's committees with asbestos, whose deadly fiasers could be inflamed by something as benign as "strong air movements."
MPs are often blamed for addressing their own interests, but here the opposite appears to be true.
While the Director of the Parliamentary Labor Service has insisted that the Westminster Palace receive a "clean health credentials," it is now uncontroversial that £1 billion work effort must be raised over several years to renovate parliament, modernize electric installations, and remove the asbestos, and that, after the general election in 2015, lawmakers will probably have to meet at the nearby QE2 conferences rather than at the Westerners, as central banks.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the rules."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can now do is wait.
A person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbedience during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked at a hospital where asset charges have been decided positively," he says, "but I can not prove them in my case.
It is so difficult to recall all all all the places in which you have worked, and the data.
What he recalls is the day early December 2009, when he got that kind of fever.
He was 45, and late absent an operation.
Suddenly, I had a mock joke.
There was suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I believed that the drive was no longer going home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was wrought by the breast stroke around his lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesotheliom.
A month he did not go to work.
Outraged doctors made X-ray takeovers of his breast, and apply Pleurakather to exclude rivers and test in the laboratory.
But his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after sporting and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient received abbots with similar symptoms, and was subsequently diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But now, too, Abbott did not associate it with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
Abbott ’ s state deteriorated again in September 2011, and his housewife brought his CTSans and X-ray takeover to an expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-endowed sun was introduced into the cave between the grabs and the breast.
I am an optimist.
I just go on, "he says.
Frankly, I had not been so worried about that much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week: "It was told to me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott Termine had Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he grasp the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbestos turned out to be very common, especially in large public buildings where honor was often isolated with asbestos," he says.
People exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
As a result, Mesotheliom is now meeting younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipe of assimilation in hospitals has been underground, so patients have probably not been exposed to the clock.
But many of the staff who switched from one building to another (as Andrew Lavson) and underground canons (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with toxic substances.
It is clear that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have saved patients, but they are life-threatening to treatment doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their gang burner on assistants.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestos were frequently used in offices, businesses, libraries, and city halls, owing to their paternalistic and bloody characteristics.
Schools, too.
Indeed, many people may have had the first act of assisting in classrooms.
Across the country, thousands of chemists, students have dumped their gang burdens on assistants.
On Web sites, the issue of asbestos in schools is now often addressed.
Meanwhile, such innocent items have contained standard asbestos in our homes as soccer platforms and chuppetroleans.
"It is an industrial poison that contains much of our properties," Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that invaded a affected woman was the secession of a garrison in the 1970 ’ s.
So let ’ s adjust how you cut your garden screen.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to go on, but I noted that I could not focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I will not see another Christmas season.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspectives were on the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was by all the information to which he was right.
"It was very difficult to take up everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor" how long I still have? "
And I have been given about 12 months.
I remember that I thought "yes, I will not see another Christmas season.
"It was."
Mesotheliom is particularly insidious, because it is our life-support mechanism, the breathing itself, that causes lethal cancer.
Most Mesotheliom cases are caused by assisted tactics.
Asbest consists of small fibers.
When the asbestos are inflamed and the fibers inhalit, they can set themselves in a breast, skin around the lungs.
Assistants irritate breast predation and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhalized nadshaped assistants," says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiovascular Thorax doctor who changed Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital Andrew Lawson suspects that he faced asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliome.
Treasurers knew Lawson and treated a number of others who were probably also suspended during their hospital training.
Once the assistants reach the lung tissue, Treasurers says, "they are pushed to the margins by the respiratory procedure where the skin is.
From the outset, it is invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well for Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly contentious.
Some believe that it is worth trying.
Treasurers agree.
"You can not overlap the breast tally," he says.
They don ’ t get around the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer is not “good at chemotherapy, ” but does not cure," the "effect.
"Sometimes there are long-time survivors," says treasures.
But in the end they are all dying.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer, than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggles.
Having contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultative office four years after his diagnosis.
"Hallo, Cancer Center," he was wary of calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier, and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months, and his life was expected to be extended by just one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson managed "to make things appear in a somewhat more positive light."
Following the advice of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lazdunski, cardiovascular Thorax specialist on the Guy.
"We had an advantage by not having to be relegated, I simply called, and got a deadline," says Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for treatment to be authorized.
Money is essential to Mesothelioma ’ s disease to ensure that the best treatments are available.
But when these treatments invariably fail, many individuals are worried about another financial concern - about the future of the families that they leave behind.
So they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson countered Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos are extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 ’ s is the recognition that even a very small burden of health was a risk.
Here, corporate negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally joined the case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full-fledged compensation," because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his Mesotheliom was due to an assistant account in the Guy's.
After investigating his death, however, a Guy spokesman confirmed that "the assistants in the affected cell area were removed in the 1990's."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How Asbestos Can be Aut
Indeed, it is a huge problem for Mesotheliomb sufferers seeking compensation to attribute a firm's deadly asset account to a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance subsidies can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were strong new legislation this year that makes it easier for Mesothelioma individuals to charge compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law established an insurance industry fund of £350 million ($350 million) for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 could prove contact but can not prosecute anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court could have agreed to them in a normal compensation process – about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma numbers that £350 million was a "very good work" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers," he says, "and indicates that this sum is one-quarter of what insurers should have paid had time not gone away and Mesothelioma could find businesses and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then the labor and pension minister, also admitted that the law was "imperfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, with seven deaths per day, rapid action was needed.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelim Act's second hearing in December of last year.
At that point, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lazdunski for 19 months.
After its first deliberations, Long-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasure, would have a positive impact.
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – triple therapy, with Long-Lazdunski representing a survival rate of more than five years to 40%.
Abbott felt empowered.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.
Patients always see this.
There is something that allows you to go on.
If you fall precipitously, you will quickly be worse off.
Graham Abbott was subjected to the operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had the last six chemotherapy cycles.
Pursuans showed no sign of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancers surrounding my breast.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trail of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically strong.
They need to think about practical things - about money when I stop, for example, or show my wife how the Boilerage hire works.
If you get bad news, you will get negative.
They need to look forward.
When Ellie ’ s father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is not always easy.
"Parents make that hard," he says.
It is hard to know what to say, and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They responded differently.
Tamsin is healthy and bold.
She told her friends, and we soon got very many calls.
Ellie was more timid.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients must pursue.
But such talks are not hopeful for Mesothelioma ’ s disease, not a glimmer of hope for survival.
The disease (as it finally does for Stephen Jay Gould) provides a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses to vote Hong Kong in government, protestors proclaim retaliation.
On Sunday, despite greater calls for democratic reform, China ’ s parliament decided to nominate candidates for Hong Kong ’ s 2017 election.
This process is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong ’ s business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization of it within a few hours of denial.
The decision by the People ’ s Congress allows Communist leaders to reject all non-trivial candidates in principle.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said the right-wing expert Emily Lau, the leader of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
Hong Kong ’ s people have been attracted to their people.
And it is clear that we face an authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that permitting public nominations to be "chaotic" in Hong Kong's elections would be too messy for Hong Kong's government.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow the residents to elect the presidency by 2017.
China ’ s leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong ’ s citizens have a direct electoral law, but the decision also makes clear that China ’ s leaders remain firmly in the hands of a narrow Beijing nomination committee.
Moreover, after a new clause, only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" should be allowed.
The decision follows a summer when some of the biggest and most publicized protests have taken place in Hong Kong for many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong lies the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizations have threatened to close off the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, hundreds of Occupy Centre supporters gathered in the rain to Hong Kong ’ s government headquarters within a few hours of denial.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
But they did not approximate this, apparently to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In an online department, the organizers agreed that the movement "considered occupying the central district only a last resort, an action intended to take place only when all chances of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
It is tired of saying that all opportunities for dialogue are now being exhausted, and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong ’ s authorities have been preparing for Beijing ’ s announcement days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were strengthened on Sunday before the government buildings.
The unrest is being reinforced by the sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The addition of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central protests, because they jeopardized business activity, Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests that they speak could cause great economic damage depending on how many of their participants are, and how long they last," said Reinner Ip, a lawyer, who has long criticized the movement.
We don ’ t want to stoke fears that Hong Kong will spill out of control.
That impression is bad for investment.
China ’ s state-controlled media recently reported democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal vote on the rights of 780,000 people - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the region ’ s largest democratic demonstrations in history.
The tradition of school-butting in the US is now being transferred to universities where the private aircraft offers performances to friend ’ s presence.
We are happy to respond to this demand and offer the UK ’ s first luxury travel service to students today.
To achieve a particularly impressive university performance, the company also offers transport topics like private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten, or McLars P1.
Mr. Stewart also admitted that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who might otherwise have to put their hits through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach university with a minimum level of effort and maximum luxury this year.
One business spokesman said that no new book would yet exist, given that the service had just been established, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also told them that, despite tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for that supply.
Students today are very different in their expectations and entitlements from the students before 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF can do just that.
But the National Student Union criticized the service as abandoning it.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the US for Higher Education, said, "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis in living costs, because the available financial support in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep up with the soaring bills for the easiest livelihoods before they can even think that thousands of pounds are spending as simple as the arrival in the student residence.
Feminists criticize race and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Movement.
The participants turned their hands into the air and sang "hands high, not shooting," while waiting for funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of the unarmed team, Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender in front of the race to address reproductive law and income inequality.
But, while tensions rose in the Middle East and received attention across the country, Perez saw white women ’ s answers turn to 100% race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the students of August 9, personal essays came with titles like "Think of white women" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women."
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who talk about the whites and privileges in so high-class a way," she said.
People felt urged to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and because Ferguson ’ s situation is so racial that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed problems that black American women face every day, but that are not considered "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can publish some amusement on Facebook about me and my partner and praise 150 live everywhere," according to Mitchell.
When I ponder how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is obedient.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public sphere?" she asked.
There is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems for black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of quietly separating the issues; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were crafted, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynchmurder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white fighters analyzed the country for women ’ s suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, in the late nineteenth century, and found that the electoral struggle could succeed only for women or black.
"They made the decision to advocate for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for black people should come later," said Hattery.
When such things are remembered, one thing becomes aware of the power that non-white white women do not trust.
We have not done well on our job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
Nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the spate of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson -- police, racial discrimination -- is a mirror of the time when white feminine "boys played with the problems that black women have dealt with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be tolerable if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to control reception" asked Mitchell?
Second generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contractionary funds are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Stein went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian columnist, demanding more protests from white Americans about racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallels reason to understand a inherent danger to the body - and opinions that are markedly different in public opinion polls - will lead changes," wrote Stein.
Although stones stand for a more intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on race in America are puzzled.
Christina Sommers, an American Enterprise researcher and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are in contrast to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of specific programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently established a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, many feminists reacted in a futile way.
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that dominates mainstream feminism.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 undocumented minority people on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform has returned to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to reform immigration, said that, for a reconsideration of the issue, she must simply publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," says Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
"Swine Home" in Ipswich
The image of a house that was sold was removed from real-estate brokers when it became clear that it showed a big pig to be comfortable in a living room.
The freezing house has a bedroom, is on a private street in Ipswich, and is offered £120,000.
Among the details was a clearing of the house's living room - which included a pig that had his head dressed on a sofa.
Housing maker Connell said that the pig on the photo was the owner ’ s skin.
"The photo, however, was mistaken in publicity, and was removed" said one company spokesman.
In the House exposé, Connell described the previous assembly as a "unique family family with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the picture from the Web site, it still appears in advertising material.
House sales generated interest in social media when some asked whether the pig was contained in the purchase price.
Harvey ’ s SWF City is home to a new millionaire after Look Wage
A Harvard Locurator is Down This month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth takes time, with a happy winner receiving almost $1.1 million from cash-strapped on Saturday.
A Harvard newspaper kiosk for the second time in five years drew the jackpot to the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has yet to register.
The storeowner Steve Forward has said that the profits for conversation in the small city of Perth are available in the southwest.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is pretty much upset.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated profits in the first month of the last month, a decent degree for the state ’ s players for a few happy weeks.
Last week, a Canning Vale player of one of the five millionaires came in August, after a couple of Belmont earned $7.5 million in profits just a few weeks earlier.
The victorious few had been playing for twenty years, and said that the profits allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
Harvey ’ s millionaire is the 59th winner of the first WA division this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonies Pleony to the Gladiatorena
Not only did the Gladiators have their grasp deep in the game at the first Rhineland Day in leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract yesterday far more than 1,000 visitors braved by the speakers and the proverbial cold and enthusiastic about the historic spectacle.
There was a colorful stream of stories, recordings, games, pieces of exhibition, and information about the time of the Romans and their relevance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighter force of the Gladiatora School of Amor Mortis, which used every respite to demonstrate, with deviant sand repaired, their robust warrior.
Gladiatormen "Leonies" turned out to be humorous and knowledgeable, sending their men into the ring for heroic doubt in various guladiatorrs.

Ebola: West Africa ’ s Economy Burdens the Epidemic
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned, and international companies distance themselves.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealt a severe blow to West Africa ’ s economy.
Crop eradicates on fields that leave mines and markets are orphaned - the virus has severely increased the region.
Some international companies, too, are already distancing themselves.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic" vote by the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
The Hardest hit Liberia
"It is a complete catastrophe, we lose a lot of money," Alhaji Bamogo says, selling clothes on the second-largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
The market is only about who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, where more than 600 people were killed by fever alone.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease had prevailed in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
Overall, more than 1,500 people died, and thousands more were infected.
Foreign Companies Dump Workers
Companies operate everywhere in resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies like the steel company Arcelor Mittal are pulling off their employees, several international airlines no longer fly the affected regions.
Domestic traders and peasants are also responding: few people still leave their homes to resupply.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia under quarantine, among other things, export cacophony and coffee beans rot in the fields.
Farmers dare not to leave their homes for crop production.
Food Grows Out of Food
"People will travel less and less," Phillipe De Vreyer says, Paris experts on West Africa's economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables is preferable to stay at home.
As a result, people feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is running out of reach.
In markets, the supply of basic foodstuffs like rice is disappearing.
At the same time, the region that relies heavily on international companies risks losing its image – with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will shun the area fundamentally for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris.
What matters is how far and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression that "it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia," Hugon warns.
The disease also strains strained government budgets.
The disease also strains the already-strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody ’ s fears that their budgets will be heavily punished by high health-care spending and, in addition to deteriorating economies.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to help the countries affected by health systems of $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are also evident in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
To be sure, the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But, elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of contagion.
Hotels ’ reservations, too, are falling sharply.

Stewart went against the Wall for the second time after his real crackdown in Round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart sucked his damaged car into the garage, leaving it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said that his 14-headed team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race next weekend in Jumond, Virginia.

Like many others, the jazz group is creating in secondary schools for year on TV.
After the summer vacations, some groups have decimated sharply.
Now they are searching for a sports that is healthy and enjoys great futility.
In the two jazz and modern-day Dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly the singer in the jazz and Modern Dance Formation of Dance "Spirits, only nine children remain.
"Three in the Group of Eight to Twenty-Years, six in the group of 12 to 15," tell the 20-year-olds.
With more assets, the whole thing would enjoy a lot more "you could dance very different choreography," she says.
Those with a pleasure for tubes can go from 17 to 18 p.m., or freezing between 17 and 18.30, at the time of former hotel meyer, Free Road 9, to the barrel of a training hour.
"Training regularly begins with an upward overseas program," the trainer tells.
Then various choreography is used.
JazzDance has the trait that there is no established form, and thus is open to many styles.
Elements from torture classes to sports and acrobatics are processed in the Jazz Dance.
Of course, there is no shortage of sense of urgency.
"We are eating, guessing tanks, and we have also surpassed in the area of tanks," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group, one can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby, and do a lot more for one ’ s motor development.
To be sure, this is not a jazz who can be nudged into one of the other offers of TV year.

Bulgarian Inmates protest nationwide.
Hundreds of prisoners from across Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest prior to the Department of Justice in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently amended.
Higher salaries are also on a scorecard to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours, and are calling for a return to the earlier 24-hour classes.
Despite meetings between the Department of Justice ’ s prison and Justice Representatives, the Bulgarian national Ratio (BNR) union was not reached.
The negotiations last, Director-General for punitive action, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.

Ukraine ’ s Army abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters remain on the rise.
Ukraine ’ s army, Monday, abandoned Luhansk ’ s airport after heavy battles allegedly involving Russian tank bases.
The army also told us that seven soldiers had been killed over the past 24 hours.
Ukraine ’ s President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel from his army ’ s severe defeat in the fight against the separatists, presenting changes in the top army leadership with no detail.
Russia ’ s Separatists Bringed Airplanes
In the struggle against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have once again fired a warplane and two military helicopters.
Roughly 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents on Monday by Russian agencies.
Suspicions of the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed that for the first time in the Soviet Sea, two boats of Ukraine ’ s coastal guard were sinking.
Ukraine ’ s border protection confirmed that two of its ships had come under fire near the port of Mariupol on Sunday.
Yet seven border protectors had been injured, a Kiev spokesman said to the station 112.
Two occupying members were deemed missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several Donetsk cities under control.
The Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
The Ukrainian Contact Group now meets Minsk, Belarus ’ s capital, Minsk.

In advance, all actors used their appearances to announce their demand for public disclosure.
NATO ’ s Not Negotiation of Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday, NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council agreement.
The NATO leader, however, accused Russia of "a sharp rupture" of the deal.
"Today, we must confront reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," Rasmussen argues.
Russian documents and statements emphasize that "they view us as adversaries."
A Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to increase NATO ’ s presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan," agreed at the NATO summit in Wales, would ensure that "we have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks.
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were set for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for the European Union to decide whether it will also end a representative to the talks.
Ukraine ’ s gas price dispute means that it has not received a fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had brokered between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could cut off gas supplies for Europe as well.
Europe derives roughly one-third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which Ukraine flows.
Merkel Speaks the Work of Power
Now, once again, the Chancellor is clearly committed to this.
But it is not a free pass for any complicated detail.
The CDU ’ s persistent concerns about the PK-Mview have mounted the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, after persistent opposition from her CDU, has spoken in terms of introducing a Pkesh mode.
"To put it bluntly, it is in the Coalition Treaty, and it will come," said Party Chair on Monday after meeting of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
But Merkel did not set out for the time being on a detailed model.
The black red government program calls "certain parameters."
German Minister of State Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and that now goes on."
The NRC CDU, however, insists on its rejection of a mosquito watch just across the street.
Merkel emphasized that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also engage constructively in consultations of a bill.
Beyond the issue, he has also talked about more opportunities to activate more private capital for infrastructure investment, including broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special about it." Schäuble had uncompromised a "mirror" report on Sunday, and his house is vetoing a concept to pay most-revenue highway investors for after the election of 2017.
Horst Seehower, CSU ’ s leader, then warned that he should develop motor concepts in the cabinet against the leading minister.
CDOs Armin Laschet reinforced his objections.
The "Coalition Treaty never assumed to support all councils and federal roads," said the North-Rhine-West CDU leader.
So it is an important signal that naval owners have now announced that they are again talking about the issue.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU ’ s Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz associations.
The background is concern that a gauge will affect small border crossings with neighboring states.
Maritime owners had demanded coalition support for the voter criticism of the Christian Democratic Union.
The left views plans as failing in the face of disputes in the Union.
"The Murdoch viewer is dead," said Party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabulary newspaper."
"The string fails," Dobrindt wants to establish a livestock service on all German roads to be launched in 2016.
But, according to the Coalition Treaty, Dutch autoowners must not be adversely burdened.
So they should be given full balance over the KFK tax.
But under EU law, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misinterpreted
One British says that she thought that she had died for many years as a result of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
Indeed, it suffered from Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and backbone.
Charity CMT told the UK that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT, because so little is known about the disease.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are likely to suffer from CMT, which can result in motor disorders like muscle weakness, insecure walking, and broken marriage.
Disease also suffers from feelings of tumult or pain, and the disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodger was 13, she believed that she was suffering from peace axie (FA) - a disease with very poor prospects for survival.
Rodger thought she would sit in a rollercoaster before she became 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "When I knew I could not do the same as others.
I fell steadily, and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never drive rolls or skateboard with other children, and I was often left in school for my way and running dry.
Rodgers said that she had left the rock at age 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles and frighten her feet, when her doctor left the room and read she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I told no one, but I went home, searched for the library of the disease, and wrote to FA society," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shot and horribly panicked.
I thought that I would be in a rollercoaster with 18 and die with 25, and slowly lose my ability.
I did all this with me alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said when she became 17, it became clear that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined, and she asked her doctor.
He simply stood up and embraced me, saying, "My love, I don't think you will be hasty, or you will go on a roll."
I believe you have a little less life-threatening way.
After some genetic tests, its CMT was diagnosed.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt as if I were a thinner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareni-month to highlight the disease.

Yet death toll appears every month at the heart of the biosphere of the Swedish Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they must be divided on the ground.
A deafening bone hits the exploitation at the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was on the troop rollout of Munisings, closed after 110 years of military operations in late 2005.
Since that time, the 6500 hectares (6500-square miles) of the biosphere area of the Swedish Alb, opened to 13 separate paths for migrants and cyclists.
The tax burden on businesspeople in the room in Washington rises as the economy recovers.
A recovery means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State-owned and local tax modest for domestic companies grew slightly over the past year, while economic recovery accelerated, a new study last week, and firms in the area of Washington were no exception.
District, Maryland, and Virginia companies collectively paid $27.6 billion in government and local fiscal positions in 2013, a 3.8% increase in 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.3% last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth that followed the declines over the several years of 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young and the center for state taxation.
More than half of the tax revenue from the district, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Maryland receives from companies.
Virginia gets the lowest tax revenue from companies, at 28%.
Much of the increase in tax revenues stems from a recovery in companies ’ real-estate values, according to researchers, which led to a 3.7% increase in property taxes this year, after the three consecutive years, to less than 1%.
While much of the profits come from large states like California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to be in favor of Washington as well.
District, Maryland, and Virginia companies collectively paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared with $9.6 billion in 2012 – a 4.2% increase over a year.
But the apparent recovery of real estate values is not so effective in raising government and local tax revenues in Maryland, because property taxes amount to just over one-fifth of companies ’ tax modest.
Virginia and D. C. companies pay almost half of their state and local taxes in property taxes.
"Maryland is doing this: a large part of real estate, especially in the tax area around D. C., is either owned by government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other countries provide.
The recent recovery of tax revenues by companies can not be expected only to recover the housing market.
Company revenues also seem to be recovering, the data suggest.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at government agencies of $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland captured $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not rise evenly in all three places.
The upward rate in the district was 4.3% on the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax rate of 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest personal income taxes (in all three, there are fixed corporate-tax rates), at 6% in all three branches of government.
The Maryland corporate-tax rate is 8.25%, and a relatively high 9.975% in the district.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia requires lower state and local corporate taxes, and a broader tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed legislation to lower its corporate-tax rate from 6.9% to 6% this year, the same as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5% next year.
If the government continues to meet its income targets next year, the legislation could reduce the government ’ s corporate-income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in Washington seem to be doing better, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen – a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized – grew by 20% in the district, Maryland, and viginia last year, to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes will likely continue throughout the country this year, with overall VAT revenue for government and local governments increasing 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 relative to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the room for Washington may lag behind if the federal government ’ s spending cuts affect the region ’ s labor market.
Partnerships: German Bier for Guangzhou
Hopes and Malz -- even in China -- have a popular combination.
Germany ’ s beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt ’ s partner city in China now wants a brake, and hopes for a flight connection between the two cities.
Germany's Bier, breached in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - is the urgent desire of Chinese officials.
"We would be very happy to see a German brake down in our city," Li Yiwei, Deputy Party Secretary of South China's metropolis, said when he visited his city for SPD delegation this week.
Time and again, the official of China ’ s ruling Communist Party (CCP) came back as the conversation settled this concern for the twelve millions-metropolis metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called Kanton in Germany, is one of China ’ s richest cities, warb Li.
As a result, people have the purchasing power to afford German beers.
The Hessian SPD leader Thorsten Schäfer-Gülen, who led Germany ’ s delegation to the political delegation, admitted to the host that he would switch in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain, and pleasure," he added to lunch with Guangzhou's party upper.
That pleasure of life is already sneaking Mr. Li, flattering the host.
In response, Guangzhou's officials met with Schäfer-Gümble, albeit with rotation, who was served on food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brains.
Tsingtao beer is bridged for the German purity imperative.
More Commerce Out
A second desire by the Chinese hosts would be a flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice Party leader Li said.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight before, but slashed in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," local politicians were convinced.
"Trade between our two cities is growing ever more."
Rich now must take the way through Changsha in Hunan province, Li lamented.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital, Guangzhou, also hopes for the airline.
The province ’ s Vice Governor, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this desire to talk to the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," he replied, Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimer German Kenyan, nodded in agreement.
Coupled Partnership
Guangzhou ’ s lively deputy leader hopes that he can visit Frankfurt to a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in that function.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor was forced out of office on corruption charges.
Wan Qinglian, the local leader, also had to go.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked before his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was the top official in Fujian, where the automobile VW built a big work.
Frankfurt officially committed more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection with Guangzhou, 9,000 miles away, is among those who are cultivated by both sides, for example, with a swap of pupils.
Last year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the flow of perles are almost as strong as they are with economic power.
Next year, it wanted to reach a GDP of €250 billion, Li reported.
Joan Rivers's family of Joan Rivers "depresses the thumbs."
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter has shown hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her disease.
"Thank your continuing love and support," Melissa Rivers said today.
We are all pushing the thumbs.
Her mother, according to sources on Thursday after an emergency, was placed in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, where Mount Sinai hospital.
Doctors deliberately hold them seated and closely monitored until they remain more satisfied with their state of affairs, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reaction came from many sides, including an overwhelming online sport of Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental Savings and Rising Wages
For cars and vacationers tracking today, environmental standards will be stricter in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new dumpers will receive a label from September 1, when the buyer can see key data like the device ’ s energy efficiency.
New cars apply to the pollutant class "euro 6" stricter stick oxide.
There is also more money for the armed farmers: they get a minimum national wage of €10.25.
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported morning on Monday: the online retailer and video producer, and a variety of other things, the video services Twitch buys for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to take over, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if selling Twitch to Google ’ s video service was a good thing for a cool billion people, and cooperation seemed natural.
Twitch, established only three years ago when Justin.tv was launched as a general distribution service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players willing to publish their bridges in games, an insider says, a "YouTube for live games."
The Twitter interface.
And let's play, a video genre in which better guards give the (mostly older) games a taint of intelligence theater, is already very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often mentioned if Twitch is to be described, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was received somewhat from the news, a textbook example of an established engineer who buys a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the YouTube deal failed because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know for the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, honestly, is Twitch ’ s incredible success.
For Snobs like me who explain that they prefer to exercise rather than watch it, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes watching others at Games rather than taking control of even the controlling account.
It is one thing to watch a friend at 3 in the morning over her shoulders as she is easy for RePresident Evil to watch a spinner as he is shot in mind 20 times later in Call of Duty.
All these games you could now look at.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego-Games, so, in the absence of control of one ’ s control over the outlook, concession can be a really good recipe for headache.
I admit that the highways in which the Red Bannisters of our electronic age graduate whole games are entertaining.
But so long as a game or human virtual is not involved, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know of this?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month, the fourth largest source of Internet traffic jitters.
And how, exactly, do Amazon want to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video just as YouTube could have swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has what every company would like: thousands of young men who are promoted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said Amazon and Twitch, "both believe in Gaming's future," and the medium shows no sign of contraction, not even swallow - as a sport of hope.
On the hip at the burqartenburg floor, a lot was on the sun.
The concept of the ancients was voting.
Despite the strong rainy committee on Saturday, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-Air fest in the burggarten.
At times, forgiveness had to be stopped.
"It was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel's light and fun.
Two Spanish words, Maxim Sem and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
For the Open Air in the salt of salt burggarten is set to broadcast brightness the day and evening through Shows.
Na, and the fun comes of his own.
That turned out to be early Sunday, when the first visitors to the Open Air appeared.
A test for all generations had promised the organizers.
And they have.
Across the supply side, salt coins and guests from nearby and further surrounding burqa had made it mockery.
They pursued the first live stations, flattened by the Pact, enjoyed bold drinks - in short order: relaxation and pleasure.
And that is what generations have conveniently done.
Whereas one on a ceiling on the extra-ticket white sand dreamed at the stunteeth, others boasted on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the desert killed on the hip bourgeois, a big magnet for the smaller guests.
But, even at child mines, volunteer workers had their hands literally to do with the word in order to cope with the primacy and disparage imaginative creations into the small faces.
The larger people used the Kickertic or participated in a Satebodic workshop expelled by the Goodfoot-Crew of Salzwedel.
Until the big rains came.
Soon before 17,30, he boasted to visitors, especially families searched for wheat and dry.
But the attractiveness of the mainland did not stop there.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, referring to "success on the whole front."
As a result, there is nothing wrong with a repeat of the big party next year.
While the Events ’ content and size still needs to be worked, he made clear of the referendum on Sunday in a first balance sheet.
Curiously, he said that forgiveness had to be stopped in the interim.
Obviously, the security firm had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid failed to get into the facility.
The resonance was very good.
In a first conservative estimate, the salt song spoke of a co-organizer of about 1,200 visitors in the burggarts.
There were problems with ton technology.
So the smuggling Hip-Hop-Band Blocks' outspoken Rox broke her demise.
Teachers were unable to create a half-way reasonable soil.
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built because tents could not be brought to salt tissue because of a rice panel.
"Next year, they will be," they said.
The premiums of the Amula-Open-Air had more than succeeded in visitors.
And it ’ s bad weather.
But the ages have committed some of the mistakes that will be made for the first time, but must be removed at the second order.
In the social networks of Facebook, too, the old criticisms must be pronounced.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros, you just expected more" Melanie Meier on the side of the event.
"You, sadly, have a little taken over," says Ele Zimmermann.
Others do not see the initial problems so narrowly.
I find it very good that some not only square foolish, but really try to get on their feet.
Hate away! "Stephanie Jenß writes to Amula.
Now it remains a year for the events to set off these criticisms.
The New Radome in Berkum
This is not expected.
Instead, the willing piece of construction is waiting to be deployed to the market.
The action is in the context of a larger move: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observer TIRA, the buzz, the Radoma, is being restored altogether.
The new radar will be slightly smaller than the old one, with a 47.5 meters in diameter.
But size remains the world record.
The final step toward completing the new shell is scarce exchange.
The top quarter of the old hill are separated and cut off with a crawl.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell will be set.
To the extent that the weather plays, the action is to be played at the beginning of this week.
Making part of the Ice Bucket Challenge is Burning Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom wrote so much when their skewed water was dumped that it injured the bone structure of their face.
The Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was placed in the hospital after shooting so much at Ice Bucket challenge that she broke out the kidney.
Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom drowned so much when their skewed water was dumped that it violated their facility.
"Water was so cold that I read, and while I'm doing so, my kidney remained simple," she said of The Mirror.
Iron water is being shaken over 20 years.
The Internal Roberts of Seconds
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn ’ t go, the kidney was hailed, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this, and almost went into the doom before laughs, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-olds of the United Kingdom were placed in the hospital to reburn the kidney after participating in the viral trend on the Tuesday.
The clip was reduced to Internet sensation and thousands on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the burglomers about to return to a strain?
Most recently, there has been a wild split between the two classmates of Burgunite.
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
The late Richard Dimbath, a former CEO of the Wolfratshman Burgfrean, led the project in French Guédelon as a model for the rebuilding of the Wolftshman Burg.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the burgl-sharing club and the burgfriends of clouds.
It seemed very different so far that the views of how to deal with the history of the Wolfshouse Burg and possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving together: talk of common action is set to begin soon.
This confirms the heads of the United Nations, Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein), and Herbert Piffl (Burgfrig), of our newspaper ’ s demand.
"I have called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both sets of legs could walk back to one priority in the future.
So there have been visible successes faster.
Whereas the burgfriends for the newly deceased Richard Dimbath have seen a reconstruction of the burg on the mounwald, for the burgverein of Sjöberg the "development and delivery" of money comes first.
Herbert Piffl, the Chief Executive of the Burgfriend ’ s dog, has been very happy to say his own words.
Since Dimbath ’ s death, he has been on the horizon.
A new chair is due to be found in a member assembly in mid-September.
At the moment, the club, according to 74-year-olds, counts on some 40 members.
"After my friend Richard Dimbath's death, we have at first set the stage of respect for unifying activities," a "a mindset" that was needed to "consider how to go on."
According to Piffl, the new leader will go into the conversation with the burgl-sharing.
Until then, the Burgfriend may also now have a contemporary mood within its grouping.
Piffl says one candidate for the presidency is not there yet.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself"; he does not want to run for his apartment in Bad Toil-z.
The new chair should be a wolf designer.
The tanks want to go along with the project, "but they like to keep working."
The divergences of views on reconstruction are likely to persist soon in Piffl ’ s eyes.
He rewards Dimbath as a "missionary" who believed in rebuilding the burg.
Two similar, well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
They are a tourist magnet, as well as voluntary volunteers from around the world.
Piffl: "I, too, was skeptical at the outset.
But, over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project, "creating a" one-on-one "feature for the city's city.
After all, there is nothing else.
Moreover, Piffl believes that the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets, and potential sponsors.
"I personally don't want to throw my breath over" he hopes that the burgverein might be heading somewhat.
Their goal of first documenting history is "important and good."
Then one could look further.
Smarter Path to Save in Uni-Teachers
Since the cost of universal textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, a clever austerity ideal was considered.
He invented a body system for books by students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay returning.
"My mathematics book normally costs $180, but I got $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A Keks," said Schroeder, 19 who visited Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college manship said that students spend, on average, more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and studies, but that there are various cost conferences for students.
Online shops and creative approaches, such as Schroeders, are increasingly the solution to the choice for students.
The rents of textbooks become more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than for buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campuses, said that the rents of textbooks had doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books were mixed in college bookstores in the past spring, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here, one-way one is for the best deal.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one-third of the price for which they are on campus.
The ninth issue of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be used for the specialized textbook trader Chegg.com for $239.99.
Wanted to Buy
If one of the notes of other, or normal, uses of use, is a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25 graduate student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a necessary “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business Business Business. ”
The book was sold for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, the head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors whether past spending is permissible.
Sometimes, updates are not relevant to seminary work.
In such cases, older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of spending the latest.
Beyond Chegg and Amazon, Half.com of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to needed books.
Mixed
The rents of textbooks are worth considering when you treat them reasonably well, remember giving them back, and don ’ t want to keep the books after they finish.
They can save more than 80% of the costs of a newly bought book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Informing the provisions of the deal in which you rallied, including the penalty fees that may fall for writing notes, underutilized, or used donations.
To me, if you don ’ t give back the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-boats, rather than traditional textbooks, are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto mixed up, with an electronic license provided for a specific period by wholesale dealers like Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inccus.
Chegg can earn "Calculus" for about $61 for 6 months.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, because many classics nowadays can be downloaded at no cost, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Certainly, we are looking around.
Joe Gault, 29 who will soon visit Pepperdine Law School, recommends that the ISBN-Number be priced on books, because one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And, before an online aversion, Gault says, one should examine whether the book is actually preventive.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery, and eventually paid the full price in college camps.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" became no barracks?
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill A" played only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape," cited on Cameron Diaz, played only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while child movies like "dragon tables" also disappoint 2.
An article by the telegraph Robbie Collin suggests that children ’ s movies may reflect the lack of quality of film quality.
Collin used to describe 2014 as "the worst year" for child movies and described "dragon stories" as a purely "functional" fantasy.
But films for a slightly older target seem like the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rate for every summer start shown between the US Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and at least 2,000 lone wins this year.
The results are based on the views of movies and filmmakers, pointing out that this year ’ s filmmaking is synonymous with that of the past year.
Some commentators argue that development stems from changing seaweed habits and the growing popularity of Web Street services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is now working on Disney's soon-to-be-released jungle-bugging film, told Hollywood Reporters of Web site, "I believe that times are changing."
We need to accept this, not try to do the past.
In recent times, unlike the Hollywood products ’ currently feeble cascading results, net flix was selling $1.2 billion to the Streaming content, nearly twice the rate of last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, the director Steven Plaberg criticized film studies for focusing too much on Comics's filmmakers, predicting a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its grim prophecy may well contain a true core.
The potential barracks to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, minions, and Jurassic World, are all more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the fall in the cascade results as simple "cyclical," saying to Hollywood Reporters, "The next summer will be the largest city of the Chilocasus ever, and no one will worry about business anymore."
This was a step in the right direction when the 2 th Tibetan district was removed a few years ago.
Now the German tabloid has launched an additional 3 Bundesliga.
As a result, those who did not rise have moved up.
For example, although Göttingen ’ s most classic team, Torpedo, has avoided the decline in the upper season, only fifth is playing.
Fourth classic remains Torpedo ’ s name, despite its grandiose march to the regional Alliance.
The boys and girls of Torpedo were killed in the lower list, as were the boys of the SC.
The SGG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserve are running in the new criminal lifeline in which Göttinger clubs no longer represent.
The TTV is playing Geismar in the exile league, the Torpedo branches in the national league.
What looks like a better circuit class is now the new cyclone, South.
Here, TSV Seulses, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, loudspeaker, FC being, and the TC.
In the District League, Dransfeld and the SC play as regional representatives, where the TTC II districts, Rot White, the Bovender SV II, and TTTV ’ s teams Geismar II and III ’ s District League are at least beginning to strengthen.
Güntersen, the TTC, and the TTV Geismar II are with the games.
In the District League, Torpedo III and the Sshadoses/desertillas are in the making.
With Nine teams
The SC is sending his girls into the small district league.
Nor is the township staffle of the SCF boys -- where Torpedo II is still underway -- complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende, and the Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly established Regional Association, the two gods started with nine teams.
In the West ’ s season, Red White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV, and V, MTV Grone, Dransfields of SC II, mielephants, and SG LG II are all in the second.
In the east season, among other things, Sattensen/Wöllshausen, Nikolausberg, and Land swaps play.
The Damen-Kreiliga League consists of Sshadoses/Wrillshausen II, imagery, shirts, souls II, Tuspo Weende, and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of the East, where there are no teams of Damand at the center at all.
Conspicuously, none of the six. Setting strength should be achieved, the innovative and transformative circuit board will have to start thinking once.
NATO ’ s Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the heart of Newport at an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff to hold a so-called counter-summit there.
Stephen Fairclough haunted us on weekend, speaking to demonstrators traveled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Driving Teenagers from the Blue Mountain
ZWEI ’ s youthful bugs were secured by the silk winds after they trapped the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke on their tour soon after Sunday in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives at about 20 p.m. called the police when the two had not returned home.
An addictive group of local police and bailout agencies broke out, and the couple was found at about 23 p.m. near the Bridal Veil, where water was found.
The girl had injured on his knees, and the man had overthrown, and had turned his head.
Bailers stayed with the couple overnight, and were expelled tomorrow on Monday.
They were placed in a state of stability with a health car in the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Escalating the Government\ u0027s Protests in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 demonstrators had been driven by soldiers from the PTV buildings, said Pervaiz Rashid, Minister of Information.
The station, after more than half an hour, has resumed broadcast.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the troubled protesters would have damaged equipment in the Redaction.
Death or injuries were not reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the leader whom they accuse of fraud.
The police said that roughly a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ’ s residence had brought together again on Monday of roughly 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
A policeman was injured after hospital charges.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to enter Sharia ’ s residence.
They demand the prime minister ’ s resignation.
The powerful military had called on a political solution to the conflict on Sunday after a meeting in the army headquarters "to waste time and use no violence."
More broadly, "the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the state's security."
The escalating violence has stoked concern about the military ’ s intervention, which in the past has been more common.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and Preachers Tahirul Qadri have continued since the independence Day of August 14.
Sharif rejects a resignation.
Khan and Qadri called on their followers to stay on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri was similar.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May with cheating.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
An interim government is said to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 4,000 security forces are in use to protect the government ’ s fourth.
The protesters initially had been peacefully shut out before the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them on weekend to enter Sharif ’ s residence.
Shelf villages, after a second season victory, have three of the taboos.
With 2: 0 above green, a bitter week for Rapid has come to an conciliatory end on Sunday.
"Victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had achieved a swimming chief in the European League on Thursday.
"Success was uncanny," the captain and tumor protection of Steffen Hofmann, who was in three place with green whites.
Schrammel trauma brings Rapid to the Seventh Rapid Strait with the second Saisoni victory demonstrated the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki, and goes into the country ’ s game of success.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Defenders Thomas Schrammel, who, with his glorious sixteenth-century leader, set sway for victory in the 14th Minute.
"I thought I was shut down all the fruit of Thursday and smiled him under the latte," said the 26-year-old.
When Schramming on November 13, 2010, had hit a federal debt for the last time, Ried still.
So the first championship campaign in the paper stress will remain a special reminder.
"For me this is something special, I am out of the paper grew," said Schrommle.
Mario Pavelic ’ s short-term prayer of Becken-Blessings made his cause very good by relying on the left to defend the right side.
He has enough experience that he can invert that position.
He deserved the goal; he already earned a few assists this year. "
The character of the team also shows the flank to 2: 0 by the court after well over an hour that finally brought the decision.
For before that, the guests might well have been able to write.
"Thanks to God, we have had some luck today," so has Schroeder, who played on the shooting of performance and result in recent weeks, remarking that "the results have not been true, but the players have always been good at last year."
Barisic even found "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team played in this season."
So the first bell since July 26 demonstrated that the team ’ s fabric was intact, despite its setbacks: "Today, my team showed that it was in character."
To him, he is not even more pleasant: "That we have finally played too zero."
Much work during the country ’ s breathing space also happens to sue Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar, and Michael Schimpelsberger for several defaults, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philipp Schobesberger made the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," Barisic, who lost with funeral and Pavelic players in the past three days, "who have recently been very stable."
So the recess of countries must be used to "empty wounds and put a little little in the physical realm," Barisic declared, with five U21 delusions in his ranks.
One to which the pause may come most is captain Hofmann.
He is riven up for the team, bedeviled by pain.
It is during this severe period that he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "contained barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the structure to the paper before he exchanged it in the 68th minute, but also got the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350 federal game, it was the first meeting of the game since November 2, 2013 (4 to 2 above the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that all is good now," we have certainly had some luck, but luck must come back at some point.
Now it's high time, "Hofmann said.
But he urged concentrated work: "You can not always see it in black and white.
We have not played as badly as this has been shown in recent weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now, either.
He could not deny the importance of his role in the team.
It is a very young team that I can help at the moment.
"Hofmann said.
Grödig-coach Michael Baur had little accusation of his team and his team.
He regretted the rapidly countervailing "from the magic class," as well as the regular gate of nicotine in the 40th minute detected by referees of columnists.
The only accusation that I can make for the team is that we were not concrete enough toward the goal in some stages.
There are too few conclusions here.
Domestic defenders Maximilian Karner saw the same thing: "It started badly, but then we found ourselves pure and even a goal.
By and large, more would have been in place.
There is Ruh under this Violence
A powerful tribe of tribe showed us at our dispersal of the summer series "My play of Rhine Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still reside in the countryside, with educated copies being the "scourge home" of underground broadcasters.
A bumpy football path adds to the roughly 600 years old oath.
It is over to stop peaks, basement shops, and bastard seaports.
A piece beneath the stone's collapse from the peasant sberg, a kilometer north of the road to the White Bach, because it stands.
Vital looks like a natural memorial, looking beyond the other trees of the environment, and reminiscent of an American mammograph of more than eight feet.
A small budda on a building post suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intensive investigations, there was only evidence of the common sense.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consumed the Bishell Archiv, asking older people from the underground floor to learn what relatives it has with the scourge.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation of the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the brick herders were to have driven their animals from underground blades to the tired and liberated by stones.
On the scale of the tree, the animal guardians exhausted from rise are said to have exhausted.
Now it has regained its relevance, because the Viennese actually resurrect brick herds.
The field has also been made a biospheric reserve area, and Schneider has continued to be found.
But caution should be maintained at the behest of the stone assemblies, because the bastard that the sun craves is also a popular whereabouts for cancer mothers.
A migration route moves from underground belt to tree, but it is hidden.
More pathways have been depicted, the direction goes upwards, and invited to widespread migration.
Where is the Water burg?
But a water bourgeois rarely seen at our next task.
Seasement is a good thing about the building plant, but we have some historical construction in the countryside to which the building confei could fit.
Where is our "piece of beautiful luck"?

Like previous series of the Main Post in Post in recent years, there is a return to prices this year when they have the right solution.
Those who like to focus can also go along.
Under the e-mail address, newtown @ mainpostde, you can tell us the solution, as well as your personal "piece of the X-ray luck" under that stick.

After weeks of tumult, Italy ’ s prime minister and acting EU leader, Matteo Renzi, enforced the nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, against strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s special summit in the EU, and will succeed British Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton.
Renzi regards the regime-linked newspaper La Repubblica as reasserting the appointment of Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, as a favorite of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to silence the left-wing base that he constantly cracks down on, because Mogherini is assigned it, albeit more moderately.
Donald Tusk, the Conservative Representative with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council, said the prevailing opinion in Rome in order to achieve political reconciliation.
For the EU ’ s chief diplomacy will simultaneously become a commissioner for President Juncker.
The EU parliament ’ s outstanding approval is regarded as safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano might not have called the nomination of Italy's 41-year-old leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important acknowledgement" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is a widespread optimism that Mogherini, who has been proven in Party offices for almost two decades, will be "huge challenges" for her ambition.
The mountainous rabble-rousers are married and have two daughters.
Her party career began the graduate political scientist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), which, in 2008, pitted together with the Catholic centrist Margherita party, to today ’ s Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Jungsocialist) for three years.
With the election of 2001, she entered the high party politics with the contention of the Left Democrats, working in the foreign policy department that she soon became head of.
It has occupied traditional focus on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, known by studies of NATO use in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, and nurtured contacts with the European Social Democrats and Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, it has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies in Defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as Secretary of State.
If the PD now retains a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement, which contributed more than 40% of the party ’ s vote in the May EU election, then, as PD circles noted, Federica Mogherini participated in it.
The lectures in Brussels that the EU ’ s new foreign officials have too little diplomatic experience, so they lack substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherinis, who are not cosmopolitan, are being prosecuted as a "go-friendly" policy.
It favors the Russian-run pipeline South Stream, which bypasses Ukraine ’ s natural gas directly to southern Europe, which also provides energy security for Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU leader in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
In Brussels, photographs showing them with Putin in Shake-hands were received with outrage, as were invited by the Kremlin ’ s leader for October to a Mailland Economic Summit.
Overall nine young people began their education at embryonic Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This implies an Azubi that has already completed another training in the company.
Four training occupations will continue to operate: electronicians (three training), meatronists (two), toolbox mechanics (two), and procedural mechanics (two).
All the holidays from the countryside of Sweden: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bucherl of Black Chess, Stefan Brickl, and Florian Rewitzer of Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer of Neunburg presumably forest, Felix Domaier of overview, Daniel Sorgenfree, and Sebastian of PFremd ’ s dentials and Ferdinl Strebz of Teunz.
The new education numbers previously visited primary and middle-school education, respectively.
From Wednesday to Friday, the training of all cohorts, and instructors, from Wednesday to midwife, are entering an injunction, where, among other things, a full-scale migration and reafening is on the agenda.
The company counts heavily in Germany in 435 and 950 in the world.
The number of instructions is distributed throughout the millennium.
The French Socialists should "shut their mouth and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show its love" for the controversial Socialist president whose cabinet-reeducation has been discredited by the large majority of French.
The president deserves everyone ’ s respect; he deserves our loyalty; he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stick with his side," he said at great applause.
As a salient gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France ’ s controversial 35-hour week, despite strong demands for a relaxation of the regulation of sides of Emmanuel Macrons, the new economy minister.
On Saturday on Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialist to show himself "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Attorney General, is riding her sand in the drumbeat when she attended a meeting of defective socialist deputies and criticized the Socialist Party for "taking the French believe in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, derided Socialists ’ perpetual infighting, saying that she could not imagine the new Valls government holding through for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor with no clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no need to form a new government when the old one has not survived a summer.
"And the new, too, will not survive the autumn or winter," said Fce Le Pen to supporters.
She reiterated her party ’ s call for a parliamentary breakup, saying that she was confident that she would emerge victorious in early elections and be willing to govern.
The ruling French party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March, and the right-wing National Front led the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday journal du Disome found that 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande ’ s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government failed to improve the economy and retail numbers.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must feel rapidly that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL O, the world ’ s third-largest crusader, is engaged in advanced negotiations, according to industry experts, to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would include Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury Cruises ’ s aircraft and the affluence of Cruises, while competition with major rivals like Royal Caribbean Crubean Ltd (RCL N) and Carnival Corp (CCL).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could end no more.
Owners of Prestige Cruises, Apollo Global Management LC (APO), also own a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources were asked to remain anonymous, because the negotiations were not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to pleas for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Miami company Norwegian Cruise is conducting 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America, and the Caribbean.
Its revenues stood at $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also populated in Miami, operates under brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa, and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, a 6% increase from the previous year.
The cruising industry as a whole is around $29 billion, and the next few years expect it to be expected, owing to the empowerment of the middle classes in emerging markets like China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new clients in the Crusaders.
Prestige Cruises requested that the US regulators go to the stock market in January 2014.
Apollo is the controlling shareholder at the company since $850 million in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise, in its current form in 2000, was created by a merger with a cruise owning Genting Bhd (GENT), a leisure and casino company under the control of Malaysia ’ s billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock market in January 2013.
Genting held 28% of the shares, Apollo 20% of the shares, and private equity company TPG Capital LP in late June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and Norwegian Cruise have 82% of passenger capacity at American cruises, according to the original petition documents for the stock market ’ s access for Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the vote.
A petty group flooded near China ’ s flag.
On Sunday, the National People ’ s Congress ’ s permanent committee passed a framework that allows only two or three candidates for Hong Kong ’ s leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee, which is likely to be staffed with peer members.
That decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to maintain their threat and slaughter Hong Kong's financial squad with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China ’ s leaders fear that calls for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China ’ s supremacy over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the election process in the Special Administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched in the city ’ s commercial district and organized a seat there.
Li ’ s interview is organized by the Hong Kong government and China ’ s Hong Kong Insurance Agency.
The deputy chairman of the permanent committee, Zhang Rongshun, and Vice Director of Hong Kong's Office for Affairs and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted over the day.
Student activists announced that on afternoon, they would gather before Hong Kong ’ s leadership office.
Britain did not envisage any democratic elements until the end of Hong Kong ’ s 150-year colonial government.
Putin wants Kiev to introduce "State Talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Sunday ’ s media reports, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations directly on the “statehood ” of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatists ’ territory of eastern Ukraine, which are controlled by the separatists, will be part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
But Putin ’ s call for the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russian insurgents fits with the strategy that it has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: assistance to separatists to seize territory and pressure Ukraine ’ s government to allow for the newly proclaimed Noossiya de facto independence for alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the state television channel, Putin condemned Ukraine ’ s military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the eastern Donetsk region that were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the territory taken as "Novorossija" or "Nurossiya," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glory days of Russia's empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who fought Ukraine's politicians for elections on the 80th century, while government groups in the areas held by separatists hope to be "trapped" in their illusions soon, "Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start promptly speedy talks not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeast Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin ’ s reference to statehood must be viewed in contexts with the greater autonomy discussed by Kiev ’ s leaders for months to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only Ukraine ’ s government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because Russia is not about conflict with Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spotlight on correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, which comprises the two million ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million Russians are not Russians, and pre-conflict polls won a wide majority of Ukraine ’ s stay.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats at international forums would give Ukraine ’ s regional governments full powers to negotiate their own trade and foreign relations, thereby giving the Kremlin de facto control over a territory that links Russia ’ s territory to Crimea.
Five months ago, the Black Sea peninsula is home to most of Russia ’ s navy, as well as a major trade port and historic coastal region.
Moreover, the regions between the Red Area of Russia and Crimea are rich in mines, factories, and vessels that create important components of Russia ’ s military.
Ukraine ’ s President Petro Poroshenko, speaking on June 7, proposed that Ukraine ’ s legislation, after new elections, consider amendments to the constitution in which each country would give greater control over its finances and language.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast with that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin ’ s last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders was followed by another round of rebel crackdowns last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Soviets Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup, which Ukrainian security officials fear was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, controlling Novosowk.
As a result, massive civilian and military preparations have been in place to consolidate a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants between Nowasowsk and narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU ’ s leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic independent of 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point at which there is no return," Warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine ’ s territory.
The EU summit did not decide concrete action, calling for further sanctions against Russia to take effect in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donbas region last week to support the beleaguered separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security Council, and Defense Reported in Kyiv on Saturday.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russia ’ s incursion into Ilowajk were replaced on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured by Ukrainian territory a week ago with Lysenko on Sunday.
Nacktfotoskal for Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten had no cry for his anger at hackers, who probably stolen neat images of his publishers Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of Hollywood ’ s A Promis.
The film town is in revolt after a series of clear photographs of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hackingscandal surrounding promis on the Internet.
The responsible hacker may have 60 nackpotos of Lawrence, Star of "the tribute of Panem," and of superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer in Rihanna, Ariana Grande, and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky, and Grecko of Melbourne reportedly also published private photographs on an iCloud void.
On the list are 101 celebrities.
"It is disgusting," Edelsts who spoke with Grecko last month told Confidential.
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "shameful," and that the sufferers felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer, with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two orders where she is in a pool without a pool.
Palmers's filmmakers include "love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovsky, and the actress Browning of Sucker Punch, were not available yesterday for comments on the peculiar images.
As one representative Lawrence told the TMZ, "It is a disgusting violation of privacy."
As actor Seth Rogen denounced the hacker in his tissue: "To poke images of a cell phone is no different from selling heaven."
In purely legal terms, the proliferation of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger, and Wanders were present at the 8th rampage on the Great Feldberg, supporting the club of "help for cancer children."
The tour for which one was a torture constitutes easy training for the others.
In one thing, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have done well last night.
For the first time in his life, yesterday ’ s chief of the Supreme House of Lords has fled the radar.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle ’ s daughter, given that participation in the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg in favor of the United States in "help for creative children" (Frankfurt) has personally brought him a valuable insight.
A tall order.
"I now know I can - prima!"
Small noise on the applause curve?
Nine, once I have been stopped, weary of ``weary'' from...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for CDU in the upper city parliament, many of the 718 participants yesterday turned to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to transcend the long mile between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dieschner, for example.
The wholly pro-Red Green Politicians from Kreistag - Red Bike - started with something else on the sidelines (each amount of professionals, because the target is!), but then halved on the mountain and passed through after 45 minutes with no respiratory.
He, too, is riddled through the specter in a rubble, as have Nina Kuhn, a city press secretary who had joined Frank in greeting.
For the two triathletes, the "field wheel" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, because we like to be at it - a process that we would have done today," Kuhn says.
They arrived at Paul Wenzel of Columenberg.
The boy (12) had sunk to the surface the morning, and had been streamlined again, on top of that.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swooped home on the morning at 9, "made the field two times," and then soared home.
enjoyable was also "Fritte Toni."
For the Chief Executive of the Cultural Culture, radar over the field is simply one of them.
He had rushed 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo-wheel race.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there, "Andreas Balzke said.
The penetrated Mainzer says that he is a "ambitious railer."
He must be this, for he was on the "fixi wheel" path, which is also a race but without division.
Not only did it prove that, even without Rad, it was a looser upward leap of the 20 wildlife that transcended the White Wall and the merger at the summit, but also a jogger who drew a weight-weighted car on a corpse.
Bergguard doctor Volker Lischke, who provided security to his team, equipped with Allrad Bully and Quad, said, "The know" of Frankfurt, who trains a special shot, only to keep the strings of himself. "So the man is his own song.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - had been put on the wayside on the morning in groups.
The migrants at first 9,30.
The first cyclists and retailers followed, following at 10.
Five minutes later, the first mountainer biased.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the United States's "radar" on the Great Feldberg, gave the star squad and wished a beautiful run for participants.
Next year, he hopes that he will succeed in blocking the specter of Feldberg into the security of participants.

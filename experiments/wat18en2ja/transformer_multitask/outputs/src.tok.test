<TR> As a result , useful knowledge on interrelation of structural activity was obtained . <TR>
<TR> This paper describes activation of congenital immunity induced by IL ‐ 12 and cell group concerned with it . <TR>
<TR> IL ‐ 12 is differentiation factor which shows the common activity for T cell group , which has a different positioning on the phylogeny . <TR>
<TR> It seems that action of urging rotation of sequence which has a connection with antigen peculia recognition by cancer peptides can be also expected . <TR>
<TR> Biological response of the resistance ( congenital immunity ) to cancer of IL ‐ 12 was also examined . <TR>
<TR> It has been verified so far that the ion range in the target could be controlled by the distance from the beam window to the target using the irradiation device for the cell which was coupled to beam line of the 3MV tandem accelerator . <TR>
<TR> The effect of the penetrating power controlled irradiation on tobacco pollen as a model cell system for the local irradiation was examined . " Pollen <TR>
<TR> with the leakage " which seemed to originate from the cell membrane damage was observed high ‐ frequently in the terminal of the ion range . <TR>
<TR> Pollen with the leakage can be observed when the heavy ion ‐ irradiated , dried pollen ( 20μm ) is dyed with acetocarmine , but it is not observed in the gamma ray ‐ irradiated pollen . <TR>
<TR> The effect of He and C ion at various distances from the beam window on the frequency of the pollen with the leakage was showed in the figure . <TR>
<TR> In the case of both ions , the frequency increased linearly with increase of ion ‐ fluence , and C ion ( LET800keV / μm in the cell surface ) was more effective than He ion ( the same 180keV / μm ) . <TR>
<TR> Effects of peristaltic flow in 3D TOF MRA angiography were examined by an experiment applying the phantom . <TR>
<TR> Signal strength in the fluid part ( especially , nearer part of inflow ) was low by the influence of a lowering of signal caused by phase dispersion in the peristaltic flow comparing with the steady flow . <TR>
<TR> Significant signal lowering by the peristaltic flow was observed in stenotic or flexal part of the vessels . <TR>
<TR> Ghost artifact by the peristaltic flow was shown , and the interval was proportional to the repeating time and pulse rate . <TR>
<TR> Geographical distribution and clinico ‐ epidemiological features of virus in the title ( C ) differ with genotypes . <TR>
<TR> Interferon sensitivity seems to be regulated by plural factors . <TR>
<TR> The degree of severity of hepatitis may differ with genotypes . <TR>
<TR> No significant correlation with primary hepatic cancer is observed . <TR>
<TR> Mutation of C is various except for genotypes , and it is possible for us to distinguish C strain for patients and examines the route of infection . <TR>
<TR> Nonlinear phenomena represented by chaos in fractal can probably quantified by numerical analysis . <TR>
<TR> A fractal analysis result of potentials related to events was applied to the survey of fluctuating conditions of intelligent activities . <TR>
<TR> The peak corresponding to N100 or P300 was not clear . <TR>
<TR> This is suggested that the fractal analysis is more suitable for detection of change in induction quantity than that of peaks . <TR>
<TR> It is paid attention to be a subject that a balance of the autonomic nervous function is spoiled by exposing the microgravity . <TR>
<TR> The sweating amount was measured continuously by the fixation of the probe in the flat side of the left pollex , using with head down tilt ( HDT ) lowering head to 6 degrees below the horizon as a simulation of the microgravity . <TR>
<TR> The sweating amount by the handgrip ( for 5 seconds at the largest grasping power ) in HDT significantly lowered in the time without the back oppression in the sitting position , but the difference could not be recognized in the mental calculation load . <TR>
<TR> It is indicated that the sweating in HDT makes a difference between psychogenic load and exercising load . <TR>
<TR> In normal cells , telomere is shortened every time when cells are devided and cells grow old when some altimate value is exceeded . <TR>
<TR> On the contray , in tumor cells and immortalized cells , telomere is complemented as they have telomerase activity , constant length is kept without further shortening , and unlimited multiplication ability is acquired . <TR>
<TR> Therefore , the gene which controls telomerase activity is regarded as one candidacy for the cellular aging induction gene . <TR>
<TR> The possibility that unknown telomerase controlling gene existed on 3 chromosome 3p14 → p21 was suggested . <TR>
<TR> The following was fabricated experimentally : Active electrode with transmitting function to lead through surface myogenic potential without pretreatment or without using conductive paste , of skin . <TR>
<TR> Burden for a tester could be reduced , because this cordless electrode had no lead wire to connect an electrode with a transmitter different from the conventional telemetry system . <TR>
<TR> The electrode did not receive influence of noise caused by reciprocation of a lead wire . <TR>
<TR> It can be applied to electrocardiograms and brain wave measurements , etc . , and simplification of measurements can be expected . <TR>
<TR> Telomerase activity is high in reproductive cells and cancer cells . <TR>
<TR> Using the elongation PCR assay which authors developed , the telomerase activity of normal and canceration blood cells was analyzed . <TR>
<TR> Activity was high in cells of the young , especially newborn infant , and was very slight in cells of 30 ‐ year ‐ old or more . <TR>
<TR> In leukemia cells , it was very high . <TR>
<TR> Based on the studies of Marcel T and Grausz D , the present condition of the gene therapy was introduced . <TR>
<TR> Since the gene therapy was applied for the first time to the human in 1990 , the number of subjects has rapidly increased year by year . <TR>
<TR> The indication that had been limited for intractable diseases only has gradually been expanded for chronic diseases , as the safety is confirmed . <TR>
<TR> This paper introduced 3 different directions of recent gene therapy ‐ development of gene transduction , studies of the strategy , and model development . <TR>
<TR> This paper reports the administration of the above drug ( L ) in a 41 ‐ year ‐ old female who received steroid therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus . <TR>
<TR> She had the subjective symptoms of coolness and pain in the right lower leg , and developed ulcers with necrotic tissues on the right anterior shin bone , which were gradually exacerbated . <TR>
<TR> Administering L at 10μg / day for 4 weeks through drip infusion , together with wound treatments including the cleaning of the ulcers , reduced the pain and the ulcers on the lower leg . <TR>
<TR> No side effect was noted during treatment . <TR>
<TR> CGRP is secreted from the sensory nerve region to the heart muscle . <TR>
<TR> The 48 ‐ hour administration of CGRP increased the surface area of new born rat myocardial cells by about 2 times . <TR>
<TR> Nore over , CGRP up ‐ regulates mRNA expression for skeletal muscle α actin and atrial natriuresis peptide . <TR>
<TR> The results indicate that CGRP may be a potent hypertrophic factor for myocardial cells . <TR>
<TR> In order to obtain the data , that the artificial leg foot may be able to adapt also for the walking mode except for the flatland , the walking conditions for flatland and slope way were measured . <TR>
<TR> The following were collected : Bending moment and subjective evaluation required by the semiconductor strain gauge stuck in the lower leg pipe division . <TR>
<TR> In the slope ways , whose inclination angles were 5 and 7 degrees respectively , the measurements were similarly performed on the case in which angles of the base dorsiflexion were adjusted to those of the slope way , or on the case in which these angles were not adjusted . <TR>
<TR> The walking was the easiest , when plantar flexion and dorsiflexion changed by adjusting to the angle in the slope way . <TR>
<TR> A method is developed which applies the knowledge of the form and movement about the image information and measurement objects and measures motion without setting gauge marks . <TR>
<TR> The photographs of a walking horse are taken from the side and the dimensions and positions of the geometric model are obtained from an image out of the photographs by hand method . <TR>
<TR> The luminance distribution in the geometric model area is taken and a template is made . <TR>
<TR> In the following images , the geometric models are superposed on the images at every segment , and the position and angle the joint of the horse are determined . <TR>
<TR> The speeding up , robustness evaluation , and accuracy of the process are described . <TR>
<TR> Emotional sweating quantity and heart rate when a preparation of a program as a mental stimulation was given , were simultaneously measured to investigate their correlation . <TR>
<TR> Considerable correlativity between normalization dispersion value of emotional sweating quantity and dispersion of heart rate in giving 2 kinds of prepared programs was confirmed . <TR>
<TR> At the same time , in giving prepared programs , there was a case where high corelativity between normalization dispersion value of emotional sweating quantity and dispersion of heart rate was confirmed and a case where that between them were hardly confirmed . <TR>
<TR> Further experiment was considered to be necessary . <TR>
<TR> The complicated interaction between the immune system and PCV2 of pigs was outlined . <TR>
<TR> The evidence that PCV2 is a main pathogen in pigs in the adequate environment or the management condition was introduced . <TR>
<TR> The extensive stimulation of the immune system is an essential condition for induction of the pig multiorgan-underdeveloped after weaning syndrome ( PMWS ) in the PCV2-infected pigs . <TR>
<TR> And PCV2 itself is an indispensable pathogen for lethal PMWS . <TR>
<TR> In the PMWS-contracted pigs , the effective immunological response to the pathogens except for PCV2 is insufficient . <TR>
<TR> Based on the clinic , pathological , and immunological observations in the fields regarding the immunosuppressive condition in PMWS , PCV2 may be the important factor for the immunodeficiency which secondarily occurrs in some constant environments . <TR>
<TR> The collection survey was performed on the reef coasts of the northern region of Ibaraki Prefecture . <TR>
<TR> The large-type species were directly collected , but the smaller species were collected by sieving out the hand nets or the bed soils . <TR>
<TR> Among the small-type Crustacea , Paracanthomysis hispida of Mysidae , and Caprella japonica and C. tsugarensis of Caprellidae were confirmed for the first time in Ibaraki Prefecture . <TR>
<TR> The large-type Crustacea obtained were : 2 species of 2 families in Pedunculata , 3 species of 3 families in Sessilia , and 10 species of 5 families in Decapoda . <TR>
<TR> A few species were obtained , since the survey was limited to the intertidal zone . <TR>
<TR> Including the survey result so far obtained , the species collected , the collection sites , and the collection dates were arranged and shown . <TR>
<TR> In order to study methods for evaluating the degree of vitalization in agricultural village region , a field survey was conducted with five regions deemed to be highly vitalized . <TR>
<TR> A regional activation process was collated as a flow of " input " - > " activity " - > " result " - > " achievement " to study whether activities for diverse regional developments and vitalizations were working together for cooperation . <TR>
<TR> In addition , the extraction of a system that activated regions and process and system analyses of regional activation process were used to prepare a check sheet for sustainable regional activation . <TR>
<TR> For an analysis using statistics by village , items showing activation status were tabulated to show they were related to factors showing the level of village activation . <TR>
<TR> A questionnaire analysis showed a gap between an activation level directly calculated from satistical indicies and an overall evaluation . <TR>
<TR> A covariance structure analysis showed that the direct effects ( production activation effects ) of social capital was high in regions other than cities and suburbs . <TR>
<TR> The paper outlines resource management efforts of the past year on swordfish in the Northwest Atlantic region . <TR>
<TR> The worldwide catch of swordfish in the past five years ranged from 9,552 tons to 12,283 tons . <TR>
<TR> The stock index estimated from data on trawl fishing conducted in each member country of ICCAT was used in resource assessment for the year 2002 through VPA and non-equilibrium production model . <TR>
<TR> The results of the assessment showed smooth recovery of the stock size since 1997 helped by abundant new recruitment . <TR>
<TR> ICCAT is developing a plan that can put back the stock to the MSY level with 50 % probability by 2009 . <TR>
<TR> Restricting TAC for the coming years , banning catch of smaller fish , and sharply reducing by-catch were measures adopted by ICCAT . <TR>
<TR> The paper outlines health of sea turtles as a species and their biological characteristics . <TR>
<TR> The Appendix I of Washington Treat lists all the species of sea turtles . <TR>

<TR> This paper presents outlines of the study and the results obtained for economic and social conditions for water conserving hydrologically sound agriculture to exist . <TR>
<TR> For keeping the quality of cut flower of rose , the authors developed a new drug prescription ( GLCA ) using an isothiazoline system antibacterial agent . <TR>
<TR> As the isothiazoline system antibacterial agent , they used liquid mixture CMI / MI , which is made of of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-on and 2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-on . <TR>
<TR> As a result , the following mixing ratio was the optimum for GLCA : 10 g / l of glucose , 0.5 ml / l of isothiazoline system antibacterial agent , 30 mg / l of citric acid , and 50 mg / l of aluminium sulfate . <TR>
<TR> On the basis of this prescription , moisture permeation was kept at the level right after harvest , and quality preservation period was extended further than the conventional prescription . <TR>
<TR> To study the stability of genes introduced into recombinant crops , three kinds of tests were performed for proteome analysis and metabolome analysis . <TR>
<TR> First , a microarray analysis with germinating soybeans was performed to examine qualitative variance in RNA expression , which is a hindrance to transcriptome analysis , the first step of the aforementioned analyses . <TR>
<TR> The result showed that local varieties varied in RNA expression by individual and extraction method . <TR>
<TR> A multiple-specimen crusher for RNA extraction permitted a low-csot and simple treatment of specimens . <TR>
<TR> This method was used to confirm that RNA expression varied amoung individuals of an imported recombinant variety . <TR>
<TR> Yoso cable stayed bridge of 145m span length and effective width 5m which and large section laminated wood was constructed in Hiroshima Prefecture Central Forest Park . <TR>
<TR> It was built with a large span joint of more than 2 members . <TR>
<TR> The construction was more complicated than simple girder bridge because of combinating various members including connecters . <TR>
<TR> Creosote oil is inserted under pressure as corrosion prevention measure , and all junctions of truss member were bolt ‐ jointed . <TR>

<TR> Present states of agriculture and forestry of Azuma village were analyzed to understand their problems and issues . <TR>
<TR> Conditions provided as goods are described . <TR>
<TR> Cooperation between an agricultural cooperative and a persimmon producers ' cooperative , and direct sales and " U ‐ pack " mail are proposed as an improvement measures for the sales system and sales methods respectively . <TR>
<TR> As for persimmon village planning yield prediction and processable quantity are examioned and states and scales of harvest collection / selection fields , drying / fumigation chambers , store ‐ houses , etc. are presented as necessary facilities . <TR>
<TR> Cultural facilities and composite industries such as sale of local foods and specialties are proposed to attract tourists who are just passing by . <TR>
<TR> This report is the research result conducted for Daisen Town by Corporation for Zenkoku Nogyo Kozo Kaizen Kyokai based on the subject set up by National Land Agency . <TR>
<TR> Results of the third mountain village promotion business of Daisen Town is nearly the same as the initial plan except for the field improvement . <TR>
<TR> On the improvement of living environments , improvement state and directions of facilities were described such as dwelling houses , roads , and traffic . <TR>
<TR> Present states of production and sales of agriculture and forestry were clarified , and promotion of local industries and development of special products were described . <TR>
<TR> As promotion measures against mountain villages related to sightseeing and resort development , the following were mentioned such as development of agriculture and forestry for sightseeing , production of special products , links between sales and city residents , development as health and pleasure resort places , and improvement . <TR>
<TR> Future issues are indicated such as creation of business opportunities concerning mountain village promotion , and establishment of the sectors in charge of upbringing of new industries and various business . <TR>
<TR> Soil productivity fluctuation and soil productivity improvement countermeasure by andosol plowed field improvement material were examined concerning the described title . <TR>
<TR> In cabbage , increased productivity effect was recognized by organic fertilization , and utilization factor of charge nitrogen decreased in an organic fertilization zone , but utilization factors of nitrogen , phosphoric acid , potassium of compost was different by a type of the manure . <TR>
<TR> It is considered that andosol soil has higher nitrogen supply force than that of yellow soil . <TR>
<TR> Zinc was a little higher in a pig excrement stable manure zone concerning heavy metal content rate of cabbage . <TR>
<TR> Investigations were made in to the effects on dry material intake and growth speed by mixed feed supply during nurture or breeding periods . <TR>
<TR> As for feed intake , delays of morning grasses were appeared by selected eating of artificial milk during upbringing periods in mixed intake areas . <TR>
<TR> Feed intake exceeded in the mixed area after the middle breeding eriods , and body weights of eighteen month ‐ ages became 477 ± 28 kg in the mixed areas and 451 ± 14 kg in the separate areas . <TR>
<TR> Differences in the first gastic juice , and blood characteristics and reproductive ability were not recognized . <TR>
<TR> The environmental pollution by waste of overpackaging causes a serious problem . <TR>
<TR> As one of its countermeasures , the development of biodegradable plastic for container and packaging material is studied . <TR>
<TR> This paper presents present state and prospect of the development of biodegradable plastic made from such materials as petroleum or natural macromolecule chemical compound . <TR>
<TR> As representative examples that are placed on the market in Japan at present , this paper introduces the following : Biopole , Bionole , Ractie , Ecomatie AX and Potetoray . <TR>
<TR> It also describes utilization of biodegradable plastic in food packaging and related laws and regulations , and safety of products after the decomposition . <TR>
<TR> The elucidation of growth characteristics and suitable tree figure under warm pluvial condition were carried out and the suitable growth standards of variety " Gyokuei " were set . <TR>
<TR> The effect of early leaf abscission on the flower bud character and the relation between the growth characteristics and the yield of high production tree were examined . <TR>
<TR> The application of plant growth regulators is examined as a technique to induce suitable growth and maturation pattern . <TR>
<TR> The applicationo f regulators such as PP ‐ 333 , S ‐ 327D , improved C ‐ MH and KUH ‐ 833 is possible for the purpose of the prevention of current shoot spindly growth . <TR>
<TR> The described variety of the paddy rice has good quality and good eating quality , and in Miyagi Prefecture , it is a strain of " late " of the late ‐ season breed . <TR>
<TR> In the same prefecture , it will be adopted as a recommended variety in place of a part of " Sasanishiki " , for the purpose of cool damage prevention by the dispersion of the heading time and dispersion in the cutting time . <TR>
<TR> Though the probability that the variety encounters low temperature in boot stage lowers for the late ‐ season breed , it is necessary to try heat insulation of young spike by deep water control , when low temperature is anticipated in dangerous stage , because the cold resistance is weak . <TR>
<TR> The blast disease field resistance is moderate in the case of rice leaves blight . <TR>
<TR> Shimajiri group mudstone in Okinawa is classified into Neogene mudstone . <TR>
<TR> In mudstone region , S S concentrations of more than 10,000 mg / L were frequently detected in turbid water discharged from development project sites . <TR>
<TR> By comparing SS concentrations in turbine water discharged from land improvement sites , it is evaluated that the runoff from mudstone is approximately eight times as much as that from Kunigami Mergel . <TR>
<TR> In the case of cutting sites , the principal factor of runoff mechanism is a slaking , and water erosion and collapse can also be observed in creaked portion . <TR>
<TR> In the case of banking sites , the growth of large gully by water erosion was observed . <TR>
<TR> Soil hardness directly or indirectly affects the growth of plant roots . <TR>
<TR> So far , the relation between the extension of roots and soil hardness was evaluated by measuring soil hardness indirectly . <TR>
<TR> Then , with a pin penetrometer manufactured by simulating a root affected by soil hardness when penetrating soil , this paper measures soil hardness and experiments the penetration of roots . <TR>
<TR> As the result , the soil hardness with the pin penetrometer made possible the measurement of the penetration of roots , however , it was suggested that the penetration of roots was affected not only by soil hardness , but by soil pore . <TR>
<TR> From the manuring irrigation experimental result , total population of large soil animals inpasture where slurry is scattered is less than that in chemical fertilizer zone , but it increased in the fourth year . <TR>
<TR> The following could not be sampled in the fourth year : Acarine , Collembola . <TR>
<TR> Nematodes decreased in the chemical fertilizer zone in the fourth year , and t proportion of animals to eat root increased even in either zone and it is considered that this dues to growth development of grass root group . <TR>
<TR> Concerning soil microflora , in the slurry sprayed zone , bacteria & actinomyces are more and cellulose decompositin rate and mold number are less , than those of the chemical fertilizer zone . <TR>
<TR> A rideable rice transplanter capable of laying lightweight paper mulch on paddy field and transplanting seedlings with working capacity of 14a / h was intended to develope . <TR>
<TR> Setting of development specification and investigation for narrowing the system to be realized ( one person rideable , seedling injury protecting , mulch laying on paddy field , self decay time of mulch , etc . ) were made . <TR>
<TR> Using three kinds of experimentally made mulching paper of different strength , transplanting test was made with a commercial mulch rice transplanter to investigate working properties , planting accuracy , etc. preliminarily in order to select the paper to be used . <TR>
<TR> The results and outline of the mulch paper selected andthe development and experimental manufacture of the rice transplanter are included . <TR>
<TR> This paper presents " Individualization corner " of the titled vegetable handling wholesaler . <TR>
<TR> The backgrounds of establishment of the titled " Individual horticultural products section " , such as the production and consumption of safe and health-conscious , and search of agricultural products buried in mass distribution , are described . <TR>
<TR> The details in the establishment of " Individual horticultural products section " such as progress and approach are explained . <TR>
<TR> Search of new handling products and future direction are explained . <TR>
<TR> In the breeding farmhouse of Japanese black of 160 heads , 14 heads contracted disease in 26 〜 33 months age , and 2 heads died and 4 heads were shipped at early stage . <TR>
<TR> As the result of testing the died cattle 1 head and the shipped cattle 1 head and carrying out pathological and bacteriolgic inspection , they were diagnosed as the titled disease . <TR>
<TR> Coccidia oocyst was detected from 8 heads by examination of feces of 9 heads . <TR>
<TR> It is considered that mucosa was damaged by the parasitism of Coccidia and they died , as the environment suitable for growth and breeding of Clostridium perfuringens was prepared and aberrant growth was caused , and shipped cattle contracted necrotizing enteritis . <TR>
<TR> The genealogy , in which there is the family history suffering the frequently occurring diabetes due to autosomal dominant inheritance over 3 successive generations with the crisis age of 25 years or less in age , is named MODY ( M ) . <TR>
<TR> The classification by the causative genes for this M ( M1-M5 ) , the direct sequence method as an identification method for the M causative genes , and the utilization of DHPLC were explained . <TR>
<TR> The M gene is an abnormal form of the gene normally functioning in the pancreas β-cells , characteristically leading to the hyposecretion of insulin . <TR>
<TR> However , the abnormality of the M gene has been so far discovered in about 20 % of the M , while the remainder are unknown . <TR>
<TR> In 20 asymptomatic cerebral infarction patients , 10 normal persons , and 21 infant cases without neurological abnormality in fiscal 2000 , the perivascular space ( PVS ) of the cerebral hemisphere white matter artery ( medullary artery ) was depicted by a high-magnetic field MRI ( 1.5 T ) . <TR>
<TR> The PVS depiction exhibited the findings that ( 1 ) fundamentally the limbus was in order , ( 2 ) the boundary was clear without changes in the circumference , and ( 3 ) the maximum diameter was 3 mm or less , lying along the artery in the cerebral parenchyma . <TR>
<TR> The PVS has been expanded with aging . <TR>
<TR> In multiple lacunar infarction cases , the PVS of the medullary artery has been expanded obviously . <TR>
<TR> In the cases with hypertension , the expansion was further strengthened . <TR>
<TR> These findings indicated that the PVS of the medullary artery was further expanded in the course of progress of the medullary arteriosclerosis . <TR>
<TR> In artificial mortar re-replacement therapy , the defective part of acetabular cartridge bone is reconstructed by the homogeneous bone transplantation , and cementless socket is installed directly . <TR>
<TR> In the postoperative , there was the transfer of the socket by collapse of the grafted bone . <TR>
<TR> In the operation after 1984 , for the collapse prevention , support-ring has been used jointly . <TR>
<TR> In this paper , the postoperative result was examined for 42 cases of 45 joints ( man 12 / woman 30,40 〜 82-year-old ) by the re-replacement therapy in the roentgenology . <TR>
<TR> In the case which transplanted the homogeneous bone in the load division , the fixation was got by using strut-screw jointly at support-ring , initial stage firm . <TR>
<TR> The component was stabilized for the position installed , when the grafted bone is implanted , and when remodeling is completed . <TR>
<TR> Using octacalcium phosphate ( OCP ) , which is also the precursor of apatite in the organism as a paste , the fusion into dentine by the irradiation of the carbon dioxide laser was tested . <TR>
<TR> The paste whose raw materials were diphosphoric acid calcium dihydrate and calcium carbonate melted with dentine by irradiation of the carbon dioxide laser and shut a part of the dentinal tubule . <TR>
<TR> The OCP paste fused on the dentine surface and specifically around the dentinal tubule , as well as shut the dentinal tubule . <TR>
<TR> Because the fusion layer was formed in the dentine by the calcium phosphate salt coating in the case of irradiation of the carbon dioxide laser , the possibility of dentine hyperesthesia and strengthening of the dentine plane after caries treatment was suggested . <TR>
<TR> The congenital vascular anomaly theory has been so far proposed concerning Budd-Chiari syndrome ( BCS ) . <TR>
<TR> But because the membranous structure , and stenosis and blockade of the origin part of the hepatic vein can be explained recently by the thrombus and its organization , it has been considered that the acquired thrombus theory is its cause . <TR>
<TR> In this study the following was examined : The gene polymorphism of codons 830 and 897 of factor V in Japanese BCS cases in the sample preservation center and Nepal BCS cases . <TR>
<TR> As the result , the gene polymorphism of factor V was found at 6 sites , and codons 830 and 897 among them were missense mutants . <TR>
<TR> For 31 cases , with 58 lesions , for which hepatic tumor was indicated by other test , diffusion weighted image ( DWI ) as the latest MRI imaging was performed . <TR>
<TR> The depiction by DWI was difficult for 10 lesions including 4 lesions with tumor size of less than 5 mm , 3 lesions of around 1 cm , and 3 lesions of around 2 cm . <TR>
<TR> The cases in which depicting at a size over 1 cm was not possible were the case which was placed close to the diaphragm , or the case after the treatment of primary hepatic cancer . <TR>

<TR> A non-specific reaction is rarely experienced in routine test , and it never ocuurs to investigate it to the cause retrieval and improve the reagent . <TR>
<TR> Recently , we have examined the cause of non-specific reaction in the measurement of HBs antigen ( Ag ) and HBe antigen in hematologic disease , and experienced an improvement of reagent . <TR>
<TR> From June , 1997 , the measurement of HBs antigen , antibody ( Ab ) , HBe antigen , antibody and HCV antibody by ELSIA-F750 automatic immunity measuring device on the principle of ELISA ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) was started . <TR>
<TR> The case was in a patient of untreated acute myeloid leukemia , who was hospitalized for the purpose of bone marrow transplantation , wrongly diagnosed by the non-specific reaction of HBsAg and HBeAg reagent in the infection test , and reported as suspected of initial stage of hepatitis B infection . <TR>
<TR> For the purpose of confirmation of whether the unspecific substance has already combined in the primary reaction from measurement process and each reagent composition and checking of the difference in each item according to the reagent composition , each item was measured by an exclusive measurement container of F-750 to which antibody protein has not combined . <TR>
<TR> As a result of the examination , the avoidance of the non-specific reaction was possible by an addition of 1 % casein solution to the HBsAg , HBeAg buffer solution , or a change of the blocking agent . <TR>
<TR> Recently , non-alcoholic fatty hepatic disorder ( NAFLD ) has increased rapidly by the change of the lifestyle habit . <TR>

<TR> The virus inspection and immunoserologic inspection of BALF and blood plasma were carried out for 14 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) patients and of 8 patients hospitalized for IPF acute aggravation . <TR>
<TR> The cytokine which significantly increased in BALF in the acute aggravation stage compared with the IPF stable stage was high in 13 types out of 17 type measured , and especially IL-6 , TNFα and IFNγ tended to be high in the poor prognosis cases . <TR>
<TR> In 3 cases of BALF reexamination during the acute aggravation treating process , IL-2 , IL-5 and IL-6 showed decreasing tendencies by the treatment regardless of prognosis , and IL-8 , IFNγ and TNFα showed the upward tendencies in the poor prognosis cases . <TR>
<TR> In the blood plasma , IL-6 , IL-7 , IL-8 and IL-10 significantly increased in the acute aggravation stage compared with the stable stage . <TR>
<TR> The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation . <TR>
<TR> In airway inflammation , various cells such as eosinophils , T-cells , mast cells , neutrophils , macrophages and airway epithelium , and various liquid factors are involved . <TR>
<TR> It is taken seriously that Th2 cytokine is involved not only in central airway , but also in peripheral airway , in the position of airway inflammation . <TR>
<TR> In addition , the disease states of airway remodeling such as the peeling of tracheal epithelial cell and turning into embryonic cell , basal membrane thickening , hypertrophy and hyperplasia of tracheal smooth muscle , and angiogenesis are clarified , which bring about irreversible airway closure and chronically intensify airway anaphylaxia to cause the asthma to become serious and intractable . <TR>
<TR> For the treatment of asthma , it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs , mainly inhalation steroids , from the early stage , for the suppression of the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation . <TR>
<TR> The features of bronchial asthma are repeated paroxysmal stridor , dyspnea and cough , which tend to appear at night and in early morning , and in the auscultation finding , the sound is continuous A , especially harmonic flute-like sound . <TR>
<TR> In addition , objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma . <TR>
<TR> It is evaluated by spirometry or peak flow meter , and airway hypersensitivity test is performed . <TR>
<TR> The evaluation of airway inflammation is performed by sputum test , measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration , expiration condensate measurement , and allergological examination . <TR>
<TR> The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation . <TR>
<TR> What are important in the clinical diagnosis are , 1 ) that a symptom which derives from air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly , 2 ) that reversibility is shown , at least partially , in the air flow restriction , and 3 ) that other diseases are excluded . <TR>
<TR> As a result of our genetic analysis , the possibility that IL-17F gene fulfills an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed . <TR>
<TR> PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of airway remodeling , and the functional polymorphism of PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether airway remodeling easily progresses or not . <TR>
<TR> CCL5 is a chemokine induced strongly from airway epithelium in viral infection , and especially , it may fulfil an important role for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma . <TR>
<TR> When the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor , it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy . <TR>
<TR> From the above , the understanding of the disease was deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level . <TR>
<TR> By making these pathways to be a target , it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma . <TR>
<TR> We outlined the electrocardiogram synchronous reconstitution CT angiography ( 4 D-CTA ) developed in order to understand the dynamic status of cerebral aneurysm wall correctly . <TR>

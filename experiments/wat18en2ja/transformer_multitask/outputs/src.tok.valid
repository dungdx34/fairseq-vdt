<TR> Since it was known that this species had the habit of foraging for a prey mainly in the furrow of the paddy field and in the slope of the furrow , it was considered that this species might not live in Asakawa with a few paddy field environments . <TR>
<TR> When near infrared light was applied to biometrical measurements , good biotissue permeability was shown . <TR>
<TR> Especially , the wavelength range from 700nm to 1300nm is used in this . <TR>
<TR> Light ray will not penetrate a biotissue by scattering of the tissue when the wave length is shorter than this range , and if the wave length is longer than this range , then the light ray as well as not penetrate by water absorption . <TR>
<TR> On hemoglobin in the blood , myoglobin in muscle and cytochrome oxidaze in mitochondrion , the bioabsorption spectrum for ray of light in those wave ranges depend on their oxgen combination condition . <TR>
<TR> In this paper , a method for measuring , the oxygen state of in vivo himoglobin ( mainly in a brain ) for a noninvasion state was principally shown from measurement principles to clinical applications . <TR>

<TR> Gene ( G ) encoding a precursor was cloned . <TR>
<TR> As a result of base sequences , G encoded protein with a molecular weight of 24,267 Da consisting of 239 amino acid , and this protein was clarified to be a phosphatidylinositol anchor . <TR>
<TR> Both of hepatocyte growth factor ( SF / HGF ) and epithelial cell growth factor ( EGF ) showed production of inositol 3 ‐ phosphate acid production and evaluation of intracellular Ca2 + rise of concentration . <TR>
<TR> Both factors show possibility of additive action because of different mode of action . <TR>
<TR> Pertussis toxin blocked cellular signal transduction of both factors and inhibited action of hepatocytes proliferation . <TR>
<TR> It is considered that cellular signal transduction is controlled by G protein or analogues . <TR>
<TR> MRSA strain N315 has a regulator gene mecl in the upstream of a methicillin ‐ resistant gene mecA and is sensitive to methicillin . <TR>
<TR> Manifestation mechanisms of drug resistance are examined by knockout of the mecl gene . <TR>
<TR> Expression of mecA needed destruction of the mecl gene . <TR>
<TR> It is considered that destruction of the mecl gene caused moderate methicillin resistance with a heteroresistance pattern and caused acquisition of high resistance by adding unknown changes . <TR>
<TR> Micromachine techniques are being applied to microobjects such as DNA and cells in medical and biological engineering . <TR>
<TR> However , few research reports have been published concerning force sensing and control of cells microgripper . <TR>
<TR> An applying method of mirogripper to force sensing is described by measuring stress charged on a microstructure with laser Raman spectroscopy . <TR>

<TR> Property , distribution , expression through aging , gene of submandibular grand androgen receptor ( I ) and the relations with a heat shock protein , HSP90 were outlined . <TR>
<TR> I exists as a high molecule of about 220kDa molecular weight , and it is activated by depolymerization . <TR>
<TR> Number of male rat I binding sites under 1 / 2 the number of female , and its was imilar even in the thymus gland , accessory lacrimal gland , and kidney . <TR>
<TR> The androgen controls negatively ImRNA . <TR>
<TR> It was indicated that the binding of HSP90 to I contributed to the stabilization of higher ‐ order structure of I . <TR>
<TR> We tried generation of salicin from salicyl alcohol using callus induced from coffee and Lochnera rosea containing glucosyltransferase , because glucoside generation using plant suspension culture cell is more efficient than chemical glycosylation method . <TR>
<TR> The growth rate of the callus of the coffee was faster than that of the Lochnera rosea , and from the growth curve of the suspension culture cell , we judged that 1 〜 5 day was induction period , 6 〜 20 day was logarithmic growth period and on and after 21 day stationary period . <TR>
<TR> From the chart of high performance liquid chromatography , retention time of the salicin which is glycoside was 5.86 and identified with that of the standard sample . <TR>
<TR> The maximum of the glycoside production was anyway in the case of cultivation at 1mM concentration through a day , and its production tended to decrease with increase of time and concentration . <TR>
<TR> Sweating amount was examined with continuous recording in giving the calculation problem in elementary school sixth grade and junior high school third grade . <TR>
<TR> The local sweating amount was measured with adhering the probe to the pollex abdomen region of the opposite to the dominated hand . <TR>
<TR> It is showed that the reproducibility of psychogenic sweating amount in the answering calculation problem is high , and that NVH is useful as the index which quantitatively evaluates the psychogical load , because the value of " fluctuation ( NVH ) " changes in proportion to the difficulty of the problem . <TR>
<TR> The psychological load estimation model was proposed . <TR>
<TR> Enzymochemical and immunochemical measurement techniques can measure biochemicals more quickly and easily with higher sensitivity than conventional chemical and biological measurement techniques , and they have become applied to the measurement related to foods , environmental substances , and agricultural chemicals . <TR>
<TR> Future issues include the noninvassive measurement in the medical field and the non ‐ destructive inspection in the food industry . <TR>
<TR> It is necessary to develop the analytical technique not using blood collection as soon as possible for the measurement that has to be done every day , such as the glucose level in diabetic examination . <TR>
<TR> The development of easy semi ‐ quantitative analytical kits is one of the most important issues in future for comfortable health ‐ oriented lifestyle . <TR>
<TR> In this study , the above drug ( I ) and lenograstim were administered alternately to 2 , 61 ‐ year ‐ old female patients with gynecologic cancer in the leucopenic stage by chemotherapy to comparatively examine their utilities . <TR>
<TR> Leucocyte recovery was greater and quicker when I was administered . <TR>
<TR> Peripheral blood G ‐ CSF receptor positive rate was higher when I was administered , suggesting that more neutrophils were mobilized by G ‐ CSF when I was administered . <TR>
<TR> These results suggest that I may reduce the total amount of G ‐ CSF and thereby reduce the economical burden of the patient . <TR>
<TR> This paper outlined bioactivation of insulin ‐ like growth factors ( IGFs ) property of the acceptor , and intracellular information transfer ( A ) route . <TR>
<TR> The bioactivation of IGFs in vitro and in vivo was displayed . <TR>

<TR> This paper also mentioned A mechanism specific to long term IGFs response , and the interation with another transmission route . <TR>
<TR> The above examination was performed after 9 ‐ day culture using a rat metanephros culture system . <TR>
<TR> The differentiation of podocyte was observed with an electron microscope , and callosity formation was confirmed . <TR>
<TR> It was found that the podocyte showed its form and functional differentiation without vascular invasion . <TR>
<TR> The examination of podocyte specific markers showed that , like in vivo cell differentiation , the differentiation characteristics of the podocyte depend on the glomerular morphology during developmental process both morphologically and functionally . <TR>
<TR> It became clear that the period for phenotypic expression was equal between in vivo and in vitro . <TR>
<TR> Factor D emittedin a culture solution of gastric cancer derived culture cell was measured by micro factor D quantitative method using a recently developed sandwich ELIS . <TR>
<TR> All of four kinds of the gastric cancer derived culture cells produced the factor D in vitro . <TR>
<TR> The detected factor D was not mere exudation nor leakage , but a protein synthesized by the cell . <TR>
<TR> The epithelial cell of the stomach produced and secreted the factor D in a physiological state and it was clarified for the first time that the epithelium cell was one of the factor D producive cell . <TR>
<TR> Cytokine adjusts various cell responses , and simultaneously forms very complicated networks , and fulfills a function as an information transfer material between cells . <TR>
<TR> The disease state is delayed and deteriorated without converging in the direction of recovery when the delicate cytokine network fails by the surplus or shortage of a part of cytokine . <TR>
<TR> This is not an exception even in cytokine administration throughout the long term for therapeutic purpose . <TR>
<TR> From above facts , it is considered that examination on clinical utilization of the cytokine from the new viewpont based on the storage of knowledge on functions and dynamic states of production cells and response cells in the phase would be necessary in future . <TR>
<TR> Due to fungi management demands to processed foods , diversification of consumer preference , health orientations , etc. the products to be sterilized are diversifing recently . <TR>
<TR> It is similar situation in the sterilization of liquids . <TR>

<TR> The article describes the outline of sterilizer as a crucial part of liquid pasteurization system , and introduces an example of optimum system proposal . <TR>
<TR> The pigs that show shivering , dyspnea , skin flush , and hyperthermia under extremely excited state are called the pigs sensitive to pig stress syndrome ( PSS ) . <TR>
<TR> PSS and malignant hyperpyrexia syndrome are induced by short-time exposure to halothane gas , and the detection test using halothane has become an important means to elucidate PSS inheritance . <TR>
<TR> It has been proven that pale soft exudative pork ( PSE ) is also closely related to PSS . <TR>
<TR> Although the deterioration of meat qualities is originated from the muscular acidification due to postmortem changes , it also depends on genetic factors such as the degradation of myofibril and perimysium protein . <TR>
<TR> Except for genetic factors , the conditions of slaughter and experience of pigs during rearing period also affect meat qualities . <TR>
<TR> Breed difference was recognized on stress due to contact with human and reaction for slaughter conditions , and it was proven that the effects of stress reaction on meat qualities are variety dependence . <TR>
<TR> In order to control harmful insects of Heptophylla picea damaging the sprouts of Thea sinensis , the installation time of the pheromone trap and the time of the larval occurrence were examined . <TR>
<TR> The following were mentioned : The distribution situation of the harmful insects in the south of Kyoto Prefecture , the occurrence fluctuation of the male imagoes by the pheromone trap , and the investigation of the larval digging and taking in the autumn . <TR>
<TR> The inhabitation of Heptophylla picea is limited to Wazuka Town in the south of Kyoto Prefecture ; <TR>
<TR> in 2003 it was first caught by the trap on June 11 and last caught on July 14 . The imagoes of Heptophylla picea was limited to the 4th to 5th weeks of June . <TR>
<TR> On the effect of the yellow high-pressure sodium lamp which is friendly to the cultivation environment of Thea sinensis , the case investigation in Kyoto Prefecture was carried out . <TR>
<TR> The pheromone trap was installed in the tea garden , and the numbers of tea leaf rollers and smaller tea tortrixes attracted and killed were compared every day . <TR>
<TR> The installation was done between April 6 and October 12 , and the pheromone drug was exchanged about once a month . <TR>
<TR> The yellow high-pressure sodium lamp was effective for occurrence of tea leaf rollers . <TR>
<TR> For even smaller tea tortrixes the effect was recognized but to a little smaller extent . <TR>
<TR> The simple equipment for photographing the appearance of preparing powdered tea by the digital camera was developed , and the tea color was analyzed to become numerical , and the conditions for expressing " clearness " and steaming which were good were obtained . <TR>
<TR> Comparisons of the varieties of preparing powdered tea , the pluck cultivation method , the steaming degree and the clearness degree indicated that evaluation of the steaming degree reflected the result of operation of the steam heat . <TR>
<TR> Then the biregressive formula and the decisive counting of the steaming degree and the clearness were obtained . <TR>
<TR> Comparison and examination between the steaming degree in last year and the color information from the biregressive formula were performed . <TR>
<TR> The author has developed a mesh ‐ unit analysis method of static landscape images using the eye mark recorder as a direct determination method of characteristic visual behaviors to allow a quantitative evaluation of village landscapes . <TR>
<TR> As a result it became possible to quantify psychological evaluation of landscape from attention characteristic indexes such as diffusion of focus of attention and degree of concentration . <TR>
<TR> The degree of concentration became higher as the touch of village , favorable images and image fixation increased , while the diffusion of focus of attention decreased . <TR>
<TR> Analysis of the landscape images by setting landscape evaluation and visual cognition indexes respectively on ordinate and abscissa can lead to clarification of the relation among constituents within the images and landscape evaluation . <TR>
<TR> This paper introduces the research results on heat and drought stress resistance in the reproductive growth stage of snap bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) . <TR>
<TR> Under heat and drought stress , morphological and physiological differences in growth occur such as cultivation optimal timing , plant water physiology , and photosynthesis parameter , depending on genotype . <TR>
<TR> The water content of leaves is deeply related with heat and drought stress resistance . <TR>
<TR> Resistant cultivars suppress drop in leaf water content in heat and drought , by decreasing the growth of above-ground part and water potential of leaves . <TR>
<TR> Therefore , as the evaluation index of heat and drought stress resistance of this crop , the water content of leaves is more suitable than water potential . <TR>
<TR> The study aimed to collect and collate information on the development , production , and commercialization of recombinant plants for drugs , survey the present state of companies which develop the plants , and classify them for the purpose of contributing to the preparation of assessment standards for food safety . <TR>

<TR> In the natural forest of the cypress ( Thujopsis dolabrata ) of the basin of the Ohata River , Aomori Prefecture , which had been selectively felled 5 - 30 years before , the generating status of the seedling and sapling was investigated . <TR>
<TR> The selective felling was based on the execution method established by Mr. Kyosuke Matsukawa in 1935 . <TR>
<TR> As a result , more than 5,000 seedlings / ha were confirmed even in every forest stand , after whose felling 5 years had passed . <TR>
<TR> Therefore , it was considered that the renewal had been sufficiently finished 5 years after felling . <TR>
<TR> And it was possible to grasp the renewal pattern of Thujopsis dolabrata with the time course . <TR>
<TR> Though hoof disease is abounding in the accident of disease and injury , other locomotorial disease is more frequent in the culling accident in lactating and beef cattle . <TR>
<TR> It is indicated that the hoof causes the injury of the other locomotorium . <TR>
<TR> In beef cattle , the change of the hoof influences the bone directly , affecting soft tissues . <TR>
<TR> In the meantime , in lactating dairy cow , the change of the hoof injures the soft tissue , and it shifts to the bone . <TR>
<TR> In the treatment of the hoof disease , it is desirable that the treatment interval is gradually extended after " biodynamic treatment " except for the infectious disease . <TR>
<TR> Sex pheromones are used as agricultural chemicals for pest control in three aspects of occurrence survey , mass attraction and killing , and communication disturbance . <TR>
<TR> Occurrence survey is done in order to predict optimum timing of insecticide spraying beforehand . <TR>
<TR> Pheromones do not kill female insects , but show an effect by catching a large number of male insects . <TR>
<TR> Synthetic pheromones are sprayed on the field so as to prevent mating by obstructing communication between male and female insects . <TR>

<TR> Stevia and licorice at high concentration were detected from a seasoned kelp and seasoned dried plum . <TR>
<TR> There were foods suspected illegal labeling , and administrative measures for proper indication of natural additives too should be considered . <TR>
<TR> Seasonal variation of chlorophyll and nutrient salt at survey points in offing of Motta Cape , Hokkaido was surveyed to contribute to forecast of aquatic resource fluctuation and fishing ground formation . <TR>
<TR> Chlorophyll density along the coasts showed high level in April , while that offshore areas did not show remarkable seasonal fluctuation . <TR>
<TR> Its peak in spring was supposed to fall on April 〜 June due to decrease in nitrate content . <TR>
<TR> Nutrient salt showed high density in the winter . <TR>
<TR> The mass transfer phenomenon in a carrier is examined in lactic fermentation by immobilization lactic bacteria . <TR>
<TR> Simulation shows that storage of a growth inhibitor ( lactic acid in a free state ) is observed in the carrier . <TR>
<TR> In addition , peculiar diffusion behavior of the lactate ion is clarified . <TR>
<TR> That is , lactic acid in a free state and hydrogen ion are diffused outside from the inside of the carrier at the starting ‐ up stage of both batch and continuous fermentation , but lactate ion is diffused inside from the surface of the carrier . <TR>
<TR> This is to occur by addition of basic solution for controlling pH of the culture solution . <TR>
<TR> It is shown that the production rate of lactic acid is improved by utilizing a buffer instead of the basic solution to lower diffusing inside the lactate ion carrier . <TR>
<TR> Development is carried out for a riding type direct sowing machine which performs paddy rice stripe submerged seeding at the efficiency of 30a / h , keeping seeding depth and density constant , and the prototype is built . <TR>
<TR> The problem is clarified by carring out a preliminary test for part of it . <TR>
<TR> At the fifth day after puddling of the field , it is in the sate of soft and hard soil being mixed , and rice straws are conspicuous at the surface , since the drainage is insufficient . <TR>
<TR> Channel cross section shape differs depending on the sate of channel making area , and hardness of the soil surface affected the channel shape maintenance . <TR>

<TR> Wire stretching of the new H ‐ type overhead wire timber collecting system was able to be easily operated by attaching so as a positioning device to recognize the position of a whisting bucket . <TR>
<TR> This paper showed the measurement result of each work ‐ in ‐ process of the timber collecting . <TR>
<TR> It was pointed out that this new H ‐ type whisting bucket was promising but repeated examinations were required in future . <TR>
<TR> Irrigation , drainage and reclamation engineering business is varied and each field has large subject . <TR>
<TR> It becomes very difficult for each individual designer to grasp all standards , guidelines and technical problems and to use his knowledge to design . <TR>
<TR> By making technical database , information should be occasionally updated and stored to be timely used for daily job . <TR>
<TR> For this purpose , technical information is controlled through the Intranet 's web page . <TR>
<TR> Sweden steel is used for the grapple of this equipment to realize excellent durability and multipurpose use . <TR>
<TR> Powerful transporting force is realized by adopting a belt system in the conveying mechanism . <TR>
<TR> The proportional control function enables the change of the gripping force of the grapple so that the damage is prevented by changing the force upon diameter of a 57 cm 〜 5 cm range lumbers . <TR>
<TR> In addition , various control by the 16 bit microcomputer is also possible . <TR>
<TR> Seedling raising box weight lightening techniques by mixing light artificial bed soil and mountain soil were examined for the elimination of raising box carrying task . <TR>
<TR> Artificial bed soil on market mixed of vermiculite and sphagnum peat and adjusted to pH 4.5 with phosphoric acid was tested . <TR>
<TR> This artificial bed soil with small weight per unit volume and high water holding capacity and phosphate content brought about a lightening of total weight of raising box and increasing in the water holding capacity and phosphate absorption by seedling with higher mixing ratio to mountain soil . <TR>
<TR> However , use of whole ‐ volume artificial bed soil is not practical because of lower seedling mat strength . <TR>
<TR> Artificial soil mixing ratio for practically optimal litening effects was 70 % ensuring equivalent mat strength to that of whole ‐ volume mountain soil . <TR>
<TR> In 14 cases ( 6 men and 8 women , aged 23 - 80 years ) of patients with the above pain , the effectiveness of weak galvanic stimulation ( I ) was evaluated from the pain threshold value estimated by the algesiometer , the change in the visual-sense analog score , and the patient 's satisfaction degree . <TR>
<TR> The I was applied for a total of 10 minutes at 0.5 - 20 Hz and 300 μA , centering around the pressure spot . <TR>
<TR> The pain threshold value significantly rose after 10 minutes compared with the values shown before the treatment . <TR>
<TR> The visual-sense analog score was significantly lowered , and the patient 's satisfaction was also good . <TR>
<TR> From the above , the I was considered to be effective for treatment of the above pain . <TR>
<TR> The verification as to whether the selection of recipients as well as the brain death decision were appropriately and properly carried out has been severely performed , but it can be scarcely said that sufficient consideration has been given to the feeling of the donor 's family . <TR>
<TR> This study intended to carry out the groping on an ideal way of the mental care for the donor 's family , considering this point . <TR>
<TR> The literature research which covered studies of this kind in foreign countries was carried out in this fiscal year . <TR>
<TR> The number of the papers concerning the mental care in the transplantations reported between 1966 and 2002 was 49 in all , but the objects of most researches were recipients among the research objects . <TR>
<TR> Since the reference result showed that there were two reports on the mental care for donors and only one report of 1998 on the mental care for donor 's families , it was clarified how scanty the researches on the mental care for donors were even in foreign countries . <TR>
<TR> The origin of the airway remodeling due to airway inflammation was examined using the components in the airway local sputum of the toddler asthma in its crisis early stage . <TR>
<TR> As the result , in the bronchial asthma group who repeated the stridor , the MMP-9 concentration concerned in the airway remodeling was higher as compared with that in the first-time stridor group of the children who were later diagnosed as toddler asthma . <TR>
<TR> And this MMP-9 concentration in the first-time stridor group showed significant positive correlations with the ECP derived from eosinophils which were the airway inflammation mediators or the neutrophil elastase concentration derived from neutrophils . <TR>
<TR> It was indicated from the above result that the airway inflammation due to neutrophils as well as eosinophils from the suckling stage might have already been concerned in induction of the airway remodeling . <TR>
<TR> Branched IPMT is emitting the edge in the mucus pancreas cancer advocated by Ohashi et al. as pancreatic carcinoma with the good prognosis . <TR>
<TR> Though branched IPMT was confused by the pancreatic duct expansion form with the pancreas mucoid cyst tumor , it is widely known that these are different diseases by recognizing the interstitial tissue which resembles the ovarium . <TR>
<TR> And , the difference with carcinoma in situ ( CIS ) which is the precursor lesion of the pancreatic duct cancer of the infiltration becomes a discussion for this tumor , since it belongs to the tumor in the pancreatic duct . <TR>
<TR> Though expansion , mucus production , papillary proliferation of the pancreatic duct , etc.is important in the differentiation , there is some the differentiation on the difficult case . <TR>
<TR> The following were examined in spontaneous chronic pancreatitis of the male WBN / Kob rat : Its crisis and progression , the relation between apoptosis of pancreatic acinic cells and the T cells , and the therapeutic effect of tacrolimus . <TR>
<TR> At the age of 15 weeks , the CD4 - and CD8-positive cells infiltrated the pancreatic leaflets or between the leaflets , and especially the CD8-positive T cells were located close to the pancreatic acinic cells with the apoptosis caused . <TR>
<TR> The apoptosis of the pancreatic acinic cells , the infiltration of the CD4 - and CD8-positive cells , and the progression of pancreatitis were almost perfectly suppressed by administration of tacrolimus . <TR>
<TR> It was indicated that the CD8-positive T cells fulfiled an important role in induction of apoptosis of the pancreatic acinic cells and in progression of chronic pancreatitis , and tacrolimus could become a therapeutic drug for chronic pancreatitis . <TR>
<TR> The Fukukoukai Soumu Hospital opened as a mental care / complication ward on the occasion of the transfer to a new hospital in June , 2001 . <TR>
<TR> A study was performed on the effect of this change in the environment , in the aspects such as the open counter , curtains positioned to maintain the space around the bed , or the relation with the nurse as the human environment . <TR>
<TR> As a result , the number of complaints of patients did not change much through a day . <TR>
<TR> It indicates that the specific weight on the limited nurses working at night or holidays is large . <TR>
<TR> It was recognized that the weight of the effect of human environment is large , and it is necessary to deal with by the ward as a whole , not only by each individual . <TR>
<TR> Also , it seems to be effective to prepare and utilize the physical , spacial and human environment according to the situation of the patient . <TR>
<TR> Regarding Surgical Margin to be ensured in hepatectomy for hepatic metastasis of colic cancer , more than 10 mm is recommended in part of the literature , but many cases were also experienced , in which it did not recur even when the hepatectomy was performed closest possible to the tumor unavoidably . <TR>
<TR> In the excision examples of esophageal cancer and liver cancer , the relationship between pathologic findings of the surrounding lymph nodes and the recurrence was examined . <TR>
<TR> Results : In order to completely prevent the stump relapse in the direction of hepatic parenchyma and the Glisson sheath in the hepatic metastatic excision of colic cancer , Surgical Margin of more than 5 mm is recommended , but it seemed that in more than 95 % of the cases even Margin of more than 2 mm was sufficient . <TR>
<TR> However , the progress in the Glisson sheath direction tends to be slightly wide , and the attention is needed . <TR>
<TR> On the 3 - to 4-year-old infants attending the metropolitan private nursery , the daily work of the life in the garden and how to play , namely the effect of the nurture program on the infant activity , were analyzed in detail . <TR>
<TR> And the relation between the lifestyle habit and the activity in the home was also analyzed . <TR>
<TR> By the activity quantity measurement using the active tracer , it was proven that the activity was being averaged with other infants in the group life . <TR>
<TR> It restricts the activity of active infants and promotes the activity of ordinary infants . <TR>
<TR> It was considered that it was necessary to adopt the outside play or to elevate the activity content in the room in order to increase the activity quantity per day . <TR>
<TR> The purpose of the examination was to confirm the safety and the effectiveness of the mini-transplantation for malignant hematologic disease . <TR>
<TR> In the hope of improvement of the prognosis in a poor prognosis case of malignant lympoma , the mini-transplantation was enforced for the case who had the HLA-compatible sibling and from whom the informed consent could be obtained . <TR>
<TR> The malignant lymphoma-related diseases were also indicated , and multiple myeloma and ATLL also became the objects . <TR>
<TR> The side effect of conditioning of treatment of the mini-transplantation and GVHD were slight , and the positive conversion of CMV-Ag by delay of the hemopoietic recovery and unrecovery of the immune strength after transplantation was frequently recognized , but in general the treatment was secure . <TR>
<TR> Regarding the usefulness , the follow-up study on the future long-term prognosis is necessary . <TR>
<TR> The progress of 2 cases in therapy for pruritus cutaneous probably triggered by stress was reported . <TR>

<TR> Coalitio disorder of arch of vertebra was recognized at the 13.0 % of the remainder . <TR>
<TR> There was no patient who complained of the backache for this coalitio disorder either , and the effect could not be completely observed in postoperative result in several years . <TR>
<TR> As examinations for fulminant hepatitis and the relationship disease , examinations for hepatitis viral marker , degree of hepatonecrosis , and hepatic reserve are important . <TR>
<TR> According to new pathological classification , fulminant hepatitis and late onset hepatic failure ( LOHF ) are classified into viral , autoimmune , drug-induced , agnogenic , and unclassified . <TR>
<TR> The cause is closely related to the prognosis , and the lifesaving rate is low in hepatitis B virus carrier and autoimmune case . <TR>
<TR> The degree of hepatonecrosis is diagnosed based on the serum transaminase concentration . <TR>
<TR> Prothrombin time and total bilirubin concentration are useful for the evaluation of the hepatic reserve . <TR>
<TR> Though in the congenital biliary dilatation , the expansion of intrahepatic bile duct can be produced in addition to the expansion of common bile duct , cholangiectasis defined as a intrahepatic bile duct is rare . <TR>
<TR> In this paper , disease state ( Caroli disease ) which showed the expansion mainly on intrahepatic bile duct peripheral side which Caroli reported was outlined , and it described the relation of the carcinogenesis . <TR>
<TR> First , concept and etiology of Caroli disease were described , and clinical feature and pathological form of Caroli disease were described . <TR>
<TR> Next , background factor of the carcinogenesis of the intrahepatic bile duct cancer was described , and the mechanism in which bile duct epithelial dysplasia by the intrahepatic calculosis occurred also described corresponding possibility for the carcinogenesis of Caroli disease . <TR>
<TR> Finally , the intrahepatic bile duct cancer was recognized , after the liver transplantation for Caroli disease was carried out , and the case ( 58-year-old women ) diagnosed as intrahepatic bile duct cancer it infiltrates to the bile duct which complicated Caroli disease , was presented . <TR>
<TR> CA19-9 is known to be highly specific for pancreatic carcinoma and biliary tract cancer , but it also shows high values in the advanced cases of gastric cancer or colorectal cancer . <TR>
<TR> The reported case of CA19-9 producing gastric adenocarcinoma was in a 69-year-old woman , examined in our hospital with hematemesis as a chief complaint . <TR>
<TR> In the examination finding on admission , obvious rises of CEA and CA19-9 were recognized , it was diagnosed as differentiated adenocarcinoma from upper digestive tract endoscopic finding , and total gastrectomy , splenectomy , cholecystectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed . <TR>
<TR> In the postoperative immunohistological finding , the cytoplasm of the cancer cell was strongly positive for CEA stain and CA19-9 stain . <TR>
<TR> After operation , CEA and CA19-9 lowered obviously , the postoperative progress was good and the patient left hospital on the 30th day , and the recurrence has not been recognized afterwards . <TR>
<TR> In the intracystic breast cancer , the cancer nest mainly exists in the cyst of clinical size , and it is difficult to differentiate from the benign intracystic tumor . <TR>
<TR> The result of clinicopathological examination of four cases of intracystic breast cancer is reported with bibliographical consideration . <TR>
<TR> For each case , the clinical feature , image finding and operative / pathological finding are shown , and clinical and pathological items are examined . <TR>
<TR> Examination finding , mammography finding , the progress and histopathological finding of the representative case are shown . <TR>

<TR> Extensive extramural progress is often observed , and sufficient attention seems to be necessary in deciding the excision range . <TR>
<TR> The carry-over of infantile liver diseases to the adult is discussed from the viewpoint of liver transplantation . <TR>
<TR> As the problem on the donor , the diversity of the donor selection , and long-term observation of the recipient and the donor liver are described . <TR>
<TR> As the problem that the carry-over patient faces after the childhood liver transplantation , hepatic disorders due to the surgical complication , rejection , de novo autoimmune hepatitis , long-term problems of immunosuppressive therapy , and the problem on development growth are shown . <TR>
<TR> In addition , liver transplantation for adult biliary atresia is described . <TR>
<TR> Recognition of expression and emotion are basic functions of human relations , and they are very important in the social life . <TR>
<TR> Though emotional reaction is said to be expressed as an autonomic nerve reaction , the expression is distinguished in communicating with others in a moment , and emotional reaction may be produced . <TR>
<TR> The recognition dysfunction is advocated as a symptom of schizophrenia , and the effect of understanding of the expression and emotion is also important . <TR>
<TR> The closing one 's eyes reaction time when showing the photograph of " cry " and " laugh " of the baby for schizophrenic was observed . <TR>
<TR> With the use of recombinant restricted nucleocapsid protein , we developed ELISA method to detect specific SARS coronavirus-specific IgM antibody ( MAC-ELISA ) . <TR>
<TR> The study result showed that MAC-ELISA was able to detect SARS coronavirus with 100 % specificity , suggesting its usability in diagnosis . <TR>
<TR> Using a series of blood samples collected from SARS patients , we determined how long it would take to get seroconversion . <TR>
<TR> The result showed that it would take median 8 days to get IgM seroconversion , and 100 % seroconversion was observed within 3 weeks . <TR>
<TR> As for IgG , it took median 11 days to get seroconversion . <TR>
<TR> Seroconversion of IgM occurs faster than IgG . <TR>
<TR> Since neutralizing test uses live SARS coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) , biologically contained facility ( BSL3 ) is required . <TR>
<TR> We created VSV-SARS-St19 , a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudo type bearing spike glycoprotein ( S protein ) . <TR>
<TR> Because this pseudo-type virus can not replicate , it is safe in an aspect of biological containment . <TR>
<TR> We conducted neutralizing test with serum samples taken from SARS-CoV patients and VSV-SARS-St19 . <TR>
<TR> The result showed that virus neutralizing test with VSV-SARS-St19 had excellent sensitivity and specificity . <TR>
<TR> This testing method is speedy and safe . <TR>
<TR> The comparison table was made concerning the details of the thin-layer chromatography ( TLC ) condition and the measurement condition in the quantitative method in the confirmation test of crude drugs published in the Japanese pharmacopoeia ( JP ) , Chinese pharmacopoeia ( CP ) and Korean pharmacopoeia ( KP ) . <TR>
<TR> In CP , the TLC method was introduced into the confirmation test of many crude drugs , and the complicated developing agents containing over 4 components were set , and the developing agents were also manifold . <TR>
<TR> And in the quantitative method many test methods except for the titrimetric method , TLC method , absorptiometry and HPLC method were also set . <TR>
<TR> In JP and KP , there were many things common to each other in the TLC condition and the HPLC condition in the quantitative method . <TR>
<TR> As a problem , there are the early retirement and nursing practice ability of the novice nursing staff . <TR>
<TR> In the literature examination , especially , the opinion and investigation research which reflected the actual condition of novice nursing staff was focused on . <TR>
<TR> The educational environment which could draw the force of the novice nursing staff was desirable and the educational environment necessary for the training was arranged which deduced the support content . <TR>
<TR> The bibliographic database used were those of the National Informatics Laboratories , the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare and the Japana Centra Revuo Medicina ver . 4 and the keywords were novice / new graduate / novice nursing person . <TR>
<TR> In order to lead to educational environment and support content necessary for the novice nursing staff training , the characteristics of novice nursing staff , process of the growth and those related factors were analyzed . <TR>
<TR> The results of two surgical approaches on fractures of the ulnar styloid process were retrospectively examined . <TR>
<TR> Surgeries were either performed from the palmar or dorsolateral sides . <TR>
<TR> Osteosynthesis was performed on two patients . osseous transplantation was performed on 13 from dorsal side of the hand , and on 19 from the palmar side . <TR>
<TR> Osteosynthesis showed little influence on the treatment results of fractures of the ulnar styloid process . <TR>
<TR> Prevention of postoperative respiratory infection and significance of the respiration physiotherapy are described . <TR>
<TR> Purpose and indication of postural drainage are outlined . <TR>
<TR> Chest X ‐ ray examination before postural drainage and inspection using thorax computed tomography , selection of the posture and method of expiratory squeezing are explained . <TR>
<TR> Contraindication , accidents and complications are explained . <TR>
<TR> In order to examine the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) which is the ω3 unsaturated fatty acid on the vascular endothelium function of the ADPKD patients , the effect of the EPA administration on the pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) was examined . <TR>
<TR> No significant difference was found in the renal function ( Ccr ) between the administered group and the non-administered group . <TR>
<TR> In both the ankle joint / overarm blood pressure ratio ( ABI ) and PWV , no significance was found between the administered group and the non-administered group . <TR>
<TR> In the comparison between before and after the administration , PWV did not show the significant difference , but ABI showed the significant decrease . <TR>
<TR> There was no significant difference in the renal volume between before and after the administration . <TR>
<TR> Because the EPA administration for the ADPKD patients improved ABI , its usefulness was indicated . <TR>
<TR> The present status of surgical treatment of dystonia based on the experience of surgical treatment for dystonia is explained . <TR>
<TR> At this time , positive stimulation is appropriate when systemic dystonia is judged from the viewpoint of low invasiveness of the brain depth stimulation . <TR>
<TR> For the cervix dystonia , the botulinus toxin injection to the affected muscle is appropriate when conservative treatment can not satisfy the patient . <TR>
<TR> The selective peripheral nerve interception method should be considered when the result is not good by the botulinum . <TR>
<TR> The writing cramp is most resistant to treatment among dystonia diseases , and pharmacotherapy is invalid . <TR>
<TR> Recently , a method of local injection with botulinus toxin to muscles getting tensed in writing such as forearm is effective , though the method is a symptomatic treatment . <TR>
<TR> Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) indicates oxygen radicals such as super oxide , hydrogen peroxide , hydroxyl radical . <TR>
<TR> These ROS induce DNA lesions , peroxidation of the lipid , protein denaturation , etc. from the high reactivity , and it has the noxious action for the organism . <TR>
<TR> The oxidative stress indicates the failure by such oxygen radical that the organism is exposed . <TR>
<TR> In this paper , the mechanism of the oxidative stress generation was described , and the way of the response of the organism to the oxidative stress was described . <TR>
<TR> And , the molecular mechanism on gene expression as an oxidative stress response and induction of the apoptosis was described . <TR>
<TR> It was explained that ROS also fulfiled the role as a signal transduction factor in adding . <TR>
<TR> For postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) , the therapy mainly performed in the field of pain clinic is outlined . <TR>
<TR> The International Dolorology Society has defined PHN as a chronic ache with the degeneration of the skin of dermatome after acute herpes zoster . <TR>
<TR> As the main therapies for PHN , there are nerve block therapy ( sympathetic nerve block , sensory nerve block , etc . ) , pharmacotherapy ( antidepressive drugs , anticonvulsants , antianxiety agents , local skin salve treatment , etc . ) , physiotherapy ( near infrared irradiation therapy , low power laser irradiation , etc . ) and other therapies . <TR>
<TR> For these therapies , the effects are outlined . <TR>
<TR> There is no perfect prophylaxis and therapy of PHN , and in the treatment , it is important to prevent the injury of nerve , removing the feeling of pain of the patient , in the acute stage . <TR>
<TR> A case of a 33-year-old woman with heterotopic endometriosis was reported . <TR>
<TR> Her chief complaint was subcutaneous nodule in her left lower abdomen . <TR>
<TR> Her disease was diagnosed as endometriosis by clinical observations and histopathological findings . <TR>
<TR> Resection was performed . <TR>
<TR> Recurrence was not observed 4 months after the operation . <TR>
<TR> The algorithm which can comprehensively depict the homoeologous chromosome region using the gene chip data in all genomes was prepared to be the homozygosis fingerprint method . <TR>
<TR> The DNA extracted from the peripheral blood of 3 survival patients was used to identify the alveolar microlithiasis responsible gene . <TR>
<TR> The method could detect even the homoeologous chromosome region caused by a consanguineous marriage before 20 generations with a probability over 95 % . <TR>
<TR> In the common region of the homoeologous chromosome region 50 genes were present . <TR>
<TR> It is supposed that in alveolar microlithiasis , phosphorus ion removal in alveolar space is hindered by the SLC34A2 function loss , and the micro stones are generated . <TR>
<TR> It is indicated that the homozygosis fingerprint method is a powerful technique for identifying disease gene . <TR>
<TR> Falls prevention is emphasized in the causal relation with femoral neck fracture . <TR>
<TR> Prevention for nursing and bedridden conditions are expanding for the national business . <TR>
<TR> Cooperation of orthopedists , physical therapists , occupational therapists , nurses and locomotorium therapeutists is important . <TR>
<TR> Falls prevention from the viewpoint of the locomotorium rehabilitation , motor program for falls prevention and risk management are outlined . <TR>
<TR> It is important to put in the work so that the elderly people can take fruitful life by falls prevention . <TR>
<TR> When position is checked based on bone structure using CT-Liniac system , there is a case that the position is not matched with the plan by using flat panel portal image ( FPPI ) . <TR>
<TR> We analyzed respiratory movement in each part of a lung with CT images used for the position matching . <TR>
<TR> There were 100 cases which lung stereotactic radiotherapy was carried out . <TR>
<TR> It was suggested that when CT images are taken for a treatment plan , an instruction for constant respiration and monitoring of respiration are important to be carried out . <TR>
<TR> The respiratory movement and its characteristics are necessary to be considered with FPPI . <TR>
<TR> Substitution of sphygmopalpation by blood vessel echography is examined for 74 patients ( hypertension , hyperlipidemia , cancer , menopausal syndrome , diabetes mellitus , healthy human ) without rheumatism . <TR>
<TR> Present results showed that the pulse changed from smoothness , truth , and minute to astringent , falsehood , and greatness by the aging . <TR>
<TR> By measuring the blood vessel echo of both the cervix and the hand in the hypertensive patient , comparison should be examined . <TR>
<TR> In the menopausal syndrome , the chord pulse of the hand is characteristic , and the waveform is also easy to change , because the autonomous nerve is unstable . <TR>
<TR> The situation of fall-related injuries in all the hospitals ( 8 facilities ) and all the bed-eqiuipped clinics ( 7 facilities ) in the region of the Fuchu District Medical Association in April , 2004 〜 March , 2005 , the tried remedies , and the effectiveness , were studied . <TR>
<TR> The total number of the cases reported to " the medical safety committee " was 3,320 . <TR>
<TR> There were 495 cases of fall-related injury in a year , and for 68 cases out of them , the situation of fall , tried remedy and the effectiveness were studied . <TR>
<TR> About 60 % of the falls occurred in the patient 's room , and there were many cases accompanied by the excretion around the bed at a time zone with few helping hands . <TR>
<TR> The remedies after generation of the case were judged to be effective in the most part , however , for patients with dementia , it was difficult to deal with . <TR>
<TR> Also , a poster was prepared for enlightening the prevention of fall by external factors , and was distributed to all the medical institutions and the nursing insurance facilities , in which the members are related , in the region . <TR>
<TR> The effect of weight loss on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , leptin and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels was examined in 25 female obesity patients . <TR>
<TR> Weight loss effects of 7.5 kg of the body weight and of 2.7 decreases in BMI were observed . <TR>
<TR> The rate of change in blood supersensitive CRP , leptin and PAI-1 correlated positively with that of the somatic fat volume . <TR>
<TR> Improvement of the obesity by the weight loss guidance is very important from the viewpoint of the prevention of arteriosclerosis . <TR>
<TR> By deciphering the talks from families of nerve intractable disease patients in family interviews , we understand the metaphor expressed in talks , and then examine the points to " make the assistance through conversation to be creative " . <TR>
<TR> We target five families who have been giving care to ALS patients at home . <TR>
<TR> The ALS patient QOL is interlinked with the QOL of patient 's family . <TR>
<TR> There are two types for family 's behavioral traits ; <TR>
<TR> " respect of individualization " and " respect of identification " . <TR>
<TR> The symptom makes varicella infection disease of immunological high risk groups such as infantile leukemia child patient and child patient of malignant tumor into the seriousness , and is also prolonged in the progress and may die . <TR>

<TR> and prevention and future measures ( sudden deaths judged by clinicians , frequency of sudden deaths , prevention of sudden deaths , and validity evaluation of curing methods ) . 2 ) Alzheimer 's disease shows symptoms in advanced age and slow but sure progress , and causes the death of cerebral nerve cells . <TR>
<TR> In this seminar the report was also made on the significance of Alzheimer 's disease , elucidation of symptom mechanisms , and clinical diagnosis and curing methods ( genes , environment factors , mechanisms of PHF and amyloid formaiton , and mechanism of nerve cell death ) . <TR>
<TR> Present state is grasped from historical data of occupational allergy , and epidemiological prospects based on this results are outlined . <TR>
<TR> Data on the titled disease are almost all from clinics . <TR>
<TR> Research should be promoted in cooperation with epidemiologists , and all aspects should be clarified . <TR>
<TR> Backup of administration including improvement of law systems , establishment of research facilities and dealing with scientific societies concerned are also desired . <TR>
<TR> Cilazapril ( I ) was given to 16 cases , and valnidipin hydrochloric acid ( II ) to 13 cases clinical usefulness was assessed by ABPM . <TR>
<TR> II was higher in the clinical availability . <TR>
<TR> Applications for treating systolic blood pressure and borderline hypertension , severe hypertension , Dipper type hypertension , and nocturnal hypertension were greater than ( I ) . <TR>
<TR> In spite of high day ‐ time hypotension , the nocturnal hypotension rate was small , and blood pressure rise frequency after and before getting up was small , and the rising rate was smaller . <TR>
<TR> As test results of acute myocardial infarction , this paper describes electrocardiograms , heart muscle deviation enzymes , myoglobin , cardiac myosin light chains , echo cardiographs , nuclear medicine examination , etc . <TR>
<TR> And , it also shows differentiation from other diseases . <TR>
<TR> In the meantime , this paper describes electrocardiograms , Holter electrocardiograms , exercise electrocardiograms , nuclear medicine examination , etc. as test results of angina pectoris . <TR>
<TR> In addition , this paper also describes the examination necessary for long ‐ term management of ischemic heart disease . <TR>
<TR> For normal adult male volunteers of 12 persons , 90 mg and 180 mg and 360 mg of Otenzepad ( I ) capsules were administered one time , and safety , tolerance and pharmacodynamics were examined . <TR>
<TR> In 180 mg and 360 mg administration group , I unaltered substance concentration in blood plasma also increased in proportion to dose . <TR>
<TR> In addition , there was some correlation on heart rate increasing around plasma concentration time ‐ of ‐ arrival . <TR>
<TR> There were movement and headache based on pharmacological action . <TR>
<TR> Lipid analysis for the mucosa in small and large intestinein Crohn 's disease , and in large intestine in ulcerative colitis was carried out . <TR>
<TR> No difference in phospholipid compositions between inflammatory and normal regions was observed . <TR>
<TR> Regarding fatty acid compositions , arachidonic acid contents contained in phosphatidylethanolamine ( P ) at the inflamed region in Chrohn 's disease were increased . <TR>
<TR> A plasmalogen type existed in P , and was increased in I . <TR>
<TR> On palliative operation for esophageal cancer , this paper describes the results of palliative ( A ) and bypass operation ( B ) and indication . <TR>
<TR> The patients were 71 C0 cases and 8 B cases out of excision cases . <TR>
<TR> Direct mortality rate by operation was 9.7 % , 11.1 % and 12.5 % in the thoractic esophageal cancer A group , the hypopharyngeal cervical esophageal cancer A group and the thoractic esophageal cancer B group respectively . <TR>
<TR> A similar tendency is shown in hospital mortality rate and invasion in A and B was significant . <TR>
<TR> Preoperative progress extent diagnosis was accurately carried out , and selection of the titled operation seemed to be suitable for the cases in which the non ‐ curing factor would be other organ infiltration alone . <TR>
<TR> The basis of steps against decubitus infection is prophylaxis rather than treatment . <TR>
<TR> The high isolation frequency of resistant microbes is observed in patients at chronic stage of decubitus , but effect on patients are small . <TR>
<TR> Therefore , the patients with chronic decubitus do not become the objects of antibiotic chemotherapy , but their contorl as the sources of environmental contamination become necessary . <TR>
<TR> Environmental precaution by cleaning , and hand washing are required . <TR>
<TR> Safety and tolerance of KC ‐ 404 eye drops for external application to eyes and anterior ocular segments of healthy volunteers were examined . <TR>
<TR> Abnormalities were not considered in low concentration ( 0.005 % ) and in high concentration ( 0.01 % ) of both of KC ‐ 404 eyedrop and bases . <TR>
<TR> The main symptoms were irritation , but hypesthesia was not considered . <TR>
<TR> Safety and tolerance of this medicine were confirmed based on the results . <TR>
<TR> Treatment outcomes are examined on matters in the title . <TR>
<TR> Many cases needed long term treatment for cure or improvement of olfactory disorders by the administration of steroid collunarium . <TR>
<TR> Side effects were irritation during nasal dripping , and change or temporary discontinuance of drug was carried out . <TR>
<TR> Collunarium therapy by suspension cephalic presentation of steroids as therapy for olfactory disorders is regarded as possibly having therapeutic effect on olfactory disorders . <TR>
<TR> Induction of lowering of systemic phylaxis function , etc. exists for endogenous mycotic endophthalmitis . <TR>
<TR> Its diagnosis is often carried out by medical history and clinical observation . <TR>
<TR> The most characteristic clinical observation is yellowish white lesion scattered in posterior part of the eyegrounds , and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber and in the vitreous body might be observed previously . <TR>
<TR> First choice of treatments is systemic administration of antifungal agents such as miconazole , fluconazole and itraconazole , and if no efficacy is observed , vitrectomy is conducted . <TR>
<TR> Hypertension is a risk factor of cerebral infarction crisis and recurrence . <TR>
<TR> In younger age , advanced hypertension , and patients with cerebral hemorrhage , the effectiveness of a hypotension treatment after cerebral infarction was not always established , and it was described that hypotensive effect could be expected . <TR>
<TR> Acute phase of cerebral infarction awaits natural hypotension as a principle , and hypotension as a principle , and hypotension , speed and kinds of hypotensives in recurrence prevention of cerebral apoplexy chronic phase should be taken into account . <TR>
<TR> And , this paper described that hypotension is slowly made throughout the day by setting a hypotension objective high , since night blood pressure is often high , in cerebral infarction patients . <TR>
<TR> 10 mg / day of arotinolol hydrochloride were administered to 7 hypertension patients ( 37 years old on average ) and 9 normal blood pressure volunteers to examine its insulin sensitivity . <TR>
<TR> Administering the drug significantly decreased blood pressure from 155mmHg to 133mmHg . <TR>
<TR> The drug did not change insulin sensitivity significantly . <TR>
<TR> The drug did not change lipid metabolism significantly . <TR>
<TR> This study examines the effects of SD ‐ 3211 on circulatory dynamics in 10 patients ( 58.7 years old on average ) , and compared the effects with those of other vasodilators examined with the same method . <TR>
<TR> Administering 50 mg / day of the drug for 6 to 8 weeks decreased peripheral resistance as well as blood pressure . <TR>
<TR> The drug did not affect hear rate , and activate the sympathetic nerves . <TR>
<TR> The circulatory ‐ dynamic effects of the drug were similar to those of existing Ca antagonists . <TR>
<TR> Recently it has become dear there are clinical phenomena of multidrug resistance and that the mdr gene is involved in the expression of resistance codes for P glycoprotein ( PGP ) . <TR>
<TR> PGP is present in the plasma membrane and is thought to work as a pump to eliminate anticancer drugs . <TR>
<TR> PGP is present not only in cancer cells but also in normal cells , performing various physiologic functions . <TR>
<TR> Calcium antagonists and some quinolines are effective in overcoming drug resistance by inhibiting the elimination of cancer drugs . <TR>
<TR> A 66 ‐ year ‐ old male case visiting the hospital with chief complaint of epigastralgia is introduced . <TR>
<TR> Results of upper GI examination shown O ‐ IIc type lesion of 1.7 × 1.2 cm at esophageal Ei region and IIc + III type lesion of 2.9 × 2.6 cm at angular notch region . <TR>
<TR> As results of biopsy , either lesion also showed malignant image . <TR>
<TR> Multiple primer cancers with simultaneous early esophageal and stomach cancers was diagnosed and surgery was conducted . <TR>
<TR> In excision specimen , degrees of depth for esophageal and stomach lesions were m3 and m , respectively . <TR>
<TR> In 279 elderly people at special nursing homes for the elderly , a survey was made on changes with year in their ADL . <TR>
<TR> Forty percent of the subjects had deterioration in some activity item : Deterioration in " bathing " was seen most commonly . <TR>
<TR> Postures and heart rates in 7 elderly persons were monitored , who were subjected to the survey on ADL on the basis of their target heart rates . <TR>
<TR> The total periods of time where their heart rates exceeded the targets were long , while they were active intermittently in short consecutive times . <TR>
<TR> It seems necessary for welfare institutions for the aged to introduce detailed physical activity programs for preventing of progress and improving of disuse atrophy . <TR>
<TR> This paper explains concepts of personality disorders , and introduces classification into 4 groups and 11 kinds . <TR>
<TR> This paper also explains notes on psychotherapy for the disease ( I ) . <TR>
<TR> Moreover , this paper explains indication criteria of hospitalization and prescription examples for pharmacotherapy . <TR>
<TR> I includes the following points : 1 ) Rearing of therapeutic motives and alliance . 2 ) Attention to personal relation and behavioral pattern . 3 ) Action . 4 ) Countertransference . 5 ) Significance of " disillusion " in therapeutic relationships . <TR>
<TR> The subject was a 64 ‐ year ‐ old male , and the result of diagnosis was in reflux exophagitis after subtotal gastrectomy . <TR>
<TR> After operation , continuous all ‐ around ulcer and erosion were observedin the region from esophagogastric junction to middle esophagus , accompanied by white body . <TR>
<TR> Then , a dose of Foipan 300 mg / day was administered , and heartburn almost disappeared after 6 weeks . <TR>
<TR> The side effect was not recognized either . <TR>
<TR> Three patients ( 1 male , 2 females , 21 to 72 years of old ) in vegetative conditions of lowering consciousness level by injuries are examined to measure the changes of brain wave and cerebral blood flow after conducting acupuncture once a week for four months . <TR>
<TR> No apparent changes in consciousness levels , brain waves , and cerebral blood flows are observed . <TR>
<TR> But improvement in patient 's reactions , e.g. complexion changes , increase of eye ‐ opening ‐ times , and reactions chasing things by eyes , is observed . <TR>
<TR> These results indicate that stimulation by acupuncture affects to certain degrees on the central nervous systems . <TR>
<TR> Actual conditions for 21 cases with conducting heart transplantation ( I ) in foreign countries , with consent of committee of heart transplantation adaptation decision in Japan Circulation Society , was investigated . <TR>
<TR> This paper showes that average survival time in Japan for cases with I after operation was 20.82 ± 24.4 months , all cases degree I on NYHA cardiac function classification and rehabilitation rate at 6 month after transplantation , 100 % ( 15 / 15 ) . <TR>
<TR> The results suggest that in Japan , prognosis of cases with I was excellent and process observation after transplantation was appropriate . <TR>
<TR> One problems for I was the short supply of donor organs in various foreign countries , and continuation of voyage transplantation has been made difficult . <TR>
<TR> Progress of patients after transplantation announced officially and I should be conducted in Japan by overcoming social limitations . <TR>
<TR> Differences with I were examined by evaluation of heart disease of nontypical Fabry 's disease ( II ) in elderly cases lacking typical Fabry 's disease ( I ) symptoms . <TR>
<TR> All cases of II found from left ventricular hypertrophy showed electrocardiogram abnomalities with arrythmia and half of ( 4 / 7 ) showed left ventricular wall motion abnormality . <TR>
<TR> Mitral valve prolapse and shortening PQ interval characterized I were not observed . <TR>
<TR> In cases ( 5 / 7 ) treated by left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy , characteristic findings of I and findings similar to degeneration of myocardial cellular vacuoles were observed , and some cases ( 3 / 5 ) showed advanced fibrosis . <TR>
<TR> Accumulation of annual ring ‐ like inclusion bodies was not detected in myocardial endotherial cells . <TR>
<TR> The results of T cell epitope are described on the experimental autoimmune myocarditis ( EAM ) of rat prepared by each fraction of porcine myocardial myosin ( I ) . <TR>
<TR> Immunity by tail fragment of α ‐ chymotrypsin degraded I induced severe myocarditis in all cases . <TR>
<TR> The CN2 fraction of CNBr fragmented peptide of tail fraction ( II ) induced moderate myocarditis . <TR>
<TR> Like human myocardial myosin ( III ) immunity , various inflammatory cell infiltrations including multinucleated giant cell , tissue destruction , and fibrosis were observed in the myocaridial tissue of EAM . <TR>
<TR> In II was present 1070 〜 1165 ( RDCB9 ) corresponding to the peptide of III was contained , which only differed in amino acid ( 1161Cys → Val ) composition from III . <TR>
<TR> The different location of the epitope site of myocardial myosin from that of autoimmune myocarditis inducing site of bacteria , virus and mouse , suggested the multiple presence of myocarditis inducing epitope in the myocardial myosin and possibility of heteroimmune response for myocarditis pathology development by each epitope . <TR>
<TR> In case of terrorists by cult , Aum Shinrikyo recently , there was the first report of many cases of sarin poisoning . <TR>
<TR> Respiratory arrest was introduced at very early stage in serious cases . <TR>
<TR> Plasma cholinesterase values were obviously decreased in serious cases , but in middle and mild cases it was not always correlated with clinical symptoms . <TR>
<TR> It is proven that there were no delay and exacebration of such symptoms recognized in the part of other organophsphorus compound poisonings . <TR>
<TR> This paper explained pathophysiology , clinical symptoms , diagnosis and treatments for poisonings of organophosphorus compounds including sarin . <TR>
<TR> The following were studied in the case where chemical droplet was generated by mesh type ultrasonic wave atomization method : Relationship between the viscosity of a liquid and particle size distribution , and the relationship between the frequency distribution of a particle size mode and mesh diameter . <TR>
<TR> For the generation of chemical particles , a portable mesh type ultrasonic wave inhaler was used . <TR>
<TR> When glycerin / water system mixture liquid was used as chemical liquid at the viscosity of 1 〜 5 × 10 ‐ 3 kg / ( m s ) , and the mesh diameter on the ultrasonic vibrator was 3.8 〜 5.4 μm , the mean diameter of generated particle size was 20μm or less , which was a sufficient diameter range for medical application . <TR>
<TR> The average particle size of atomized particle became smaller as the viscosity became higher and the mesh diameter became smaller . <TR>
<TR> New surgical applications of the high ‐ output laser are being tried in addition to existing clinical applications . <TR>
<TR> Low ‐ output laser is applied to photochemical treatment and laser hyperthermia as the most up ‐ to ‐ date medical technology . <TR>

<TR> The development of a low ‐ priced laser equipment with superior durability and safety is desired . <TR>
<TR> This paper reports a 13 ‐ year ‐ old female patient with hepatic dysfunction after segmental liver transplantation from a live donor , who was given a liver protection agent and Sho ‐ saiko ‐ to . <TR>
<TR> Using Sho ‐ saiko ‐ to with immunosuppressive agents , such as cyclosporin and tacrolimus , did not markedly change the blood concentration of the immunosuppressive agents nor renal function . <TR>
<TR> The drug interaction was also examined . <TR>
<TR> Sho ‐ saiko ‐ to can be safely administered and be useful for patients after liver transplantation . <TR>
<TR> Atypical mycobacteriosis was found in 20 patients in 143 AIDS patients in the Metropolitan Komagome Hospital . <TR>
<TR> The mycobacteriosis of 16 patients was due to the infection with M.avium complex ( MAC ) and that of 4 patients with M.kansasii . <TR>
<TR> In the cases of MAC infection , an effectiveness rate of antituberculosis therapy was low but hte rate of high ‐ dose clarithromycin therapy was high . <TR>
<TR> In the cases of M.kansasii infection , therapies with isoniazid , rifampicin , and ethambutol were effective . <TR>
<TR> This study reviewed the quantitative relation between neuromuscular diseases and rimmed vacuoles ( RV ) in 738 muscular biopsy samples in Hokkaido . <TR>
<TR> Among 28 samples with many RVs , 16 samples that could not be classified into conventional disease groups were classified into 2 groups by retained musculi quadriceps femoris in the early stage . <TR>
<TR> We focused on 11 clinically similar samples in which the muscle was retained and specific muscular weakness distribution was observed . <TR>
<TR> All the samples were from isolated development cases with the average age of 35 . <TR>
<TR> The major treatment in the orthopaedics ( I ) is not pharmacotherapy . <TR>
<TR> A great majority of I patients are hospitalized for surgery . <TR>
<TR> When they are hospitalized , they often carry non ‐ orthopaedics drugs , and othopaedists are not interested in the drugs . <TR>
<TR> A questionnaire survey of the drugs indicated the need to control both newly prescribed drugs in hospitals and drugs brought by the patients . <TR>
<TR> Nasal and jaw masks were prepared to avoid the oppression of a nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilator ( NIPPV ) on the nasion . <TR>
<TR> The frequency of air leakage and the change in SpO2 were examined when the improved masks were used . <TR>
<TR> The result showed that the improved masks reduced the leakage during sleep and maintained SpO2 at 90 % or higher . <TR>
<TR> The masks should be modified for each disease condition . <TR>
<TR> In 20 general houses of cities in Japan , the pollution investigation of the Indian meal mothos ( Ploidia interpunctella ) was carried out using phermone trap . <TR>
<TR> This species was captured at 89 % inside and 94 % outside the houses . <TR>
<TR> The study revealed the higher possibility of damage for the processed food stored in a house . <TR>
<TR> In outdoor , they were captured from the beginning of May to the middle or the end of October , and it sugested the possibility of invading from the outer circumference . <TR>
<TR> This paper describes disease state and symptoms of primary nephrotic syndrome . <TR>
<TR> Those who suffered from the disease were mostly infants . <TR>
<TR> Regarding diagnostic criteria , proteinuria 3.5 g / day and over , edema in the eyelid and legs , hyperlipidemia , and serum total cholesterol more than 250 mg / 100 ml were accepted . <TR>
<TR> This paper described the following disease types : minute change group , focal sclerosing glomerulopathy , mesangial proliferation nephritis , membraneous proliferative nephropathy , and membranous nephropathy . <TR>
<TR> The above subject was examined for 12 cases that were surgically removed and pathohistologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma . <TR>
<TR> The abnormality of both p53 , and c ‐ erbe ‐ 2 genes was searched in the immunohistologic dyeing by enzyme antibody indirect method or ABC method , and the relationship between the results and prognosis , and prognosticator was examined . <TR>
<TR> The tumor diameter was bigger in both genes expression group than in both genes negative group , and there was a trend of high ratio of the lymph node metastasis . <TR>
<TR> And , there was a trend that recognized increase and necrosis of the nuclear fission image and existence of nerve circumference invasion in both genes expression group . <TR>
<TR> Efficacies of a cerebral metabolism improving drug aniracetum ( AC ) on the cases observed of neurological symptoms during the treatment of Parkinson 's disease ( PK ) and mechanism of the psychiatric symptoms appearing in PK treatment were explained for 5 cases . <TR>
<TR> AC was administered to the cases with hallucination 1 month to 8 years after the beginning of administration of anti ‐ PK drus , however , only 2 cases had continuous improvement of symptoms , resulting in its transient efficacies in many cases . <TR>
<TR> No deterioration of various symptoms like immobility , rigidity and PK movement was observed even if the dose of anti ‐ PK drug was not changed . <TR>
<TR> In addition , diminishing of anti ‐ PK drug at the outbreak of psychiatric symptoms in PK patients was explained . <TR>
<TR> This study examined the cerebral neural transmission mechanism in schizophrenics ( A ) with PET . <TR>
<TR> Reserpine increased the combination of the [ 11C ] raclopride to cerebral D2 dopamine receptors . <TR>
<TR> A with extrapyramidal side effects ( B ) showed high D2 receptor occupancy rate , and B was considered to result from D2 interception in the basal ganglia . <TR>
<TR> The D2 occupancy rate was low in A who received clozapine , and 5 ‐ HT2A receptor occupancy rate was high . <TR>
<TR> For the therapy in accordance with the oriental medical syndromes , two elderly subjects with chronic renal insufficiency were tested by the administrations of the Chinease medicine extract formula , resulted in no reduction of renal functions for 1 year and 1 year and 2 monthes , respectively . <TR>
<TR> In a case of 71 ‐ year ‐ old female patient , she was given Keishi ‐ ninjin ‐ to first , then changed to the combinations of Shinbu ‐ to , Bukuryou ‐ Shigyaku : minus ‐ ninjin ‐ to , Keishi ‐ ninjin : plus Bushi ‐ to , and Bushi ‐ Ricyu ‐ to , and followed by Shigyaku : plus Ren ‐ niku ( Nelumbo nucifera fruit ) ‐ to at present stage . <TR>
<TR> In another case a 72 ‐ year ‐ old male patient , he was given Hachimi ‐ jio ‐ gan powder first , and continueing to take another Chinease medicinal Hochu ‐ ekiki ‐ to afterwards . <TR>
<TR> In both patients , the conscience morbide such as fatigue and anorexia was improved . <TR>
<TR> Effects of fatty acids and dimethyl ‐ β ‐ cyclodextrin ( CD ) addition to acrylic polymer type formulation bases including insulin on the enhancement of their rectum absorption are examined . <TR>
<TR> Eudispert hv7 % gels mixed with various fatty acids show excellent hypoglycemic action among other polymer bases when they are intrarectally administered . <TR>
<TR> The formulation mixed with lauric acid shows remarkable hypoglycemic action , but that with oleic acid which has longer carbon chains shows less hypoglycemic action . <TR>
<TR> The formulation added CD shows a sustained hypoglycemic action , but it doesn ' t exceed the duration of the action of the formulation mixed with lauric acid . <TR>
<TR> Membrane fusion liposomes including dextran ( D ) as a model drug are examined to improve the digestive absorption of bioactive peptides . <TR>
<TR> In theexperiments of permeability of liposomes from the mucous membrane side to the serosal side in the various parts of intestines , free D solution is hardly decreased its concentration at the mucous membrane side . <TR>
<TR> Liposomes including D ( L ) and membrane fusion liposomes including D ( FL ) are , howeve , decreased their levels at the mucous membrane side , and the level of FL has exceeded that of L at the side . <TR>
<TR> The effect of FL on the level of D at the mucous membrane side exceeds that of an absorption promotor , bacitracin . <TR>
<TR> These results indicate that FL can be used as the formulation with absorption specificity in the intestine . <TR>

<TR> This paper describes an idea of optimizing inventories and services and the method . <TR>
<TR> A rational basis is needed to remove excessive inventories and services . <TR>
<TR> It is formed by analyzing and quantifying the purchase decision process of final consumers and reference cases of veteran business men scientifically , making a market mechanism hypothesis , and verifying it quantitatively . <TR>
<TR> In this way , what ill effects may appear is clarified when the inventory of a specific product is reduced or a specific service is stopped . <TR>
<TR> The construction and use of such an original database is desirable . <TR>

<TR> There is no real possibility in the direct substitution for fossil fuels and it is necessary to aim at the utilization with high added values . <TR>
<TR> A more concrete possibility is the process in which hydrogen produced in coal gasification by solar heat is employed as the source of hydrogen for coal liquefaction . <TR>
<TR> It is also reported that in a coal gasification experiment by use of magnetite as the oxidizing agent , solar heat could provide the reaction rate and conversion efficiency enough to sustain the energy production , even in the solid phase reaction . <TR>

<TR> Though the PET image is excellent to take the metabolism image of glucose , with 18F mark 2 ‐ fluoro ‐ 2 ‐ deoxyglucose ( FDG ) , the camera for PET is expensive . <TR>
<TR> The method to take the photograph of 2 beams of gamma ray emitted from the positron emission nuclide by the opposed 2 detector gamma camera for SPECT has not been hitherto applied for clinical use because of the inferiority of the obtaine dimage , but a good FDG image has been obtained by the newly developed opposed gamma camera MULTISPECT II developed by Siemens Co. with its collimater replaced with that for 511keV . <TR>
<TR> The comparison was made with the coincidence type SPECT regarding their advantages . <TR>
<TR> The improvement in the supply system of FDG is desired . <TR>
<TR> The subcritical experiment is a plan which is supposing the continuation of nucleus retention to the last regardless of usefulness for the maintenance of nuclear weapons , and must be thought to show the attitude which is contrary to disarmament effort which NPT ( Treaty on the Non ‐ proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ) or CTBT ( Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ) impose upon nuclear powers in texts and preambles . <TR>
<TR> Therefore , the enforcement increases the distrust of nonalignment countries such as India to the U. S. A. and may destroy the basis of NPT and CTBT . <TR>
<TR> Especially , as the experiment is carried out in underground facilities of 300m deep , verification on the existence of nuclear explosion by radiation measurement from the ground is actually impossible , and there is a limit in the underground inspection . <TR>
<TR> There is no other way but to say that the experiment is a haughty folly to challenge the world opinion in search of the abolishment of nuclear weapons solely and openly . <TR>

Coronavirus in Germany : Ang@@ ela Merkel ur@@ ges people to stay home ' wh@@ en@@ ever possible '
Ang@@ ela Merkel has called for soli@@ darity as Germany enters a " very serious phase " of the pandemic . Germany has again set a new daily case record , as minis@@ ters call for thousands of additional contact trac@@ ers .
German Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Ang@@ ela Merkel on Saturday urged residents to stay at home amid a dram@@ atic increase in the number of coronavirus infections in Germany .
" We have to do everything we can now to ensure that the virus does not spread un@@ control@@ lab@@ ly — every day counts , " Merkel said in her weekly po@@ d@@ cast .
" I ask you to ref@@ rain from any trip that is not really necessary , any celebr@@ ation that is not really necessary . P@@ lease stay at home - where@@ ver you are , wh@@ en@@ ever possible , " she said .
Merkel said that Germany was currently in the mid@@ st of a " very serious phase " of the pandemic , adding that " the number of new infections is increasing by lea@@ ps and b@@ ounds every day . "
" The compar@@ atively rela@@ xed summer is over ; now we are facing difficult months . How winter will be , how our Christmas will be , will be decided in the coming days and weeks . We all decide that through our actions . "
She called on Ger@@ m@@ ans to show soli@@ darity and res@@ tr@@ ain@@ t , as they did in the early phase of the pandemic .
" What brought us so well through the first half year of the pandemic ? " she asked . " It was that we stood together and o@@ be@@ yed the rules out of consid@@ eration and common sense . This is the most effective re@@ med@@ y we currently have against the pandemic and it is more necessary now than ever . "
On Saturday , the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute for disease control said Germany recorded 7,@@ 8@@ 30 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 - hour period , a new record since the pandemic began .
The number of cases was nearly 500 higher than on Friday and more than 1,500 higher than the prior infection peak recorded in March .
Officials say testing capacity has been greatly expanded since the beginning of the pandemic and that is one of the reasons why the country is seeing a sp@@ i@@ ke in infections .
A second wave also appears to be in full sw@@ ing due to a Europe - wide loo@@ sen@@ ing of restrictions over the summer .
Bra@@ un also noted that the country 's coronavirus tracing app was seeing a " ste@@ ep rise " in al@@ er@@ ts to the public .
By Tuesday , the app had sent warnings to the an@@ onym@@ ous contacts of some 10,@@ 8@@ 60 users who had subsequently tested positive for the virus .
The app has been down@@ loaded around 19.@@ 6 million times and experts believe it is being used by around 16 million people .
Bra@@ un also told the regional paper that he is in favor of holding a state ceremony to remember those who have died from COVID - 19 .
He ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ ged that relatives of the dead may have not welcomed comments made by minis@@ ters over the summer that Germany had come through the health crisis relatively un@@ s@@ ca@@ th@@ ed .
" To them , I say that the victims of this pandemic will not be for@@ go@@ t@@ ten under any circumstances . ”
COVID - 19 : What role does blood type play ?
A case of COVID - 19 can be from mild to severe . Some@@ times no symptoms are present . Some@@ times people die . More and more studies suggest that blood types may play an important role by affecting immune responses .
Wh@@ y do some people not notice at all that they have contracted the coronavirus , while others require medical treatment — and , in the worst cases , even die ?
That COVID - 19 seems so un@@ predic@@ table also makes it difficult to find out how many people are actually infected and how many have already built up immunity . The number of un@@ reported cases is correspon@@ dingly high .
Al@@ ready in June , German and Nor@@ we@@ gian researchers analy@@ zed different blood types with reg@@ ards to COVID - 19 . They came up with some inform@@ ative results , which they published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The researchers investigated the role blood type might play in patients with particularly severe forms of the disease .
In the study , the researchers examined 1,@@ 6@@ 10 patients with COVID - 19 respiratory failure in Italy and Spain , where the coronavirus hit particularly hard : Milan , Mon@@ za , Madrid , San S@@ eb@@ as@@ tian , and Bar@@ cel@@ ona . All patients were struggling with particularly severe cases , and some did not survive .
B@@ lood type A means highest risk
A first result : People with blood type A seem to be at a particularly high risk of a severe case of COVID - 19 . In Germany , 43 % of the population has this blood type . In the event of coronavirus infection , these individuals might be two times more likely to need an oxygen supply or resp@@ ir@@ ator than people with blood type O : 41 % of Germany 's population .
B@@ lood type O may be able to consider themselves lucky as things stand . Even though they are not protected against an infection , the study shows they have the lowest risk of coming down with a severe case of the disease .
People with blood type O - ( O negative ) also play a special role as blood donors , as they are considered " uni@@ versal donors " and can help anyone in need of a blood trans@@ fusion .
B@@ lood types B and A@@ B are not as widespread , making up just 11 % and 5 % of the population , respectively . According to the study , the like@@ li@@ hood of a severe COVID - 19 diagnosis for these groups could lie some@@ where between that of people with blood types O or A.
Since then , further studies have been added to confirm the original results . On 14 October , two studies appeared in the journal B@@ lood Ad@@ van@@ ces , which also show less severe symptoms of the disease in people in blood group O@@ . Sim@@ ul@@ tane@@ ously , the Medical University of Gra@@ z indepen@@ d@@ ently reported a series of experim@@ ents , designed to further investigate the phenomenon .
Con@@ sequ@@ ences for treatment
The results of the studies may help in developing various drug treatments . Researchers have used similar appro@@ aches when sear@@ ching for medication to fight other diseases .
In the case of malaria , for example , scientists have established a link between the disease and different blood types . For example , it is now known that people with blood type O very rarely develop severe malaria and are very well - protected against its most severe form .
In the case of other diseases , other blood types protect the human body best . For example , with the bub@@ onic pl@@ ague , people with blood type A showed the mil@@ dest symptoms .
For a long time , COVID - 19 research focused on high - risk patients : Those who have certain pre@@ existing conditions and / or have reached a certain age . S@@ mo@@ kers also came under s@@ cru@@ tiny as a potentially high - risk group . Now , researchers are looking at a different piece in the coronavirus j@@ ig@@ saw pu@@ zz@@ le .
Coronavirus : France 's Macron announ@@ ces cur@@ few for Paris and Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le
French President Emmanu@@ el Macron has announced a late night cur@@ few for residents in Paris , Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le and seven other cities . The government also moved to re@@ in@@ state its COVID - 19 state of health emergency .
French President Emmanu@@ el Macron announced on Wednesday that locals in Paris and eight other cities will have to sti@@ ck to a cur@@ few from 9@@ :00 p.m. until 6@@ :00 a.m.
The restric@@ tion , which will come into force on Saturday and last for at least four weeks , will mean residents will not be able to go to restaurants or private homes during these hours .
Macron said on national television : " We have to act . We need to put a br@@ ake on the spread of the virus . "
In addition to Paris and the region surrounding it , the new measures also targeted the cities of Gre@@ no@@ ble , L@@ il@@ le , Ly@@ on , Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le , Mon@@ t@@ pel@@ lier , Rou@@ en , Saint - E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne and T@@ ou@@ lou@@ se .
" We wo n't be leaving the restaurant after 9@@ :00 p.m. , " Macron said . " We wo n't be part@@ ying with friends because we know that that 's where the contam@@ ination risk is greatest . "
An@@ yone found to be trans@@ g@@ res@@ sing the new rules will face a fine of € 135 ( $ 15@@ 9 ) .
" We are in a wor@@ rying situation , " he continued , while ins@@ isting France had not " lost control " of the virus .
The new measures are inten@@ ded to cur@@ b the spread of the virus in France and get a gri@@ p on a recent surge in new cases .
On Wednesday , health authorities announced more than 9,@@ 100 patients were currently in hospital being treated for COVID - 19 , the highest figure since June 25 , leading some experts to suggest the country 's medical system is on the ver@@ ge of being over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
State of emergency
Sh@@ or@@ tly before the cur@@ few was announced , the French government moved to re@@ in@@ state a public health state of emergency in a bid to cur@@ b an up@@ tic@@ k in coronavirus infections across the country .
The form@@ al declaration was made in a statement by the government , adding that the pandemic was a public health disaster which endang@@ ered the well - being of the entire population .
France was facing " a health cat@@ as@@ tro@@ ph@@ e , " according to minutes from a C@@ abinet meeting that took place on Wednesday .
The state of health emergency is a legal framework allowing the government to take a stric@@ ter line on fighting the spread of infections .
Earlier this year France declared a state of health emergency which exp@@ ired on July 10 .
Coronavirus drugs : Can antibodies from survi@@ vors help ?
Aside from a Covid - 19 vaccine , antibodies from recovered patients could provide a short - term " pas@@ sive immun@@ ization " to the disease . A German immuno@@ logist sa@@ ved thousands of lives with the method 100 years ago .
About 80,000 people worldwide have survi@@ ved a Covid - 19 infection . Their immune systems will have produced antibodies , which will help their bodies recognize and fight a repe@@ at attack by the coronavirus . It 's a natural defense mechan@@ ism .
But while we wait for a vaccine to prevent infection , those antibodies could be used to help those infected .
Those antibodies can be extrac@@ ted from the blood ser@@ um of survi@@ ving patients , and then inj@@ ected into infected people . Those people should then develop a " pas@@ sive immunity . "
Ad@@ van@@ t@@ ages and dis@@ advant@@ ages of ser@@ um therapy
A pas@@ sive immun@@ ization functions like a tre@@ am@@ ent for infected patients , but it does n't provide long - term protection . It 's called pas@@ sive immun@@ ization , because the re@@ ci@@ pi@@ ent body has n't actively produced any antibodies itself . And as a result , the antibodies it " bor@@ ro@@ ws " will provide protection or help to fight an infection , but only for a short period of time .
Pas@@ sive immun@@ ization usually las@@ ts for a few weeks or months , after which those bor@@ ro@@ wed or donated antibodies get broken down by the host body within about 30 days .
The person retur@@ ns to being at risk of infection by the same patho@@ gen , because their own immune system has not been stimul@@ ated to produce its own , more permanent antibodies . Patients who survive a Covid - 19 infection with pas@@ sive immun@@ ization would still be at risk of re-@@ infection , un@@ like patients who had been infected and f@@ ought off the disease with their own immune system actively producing the antibodies .
No@@ bel Pri@@ ze for blood ser@@ um therapy
Pas@@ sive immun@@ ization was first introduced by E@@ mi@@ l v@@ on Be@@ h@@ ring , a German immuno@@ logist and ser@@ o@@ logist , in 18@@ 90 . He developed it for diphtheria , a highly infectious , bacterial disease , responsible for the death of thousands of children back then .
E@@ mi@@ l v@@ on Be@@ h@@ ring was a@@ war@@ ded the first No@@ bel Pri@@ ze for medicine in 19@@ 0@@ 1 . For his succ@@ esses in the development of blood ser@@ um - der@@ i@@ ved medicines against diphtheria and t@@ et@@ an@@ us , v@@ on Be@@ h@@ ring was ha@@ iled by the press as the " sa@@ vi@@ or of children " and during World War I as the " sa@@ vi@@ or of soldiers . "
U@@ sed against Ebola and bird flu
Ser@@ um therapy was used in 2014 at the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa .
Four years later , during another outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo , a drug cons@@ isting of antibodies was used to treat patients and prevented the virus from spreading in the body . That 's said to have reduced the mortality rate by 30 percent .
Researchers now want to use antibodies extrac@@ ted from the blood ser@@ um of recovered coronavirus patients to offer a pas@@ sive immun@@ ization against the new disease .
And the work has be@@ gun .
In Japan , the drug manufacturer T@@ ak@@ eda Pharm@@ ac@@ eutical Co. says it plans to ob@@ tain an anti@@ body mi@@ x@@ ture called T@@ A@@ K - 8@@ 88 from the blood plasma of recovered coronavirus patients and use it to develop a new drug .
T@@ ak@@ eda is also producing a drug called intra@@ ven@@ ous immuno@@ glo@@ bu@@ lin ( I@@ VI@@ G ) for the treatment of patients with immune dis@@ orders . Experts say T@@ ak@@ eda 's approach is promising , as their drug cons@@ ists of various pur@@ i@@ fied antibodies . That means that researchers do not have to spend time and effort identifying the antibodies needed to fight diseases , such as the new coronavirus .
A Califor@@ ni@@ an competi@@ tor , Vi@@ r Pharm@@ ac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , has taken a similar approach . The American bio@@ technology company is testing whether antibodies ob@@ tained in 2003 from the blood ser@@ um of former SARS patients can neu@@ tral@@ ize SARS - CoV - 2 .
SARS and SARS - CoV - 2 ( Covid - 19 ) are both severe acute respiratory syn@@ dro@@ mes , so there could be useful simil@@ ar@@ ities in the antibodies .
Vi@@ r is collabor@@ ating with W@@ u@@ X@@ i Bio@@ logi@@ cs , a company in China , where the new coronavirus was first detected . The 2003 SARS pre@@ domin@@ antly affected southern parts of China .
Do@@ es ser@@ um therapy replace vaccination ?
While drugs to treat patients with Covid - 19 , and vaccines to prevent infection are being developed , a fast - acting , st@@ op@@ ga@@ p ser@@ um therapy could be useful as a first aid for high - risk patients .
High risks groups include older people , around the ages of 70 or 80 , and people with existing , serious conditions , and that may also include younger people .
Experts say an anti@@ body drug could reach a large number of potential patients quickly , because it can be produced quickly in huge cell tan@@ ks .
But it will take a vaccine to slow and eventually stop the transmission of this new coronavirus , and lab@@ s around the world are currently working on that at full speed .
Coronavirus : R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r is no mir@@ acle cure
While R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r reduces the mortality rate and the dur@@ ation of the illness COVID - 19 , it 's no ma@@ gic re@@ med@@ y . Now a pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely lea@@ ked WHO study confirms earlier research results .
So@@ on after the very first cases of coronavirus infections in China , att@@ enti@@ ons turned to R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r as a potential drug to treat the illness . R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r was originally developed to treat Ebola infections , but it also showed effectiveness against SARS and MERS coronaviruses in laboratory tests . The new SARS - CoV - 2 is considered a vari@@ ant of the 2002 SARS patho@@ gen .
The drug was developed by the US pharmaceutical company Gil@@ ead Sciences as G@@ S - 5@@ 7@@ 34 . At the out@@ set of the pandemic , it was not approved by any country .
It has since been used in the context of an Emergency U@@ se Author@@ ization ( E@@ U@@ A ) , as well as in the context of scientific studies in numerous countries . Gil@@ ead Sciences gave the drug the brand name V@@ e@@ k@@ l@@ ury in Au@@ tumn 2020 .
After an initial clinical trial in the US showed positive results in May 2020 , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) granted the E@@ U@@ A . Since then , R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r was able to be used in hospitals for the treatment of individual patients with the lung disease COVID - 19 outside clinical trials .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) published a non-@@ pe@@ er@@ -@@ re@@ viewed pre@@ pr@@ int study on Med@@ R@@ xi@@ v on October 15 , 2020 showing that R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r ba@@ rely reduces the mortality rate of COVID - 19 patients . The study is a result of the so - called ' S@@ O@@ L@@ ID@@ A@@ RI@@ T@@ Y Tri@@ al ' in which the data of 11,@@ 26@@ 6 patients was evalu@@ ated .
Gil@@ ead Sciences in a statement arg@@ ued that by having the study published as a pre@@ pr@@ int , " the data from this open - la@@ bel global trial have not under@@ gone the ri@@ gor@@ ous review required to allow for con@@ struc@@ tive scientific discus@@ sion . "
Gil@@ ead Sciences filed an application for regular approval of the drug with the FDA on August 7 , 2020 . It has not yet been approved .
How does R@@ em@@ dis@@ i@@ vi@@ r work ?
The antiviral effect of R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r der@@ i@@ ves from its function as a so - called nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ de an@@ alo@@ gue . The active substance i@@ nhi@@ b@@ its the R@@ NA poly@@ mer@@ ase ( R@@ d@@ R@@ p ) of viruses such as Ebola and MERS because its structure is similar to R@@ NA building bloc@@ ks . During virus rep@@ lic@@ ation , these are er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously in@@ corpor@@ ated into the genetic s@@ tran@@ ds of the new virus cop@@ ies . Tru@@ ly func@@ tional new viruses can not be created in this way .
Although R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r did not prove to be really effective in fighting Ebola , cell culture experim@@ ents and initial experim@@ ents on m@@ ac@@ a@@ ques showed that it had a promising effect against the coronaviruses SARS and MERS - CoV , which are closely related to SARS - CoV - 2 .
Early clinical trials with R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r carried out in the US and China were inten@@ ded to show if the drug also helps against COVID - 19 .
White House celeb@@ rates positive effects
Initi@@ al positive results of an early r@@ and@@ om@@ ized clinical trial in the US were announced on April 29 , 2020 directly from the White House in Washington DC . Speaking about R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r at a press conference with US President Donald Trump at the White House , the director of the National Institute for Al@@ l@@ ergy and Infectious Diseases ( N@@ I@@ AID ) , Anth@@ ony F@@ au@@ c@@ i , then stated : " This will be the standard of care . "
A total of 1,0@@ 63 patients with var@@ ying degrees of severity of the disease had taken part in the N@@ I@@ AID - fun@@ ded study , the " Ad@@ ap@@ tive COVID - 19 Tre@@ at@@ ment Tri@@ al " ' Ad@@ ap@@ tive COVID - 19 Tre@@ at@@ ment Tri@@ al ' and were treated with R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r or a plac@@ eb@@ o for 10 days .
The results were similar , al@@ be@@ it not quite as clear as those from the new N@@ E@@ J@@ M study . According to N@@ I@@ AID , preliminary results suggested that COVID - 19 patients receiving R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r had , on average , a 31 % faster recovery time than patients given the plac@@ eb@@ o . Patients that received R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r had an average recovery time of 11 days and patients receiving the plac@@ eb@@ o had an average recovery time of 15 days .
The mortality rate in the R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r - treated group was 8 % compared to 11.@@ 6 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Tri@@ als ended pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely
Those responsible for the trials then considered them sufficient . The National Institu@@ tes of Health in the US said that the results were meaning@@ ful enough . At a meeting of the Data Safety Mon@@ it@@ oring Board ( D@@ S@@ M@@ B ) on April 27 , 2020 it was decided to termin@@ ate the study pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely .
In par@@ alle@@ l with the successful reports from Washington , there were additional reports from China , where R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r was first tested for its efficacy in r@@ and@@ om@@ ized clinical trials in Wuhan on patients in intensive care units suffering from severe cases of COVID - 19 .
E@@ ven@@ tually , however , Wuhan l@@ acked the necessary patients because of a sharp decline in new infections , and that study was also termin@@ ated pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely , according to a report in The Lanc@@ et .
What do the results mean ?
Both the early two studies , as well as the more recent published and lea@@ ked studies , seem to point to the same conclu@@ sion : The active substance R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r has cle@@ arly prov@@ en to be moder@@ ately effective . It reduces the death rate slightly but not significantly and it reduces the dur@@ ation of the disease by a few days .
Although this is encouraging , it is far from being the res@@ oun@@ ding success that many had ho@@ ped for from what was described as the most promising drug candidate to date .
" For patients with a severe form of this disease , this study gives hope that they will be able to recover from the infection more quickly and safe@@ ly , " he said . " The y@@ ard@@ sti@@ ck for the effectiveness of potential other drugs will , in the future , be R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r . "
" The results of the large - scale S@@ O@@ L@@ ID@@ A@@ RI@@ T@@ Y study from the WHO with 11,@@ 26@@ 6 patients included worldwide are not entirely unexpected , but no less dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting " C@@ l@@ em@@ ens W@@ end@@ t@@ ner , chief physi@@ cian for infec@@ ti@@ ology and tropical medicine at the Munich M@@ unic@@ ip@@ al Hospital said .
" Despite the li@@ mit@@ ation that no detail@@ ed data are available on the pre@@ pr@@ int ser@@ ver to date and a pe@@ er review process is still pending , it can be stated that the study has failed to meet its primary end@@ point : N@@ one of the four drugs tested — R@@ em@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r , hydroxychloroquine , L@@ opin@@ ar / R@@ it@@ on@@ avir , and I@@ F@@ N - ß@@ 1@@ a - are capable of reducing COVID - 19 mortality in sy@@ mptomatic patients requiring hospital treatment , " said W@@ end@@ t@@ ler about the most recent study .
How Vietnam is winning its ' war ' on coronavirus
A den@@ sely popul@@ ated neighb@@ or of China , Vietnam has a wea@@ k healthcare system and a low budget for comb@@ ating the coronavirus . So how has it managed to keep its COVID - 19 infection rate so low ?
As the coronavirus pandemic r@@ ages in w@@ ealthy European countries , more than 10,000 kilometers ( 6,000 miles ) from China where the outbreak began , Vietnam has widely been sp@@ ared .
In Germany alone , the latest numbers from the Johns Hopkins University show over 13@@ 4,000 people have been infected with the novel coronavirus , officially known as SARS - CoV - 2 , resulting in more than 3,@@ 800 fatalities . Vietnam , which shares a 1,@@ 100 - kilometer - long border with China , however , has only reported 268 infections and no fatalities since the outbreak began in January .
Even if we consider these numbers with a do@@ se of cau@@ tion , one thing is clear : Vietnam has done a good job thus far in fighting the coronavirus .
During the Tet New Year celebrations at the end of January , Vietnam 's government said it was " dec@@ l@@ aring war " on the coronavirus , although the outbreak at that time was still con@@ fined to China . Premi@@ er Nguyen Xuan Phuc said during a meeting of Vietnam 's ru@@ ling Communist Party that it would not be long before the coronavirus reached the country . " F@@ igh@@ ting this epidemic , means fighting the en@@ emy , " said Phuc .
Mob@@ il@@ izing on all fron@@ ts
However , this fight will depen@@ d on a lot of government funding and a st@@ out public health system , which are two things that Vietnam l@@ acks .
Vietnam does not have the capacity to under@@ take a South Korea - style fight against coronavirus , which has so far involved carrying out 3@@ 50,000 tests . The country 's medical system is also limited . Nguyen Thanh Phong , the may@@ or of Ho Chi Minh City , a me@@ tro@@ polis of 8 million people , said that the city 's hospitals have a total of 900 intensive care beds . An epidemic in the city would easily over@@ wh@@ el@@ m this capacity .
For example , on February 12 , Vietnam put an entire town of 10,000 near Hanoi under quarantine for three weeks . At this time , there were only 10 confirmed COVID - 19 cases in the entire country . Authorities also widely and me@@ ti@@ cul@@ ously docu@@ mented anyone who potentially came in contact with the virus .
Western countries like Germany only docu@@ mented those infected and their direct contacts . Vietnam also kept track of second , third and fourth levels of contact to infected persons . All of these people were then placed under succ@@ essi@@ vely stri@@ ng@@ ent levels of movement and contact restrictions .
And from very early on , anyone arriving in Vietnam from a high - risk area would be quarantined for 14 days . All schools and universities have also been closed since the beginning of February .
War r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic
Vietnam is also applying a kind of war r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic in its fight against coronavirus . The premi@@ er has said : " Every business , every citizen , every residential area must be a for@@ tress to prevent the epidemic . "
This has hit a ner@@ ve with many Vietnamese , who are p@@ rou@@ d of their ability to stand together in a crisis and end@@ ure hard@@ ships . The Health Ministry even sp@@ on@@ so@@ red a song on YouTube about proper hand - washing that has gone viral .
Following the rules
Although there are no studies to prove it , the mood on social media and convers@@ ations with Vietnamese indic@@ ate that the majority of the public agre@@ es with the government measures .
They are p@@ rou@@ d that Vietnam is f@@ aring compar@@ atively well in meeting the crisis . The country 's most popular coronavirus fi@@ ghter , vice Premi@@ er Vu Duc Dam , has been celebrated on Facebook as a " national her@@ o . "
There are few people who are bo@@ thered by the fact that this success gives a political advantage to Vietnam 's one - party Communist government , which is accused of violating civil rights . People are also accep@@ ting stric@@ ter control of the media .
The projected economic costs , which will hit Vietnam hard despite the low case numbers , have also been widely accepted by the population .
According to government figures , 3,000 businesses have closed in the first two months of 2020 . To ease the burden , Vietnam 's government has made $ 1.1 billion ( € 1 billion ) available to pu@@ mp liqu@@ idity into the economy . However , fin@@ ance officials expect that tax revenues will dry up because of the crisis . The government is also calling for volunt@@ ary don@@ ations — and people are giving what they can because they believe in their government during this crisis and in the fight against coronavirus .
The immune system 's fight against the coronavirus
A central player in the fight against the novel coronavirus is our immune system . It prot@@ ects us against the inv@@ ad@@ er and can even be hel@@ p@@ ful for its therapy . But sometimes it can turn against us .
How does our immune system re@@ act to the coronavirus ?
The coronavirus is — like any other virus — not much more than a sh@@ ell around genetic material and a few proteins . To rep@@ lic@@ ate , it needs a host in the form of a living cell . Once infected , this cell does what the virus comm@@ ands it to do : cop@@ y information , ass@@ em@@ ble it , release it .
But this does not go un@@ noti@@ ced . Within a few minutes , the body 's immune defense system inter@@ ven@@ es with its in@@ n@@ ate response : Gr@@ anu@@ loc@@ y@@ tes , s@@ ca@@ ve@@ nger cells and k@@ iller cells from the blood and ly@@ m@@ ph@@ atic system stream in to fight the virus . They are supported by numerous plasma proteins that either act as mes@@ sengers or help to destro@@ y the virus .
For many viruses and bacteria , this initial activity of the immune system is already sufficient to fight an intru@@ der . It often happens very quickly and effici@@ ently . We often notice only small signs that the system is working : We have a cold , a fever .
Inter@@ fer@@ ons are a sub@@ group of sign@@ al@@ ing proteins that are normally secre@@ ted by infected cells . SARS - CoV - 1 , which was responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2003 , appears to have sup@@ pres@@ sed the production of one of these inter@@ fer@@ ons and thus at least delayed the attrac@@ tion of immune cells . To what ex@@ tent this is also the case with SARS - CoV - 2 , the name given to the coronavirus behind the current pandemic , is still unclear . However , inter@@ fer@@ ons support the body 's own virus defense and are now being tested as a therapy in clinical trials .
At a certain point , however , the host response is so strong that its effect can be counter@@ produc@@ tive . For example , numerous immune cells can enter our lungs and cause the membran@@ e through which oxygen normally pas@@ ses from the air into the blood to th@@ ick@@ en . The exchange of gases is restricted , and in the worst case , ventilation may be necessary .
Some@@ times the reaction can over@@ sho@@ ot and be directed against healthy cells as well . This could also be the case with the novel coronavirus . So drugs are also being tested that sup@@ press an exc@@ es@@ sive immune reaction and that are already known from the treatment of au@@ to@@ immune diseases . The bal@@ ance between protective and over@@ ly aggres@@ sive immune processes in dealing with the coronavirus is currently a big my@@ st@@ ery . This must now be investigated , says A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f , Director of the Institute of Medical Micro@@ bio@@ logy , Im@@ m@@ un@@ ology and Par@@ as@@ it@@ ology at the University of Bon@@ n .
After a time delay , the acquired immune system finally sets itself in mo@@ tion . It is different for every person and depen@@ ds on what we have experienced and with which patho@@ gens we have come into contact . While T cells help destro@@ y infected cells , B cells form antibodies that can keep the virus in check . In the case of the coronavirus , these are neu@@ tral@@ izing antibodies that b@@ ind to the sp@@ i@@ ke protein of the virus . This is the site of attack of the virus , with which it enters the host , i@@ .@@ e. our human cell . Ne@@ u@@ tral@@ izing antibodies speci@@ fically inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ itate the sp@@ i@@ ke protein . Our immune system re@@ members the antibodies it has produced and is thus prepared for a new infection with the same intru@@ der .
Is there an immunity ? How long does it last ?
The good news is that it is very likely there is an immunity . This is suggested by the pro@@ xim@@ ity to other viruses , epidemio@@ logical data and animal experim@@ ents . Researchers infected four r@@ h@@ es@@ us mon@@ ke@@ ys , a species close to humans , with SARS - CoV - 2 . The mon@@ ke@@ ys showed symptoms of COVID - 19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus , developed neu@@ tral@@ izing antibodies and recovered after a few days . When the recovered animals were re@@ infected with the virus , they no longer developed any symptoms : They were immune .
The bad news : It is not yet known how long the immunity will last . It depen@@ ds on whether a patient has successfully developed neu@@ tral@@ izing antibodies . A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f estimates that the immunity should last at least one year . Within this year , every new contact with the virus acts as a kind of boo@@ ster vaccination , which in turn might pro@@ long the immunity .
" The virus is so new that no@@ body has a reasonable immune response , " says the immuno@@ logist . He believes that lif@@ el@@ ong immunity is un@@ likely . This " pri@@ vi@@ lege " is re@@ served for viruses that remain in the body for a long time and give our immune system a vir@@ tually permanent opportunity to get to know it . Since the coronavirus is an R@@ NA ( and not a DNA ) virus , it can not perman@@ ently set@@ tle in the body , says H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f .
The He@@ id@@ el@@ berg immuno@@ logist Ste@@ f@@ an Me@@ u@@ er predic@@ ts that the novel coronavirus will also mu@@ t@@ ate like all viruses . He as@@ su@@ mes that this could be the case in 10 to 15 years : " At some point , the acquired immunity will no longer be of any use to us because then another coronavirus will return , against which the protection that has now been formed will not help us because the virus has changed in such a way that the antibodies are no longer responsible . And then no vaccination will help either . "
How can we take advantage of the anti@@ body response of the immune system ?
Researchers are already collecting plasma from people who have successfully survi@@ ved an infection with SARS - CoV - 2 and are using it to treat a limited number of patients suffering from COVID - 19 . The underlying prin@@ ci@@ ple : pas@@ sive immun@@ ization . The studies carried out to date have shown positive results , but they have usually been carried out on only a few people .
At best , pas@@ sive immun@@ ization is used only when the patient 's own immune system has already started to work against the virus , says A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f : " The longer you can leave the patients alone with the infection before you protect them with pas@@ sive immun@@ ization , the better . " Only through active immun@@ ization can one be protected in the long term . At the same time , it is difficult to recognize the right point in time .
PCR ( poly@@ mer@@ ase chain reaction ) tests are currently used to find out whether a person is infected with the coronavirus . With the help of PCR , it is not possible to tell whether or not there is re@@ pro@@ du@@ ci@@ ble viral R@@ NA ; it is just a pro@@ of of whether the virus is still present , dead or alive .
A PCR test can not tell us whether our immune system has already inter@@ ven@@ ed , i@@ .@@ e. whether we have had contact with the virus in the past , have formed antibodies and are now protected . Researchers are therefore working on tests that check our blood for the presence of antibodies . They are already in use in Singapore , for example , and are ne@@ aring completion in the USA . With the help of these tests , it would finally be possible to gain an over@@ view of the unclear case numbers . In addition , people who have developed antibodies against the virus could be used at the fore@@ front of health care , for example . An " immunity passport " is even under discus@@ sion .
Is it possible to become infected and / or ill several times with the coronavirus ?
" According to all we know , it is not possible with the same patho@@ gen , " says A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f . It is possible to become infected with other coronaviruses or viruses from the SARS or MERS group if their sp@@ i@@ ke proteins look different . " As far as the current epidemic is concerned , it can be as@@ su@@ med that people who have been through COVID - 19 will not become ill from it for the time being and will not trans@@ mit the virus any further , " he says .
How long before you 're no longer conta@@ gious ?
A study carried out on the first coronavirus patients in Germany showed that no viruses that are capable of rep@@ lic@@ ation can be found from day eight after the onset of symptoms , even though PCR can still detect up to 100,000 gene cop@@ ies per sample . This could change the current quarantine recommendations in the future .
According to the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute , patients can currently be discharged from hospital if they show two negative PCR samples from the throat within 24 hours . If they have had a severe case of the disease , they should remain in domestic isolation for another two weeks . For each dis@@ charge , whether from hospital or home isolation , they should have been symptom - free for at least 48 hours .
Wh@@ y do people re@@ act diffe@@ rently to the virus ?
While some people get off with a mild cold , others are put on ventilators or even die of SARS - Co@@ v - 2 . E@@ spec@@ ially people with pre-@@ existing conditions and older people seem to be worst - affected by the virus . Wh@@ y ? This is the hot@@ test question at the moment .
It will still take a very , very long time to understand the mechan@@ istic , biological basis for why some people are so much more severely affected than others , vi@@ ro@@ logist Ang@@ ela R@@ as@@ mus@@ sen told The Scienti@@ st . " The virus is important , but the host response is at least as important , if not more important , " her collea@@ gue St@@ an@@ ley Per@@ l@@ man told the magazine .
Ste@@ f@@ an Me@@ u@@ er sees a fun@@ dam@@ ental survi@@ val prin@@ ci@@ ple of nature in the different equipment and activity of our immune systems : " If we were all the same , one and the same virus could wi@@ pe out the entire human species at once . Due to the genetic range , it is quite normal that some people die from a viral disease while others do not even notice it . "
A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f also suspects immun@@ ological vari@@ ants that could be genetically determined . Since inter@@ sti@@ tial pneumonia is observed with the coronavirus , the focus is probably on an over@@ reaction of the immune system . However , it is also possible that each person affected may have been loaded with a different do@@ se of the virus , which in turn leads to different out@@ comes . And finally , it makes a difference how ro@@ b@@ ust the body and lungs are : Com@@ peti@@ tive ath@@ let@@ es simply have more lung volume than long - time smo@@ kers .
Coronavirus : How Japan keep@@ s COVID - 19 under control
Despite its pro@@ xim@@ ity to China , Japan has n't seen the massive outbreak of the coronavirus that has shut down much of Europe and North America . What are the Japanese doing diffe@@ rently to help slow the spread ?
Coronavirus concerns were n't on the mind of the many people enjo@@ ying Japan 's fam@@ ed ch@@ er@@ ry b@@ los@@ s@@ oms this past weekend . Th@@ ous@@ ands of people s@@ at under the pink s@@ pl@@ end@@ or in parks and along a@@ venues , eating their p@@ acked l@@ un@@ ches , drinking beer and sn@@ apping sel@@ f@@ ies with the bud@@ ding b@@ los@@ s@@ oms .
" Han@@ am@@ i , the flower show , is the most important event of the year for us Japanese , " said an employee at U@@ en@@ o Park in Tokyo .
The contr@@ ast to Europe could har@@ dly be greater . Japan so far has 10 outbreak clusters , with close to 1,@@ 200 confirmed cases and 43 deaths to the coronavirus as of March 24 . Only a few dozen new infections are reported every day . These figures should have explo@@ ded — after all , Japan is very den@@ sely popul@@ ated , with the world 's highest den@@ sity of senior citizens . And it 's in close contact with nearby China , where the disease originated : in January , some 9@@ 25,000 Chinese people traveled t to Japan , while another 8@@ 9,000 made the trip in February .
Respon@@ ding to the coronavirus pandemic , the Japanese government closed all schools two weeks before the spring holidays at the end of March and canceled all public events . But shops and restaurants could remain open , and few Japanese employees decided to work from home .
Con@@ tain@@ ing the spread
The low numbers of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in Japan initially ar@@ ou@@ sed suspic@@ ion that the government was covering up the tru@@ th .
" After the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hi@@ ma nuclear disaster , the government initially refused to ad@@ mit the re@@ actor mel@@ t@@ downs , " said Bar@@ bar@@ a Hol@@ thus , a soci@@ o@@ logist with the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo . " Today , there remains a great dis@@ trust of official stat@@ ements . "
Despite having the capacity to make 6,000 diagno@@ stic tests per day , Japan has only tested around 14@@ ,000 sw@@ ab@@ s to date — 20 times fewer than neighboring South Korea , which has been hit hard by the pandemic . Only patients with the most severe symptoms are tested , said Mas@@ a@@ hi@@ ro K@@ am@@ i , a vi@@ ro@@ logist at the Medical Govern@@ ance Research Institute . That , he added , means the number of un@@ reported cases is very high .
Poli@@ tical scientist Ko@@ i@@ chi N@@ ak@@ ano said Prime Minister Shin@@ zo Abe likely wanted to present Japan as a safe country in order not to lose the Summer Olympics
Experts at the Health Ministry have repeatedly rejected such critic@@ ism , saying they were looking for sp@@ ik@@ es in COVID - 19 cases in order to contain the virus , rather than conduc@@ ting widespread tests . When the epidemic broke out in a primary school on the northern island of Ho@@ k@@ ka@@ id@@ o , for example , authorities closed all schools in the pre@@ f@@ ecture and declared a state of emergency . After three weeks the spread of the virus had been stopped .
" The low number of tests was inten@@ ded to ensure that health care resources remained available for serious cases of infection , " S@@ eb@@ as@@ tian Mas@@ low , a German political scientist at the University of Tokyo , told D@@ W .
Mas@@ ks ' a part of our every@@ day lives '
Japanese gre@@ eting e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette — a bo@@ w instead of a hand@@ sha@@ ke or a k@@ is@@ s on the che@@ ek — has also played a part in s@@ lowing the outbreak , as has basic hygiene education t@@ au@@ ght from an early age .
" W@@ ash@@ ing our hands , g@@ arg@@ ling with a disinfec@@ tant solution and wearing masks are part of our every@@ day lives . We do n't need coronavirus to t@@ each us that , " said a Japanese mother of two . As a result , it was easy for society to s@@ witch to anti-@@ infection mo@@ de in February when the virus first began to spread . Sho@@ ps and businesses set up hand sanitiz@@ ers at the entrance , and it became a civi@@ c duty to wear a face mask .
The country typically goes through 5.5 billion face masks every year — 43 per person . Sal@@ es of face masks sky@@ ro@@ ck@@ eted as the virus took hold . Mas@@ ks have been r@@ ation@@ ed , and people stand pati@@ ently in line waiting for shops to open . Other shops sell stri@@ ps of fab@@ ric and coffee fil@@ ters , along with instructions for D@@ I@@ Y ver@@ sions .
The Japanese appear to have under@@ stood that a person can be infected without showing symptoms , said Michael Pa@@ um@@ en , a German business manager who has lived in Japan for many years : " You put the mask on to protect others , so you yourself do n't trans@@ mit viruses . "
The widespread use of face masks appears to have slow@@ ed down the spread of not just COVID - 19 , as indicated by the sharp drop in the number of flu patients in the seven weeks since the outbreak of the coronavirus . A recent study by five Western physi@@ ci@@ ans , including F@@ ab@@ ian S@@ var@@ a from the Ca@@ es@@ ar research group in Bon@@ n and Mat@@ thi@@ as Sam@@ wal@@ d from the Medical University in Vienna , found that masks " decrease the transmission of dro@@ pl@@ ets or aero@@ s@@ ols containing viral parti@@ cles by mask wea@@ re@@ rs . "
Apart from social distancing and hand - washing , the experts concluded that face masks could play an important role in s@@ lowing down the spread of the virus , poin@@ ting out the low infection rates in Japan .
S@@ low return to normal
In view of this success , Abe last week ref@@ ra@@ ined from dec@@ l@@ aring a national state of emergency . Since then , the Japanese have slow@@ ly been returning to their every@@ day lives . Tu@@ tor@@ ing schools are back in operation , with the children sitting apart from each other in well - venti@@ l@@ ated rooms . Am@@ us@@ ement parks have reopened , but people running a fever are asked to stay away .
F@@ earing a second wave of infections , the government has said that , for the time being , only schools in areas without COVID - 19 patients will be allowed to open at the beginning of the new school sem@@ ester in April . A ban remains prohi@@ bi@@ ting large public events .
Foreign visitors , however , remain a threat according to health authorities , with South Kore@@ ans and EU citizens bar@@ red from entering the country . Fore@@ igners who live in Japan are allowed to return but must remain in quarantine for 14 days upon arrival . According to un@@ official information , the measures will remain in place until at least the end of April .
Vietnam records first Covid - 19 deaths
Vietnam has recorded its first Covid - 19 fatalities , in a dev@@ as@@ t@@ ating b@@ low for a country p@@ rou@@ d of its zero deaths .
The first man , who was aged 70 , was from the central city of Hoi An , state media said on Friday .
A second death , of a 61 - year - old man , was reported later in the day .
There had been no new locally transmitted infections for more than three months , before an outbreak was reported in the nearby resort of Da Nang earlier this week .
Both of the patients who died had underlying health conditions , according to Vietnamese media .
The country , which has a population of around 95 million , has reported just 5@@ 46 cases since the pandemic began .
Un@@ like many other countries , Vietnam acted before it even had confirmed cases , closing its borders early to almost all travelers , except returning citizens . An@@ yone entering the country must quarantine in government facilities for 14 days and undergo testing .
And for a while , with no new local trans@@ missions reported since mid-@@ April .
The country received p@@ raise for both its time@@ ly efforts to contain the virus and for the care it was able to offer .
But earlier this week came the difficult news that new cases had been discovered in the popular resort of Da Nang .
T@@ ens of thousands of tourists from across the country were in the city at the time , many of whom believed the threat from coronavirus had passed .
The government initially closed the city to visitors , before or@@ dering a total local lockdown on Wednesday .
Earlier this week , Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned that every province and city in the country following the outbreak in Da Nang .
" We have to act more s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly and more fi@@ erc@@ ely in order to control the outbreak , " state media quoted him as saying .
Coronavirus Vietnam : The mysterious resur@@ gence of Covid - 19
In mid-@@ July , Vietnam still sh@@ one as a Covid - 19 out@@ lier . No reported deaths , and months without a locally transmitted case .
F@@ ans p@@ acked into football stadi@@ ums , schools had reopened , and customers returned to their fav@@ our@@ ite caf@@ es .
" We were already back to normal life , " said Mai Xuan Tu , a 27 - year - old from Da Nang in central Vietnam .
Like many in the coastal city wil@@ dly popular with domestic visitors , she works in the tourism industry and was slow@@ ly re@@ sum@@ ing boo@@ kings for the tour company she founded .
But by the end of July , Da Nang was the epic@@ en@@ tre of a new coronavirus outbreak , the source of which has st@@ um@@ ped scientists . Cases sud@@ denly sur@@ ged after 99 stra@@ ight days with no local trans@@ missions . Last week the city saw the country 's first Covid - 19 death , a toll that has since risen to 10 .
Su@@ cc@@ ess@@ ful response
Just weeks earlier , Vietnam was praised globally as a rare pandemic success story .
The country acted fast and decis@@ i@@ vely where other nations fal@@ tered , closing its borders to almost all travellers except returning citizens as early as March .
It quarantined and tested anyone who entered the country in government facilities , and conducted widespread contact - tracing and testing nationwide .
So what went wrong ?
" I '@@ m not sure anything went wrong , " says Pr@@ of Michael To@@ ol@@ e , an epidemio@@ logist and prin@@ cip@@ al research f@@ ellow at the Bur@@ net Institute in Melbourne .
Most countries that thought they had the pandemic under control have seen resur@@ gen@@ ces , he says , poin@@ ting to a long list including Spain , Australia and Hong Kong .
Around 80,000 visitors in Danang - many of whom had rela@@ xed into thinking the disease was contained - were flown home promp@@ tly after the new cases emerged , as the historic port city se@@ aled itself off from visitors and re@@ treated into full lockdown .
Vietnam 's sp@@ i@@ ke shows that " once there 's a little cr@@ ack and the virus gets in it can just spread so quickly , " Pr@@ of To@@ ol@@ e says .
Scientists and researchers across the country are rac@@ ing to find out exactly how it did .
In Hanoi Pr@@ of Ro@@ gi@@ er van Do@@ or@@ n , director of the Oxford University Clin@@ ical Research Un@@ it , says the source of this latest outbreak remains a " big my@@ st@@ ery " .
His team works with the government on its infectious diseases program@@ mes and some of them focus on what he calls " genetic det@@ ective work " - the sequ@@ encing of viruses that can help il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate " the chains of transmission . Wh@@ o or where the virus came from " .
But so far no - one knows how the first new case in Da Nang - a 57 - year - old man known as patient 4@@ 16 - came into contact with the coronavirus .
National pri@@ de
A more likely possibility , say researchers , is that the virus went un@@ detected during the months where there were no reported cases , potentially being asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atically transmitted in the community . O@@ r there could have been an er@@ ror some@@ where along the quarantine process with someone released pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely .
" There 's evidence that the virus was circul@@ ating in Da Nang for several weeks before that first case was diagnosed , " says Dr Justin B@@ eard@@ sley , a senior l@@ ec@@ ture@@ r in infectious diseases at the University of Sydney whose research has focused on Vietnam .
There could be some el@@ ement of people dropping their guard , he adds , while no@@ ting that Vietnam showed excep@@ tionally strong community eng@@ agement when it came to cur@@ bing spread of the virus .
" There was big national pri@@ de about controlling the pandemic . And I think that 's been missing in some Western countries . "
Since ho@@ ver@@ ing around the 400 mark in late July , the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Vietnam has sur@@ ged above 7@@ 80 . The deputy health minister has said they expect numbers to rise and forecast on Wednesday that the epidemic will reach a peak in 10 days .
With the recent tourists to Da Nang now back at home , cases have been detected in a total of 14 cities and provinces including the capital and Ho Chi Minh City .
But it has been reas@@ sur@@ ing , says Pr@@ of Van Do@@ or@@ n , that all new cases in other parts of the country so far have had a direct link to the Da Nang outbreak . Cru@@ ci@@ ally , there has been no reported community transmission outside of the city and bor@@ dering province . This is something authorities will be monitoring closely .
" What was successful before is being done again . I '@@ m again impres@@ sed , " he adds .
' The year we look after our health '
Spec@@ k@@ led among the p@@ raise sho@@ wered on Vietnam for its handling of Covid - 19 were some questions about the accuracy of the author@@ it@@ arian state 's data , which medical and diplomatic communities had widely agreed was reliable .
" The new deaths reported shows that there is transpa@@ ren@@ cy in reporting Covid - 19 in Vietnam and that previous ' no deaths ' should have not been questi@@ oned in the first place , " Dr Huong Le Thu , a senior analy@@ st at the Australian Str@@ ate@@ gic Policy Institute , tells the BBC .
All the fatalities so far have been older patients with co-@@ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties .
In Da Nang residents are read@@ jus@@ ting . The beaches and streets are vir@@ tually empty once again as people only leave home to buy food . All eat@@ eries have been closed , including for tak@@ e@@ out and deli@@ ver@@ ies . F@@ lights are gr@@ ounded .
E@@ ach resident is set to be tested for the virus , and a field hospital has been e@@ rec@@ ted as every res@@ our@@ ce is thro@@ wn at s@@ lowing the spread of the disease .
Fre@@ ed@@ oms mostly remain int@@ act in other parts of the country , though Hanoi has closed down bars and karaoke parl@@ ours as an extra precau@@ tion , and several cities including the capital and Ho Chi Minh City have made face masks compu@@ l@@ s@@ ory again in public places .
Like many worldwide , Xuan Tu is rol@@ ling with the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty triggered by the pandemic .
" This year is now the year we look after our health . Fo@@ cus on family . The things that are most important , " she says .
Covid - 19 : Italy tigh@@ tens rules after coronavirus cases surge
Italy has announced a new ra@@ ft of measures to tigh@@ ten restrictions amid a surge in coronavirus cases .
A mask - wearing PM Gi@@ us@@ e@@ pp@@ e Conte said the measures were needed " to avoid a new lockdown " .
May@@ ors will get powers to close public areas after 2@@ 1@@ :00 and the opening times of restaurants and the size of groups allowed will tigh@@ ten .
The moves came as Italy recorded its highest daily infection rate for the second day in a row .
Another 11,@@ 7@@ 0@@ 5 new cases were announced on Sunday , be@@ ating the previous record , which came a day earlier on Saturday , of 10,@@ 9@@ 25 .
Italy was the European nation hardest hit at the start of the pandemic . It has now recorded 4@@ 14@@ ,000 confirmed coronavirus cases . Its 3@@ 6,@@ 500 deaths place it second to only the UK in Europe .
What did Mr Conte say ?
The prime minister said in a tel@@ evi@@ sed address on Sunday evening : " We can not waste time , we must put in place measures to avoid a gener@@ al@@ ised lockdown , which could severely com@@ promis@@ e the economy .
" The government is here but everyone has to do their part . "
He added : " The most effective measures remain the basic precau@@ tions : mask , distance and hand hygiene . We must pay attention to situations where we let our guard down - with relatives and friends . In these situations , the maximum precau@@ tion is required . "
How is Europe co@@ ping with a surge in cases ?
A number of nations have strength@@ ened their approach to coronavirus as the so - called " second wave " of infections continues to increase .
France saw a record number of new cases on Saturday at 3@@ 2,@@ 4@@ 27 and there was close to another 30,000 on Sunday .
However , the rise in confirmed cases in Europe has to be set against the v@@ as@@ tly increased testing that is now taking place compared to the first big wave back in March .
N@@ ine major French cities , including the capital Paris , are under a 2@@ 1@@ :00 to 0@@ 6@@ :00 cur@@ few for at least a month . An@@ yone out then must have a val@@ id reason or could be fined € 135 .
Switzerland on Sunday re@@ acted to a sharp increase in infections by making the wearing of face - c@@ over@@ ings in in@@ door public spaces compu@@ l@@ s@@ ory from Monday . Ga@@ ther@@ ings of more than 15 people in public are also banned .
The Czech Republic said on Sunday it would wait two weeks before dec@@ iding on whether a full lockdown was needed . The country currently has the highest coronavirus infection rate in Europe and has closed most of the hospit@@ ality sector and moved schools to distance - learning .
Ireland is set to announ@@ ce ti@@ ghter restrictions on Monday . A minister said a loc@@ al@@ ised policy had not been sufficient and imp@@ lied the c@@ abinet was looking at a " level four " approach that would close all non-essential businesses .
Germany hit a daily record of new infections on Saturday and Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Ang@@ ela Merkel urged people to stay at home and avoid travel where possible .
In the Netherlands , PM Mar@@ k Ru@@ t@@ te admitted he should have given better advice to the royal family after they cut short a trip to Greece amid public anger that they were holi@@ day@@ ing shortly after the government had introduced a parti@@ al lockdown .
Wh@@ ere have Vietnamese traveled during the COVID - 19 pandemic ?
Vietnamese people traveled an average of 6@@ 29 km per boo@@ king in 2020 .
Since the COVID - 19 pandemic has forced the country to shut@@ ter its borders , Vietnamese holi@@ day@@ makers have had to ad@@ just their 2020 i@@ tin@@ er@@ aries , shi@@ f@@ ting their plan from overseas visits to domestic destinations .
A recent survey by boo@@ king@@ .@@ com showed the average travel distance traveled by Vietnamese travelers per boo@@ king was 6@@ 29 km in 2020 , 30@@ 3 km less than the same period last year .
The survey also showed Vietnamese people are fav@@ oring big cities and well - known destinations , with Ho Chi Minh City , Ha Noi , Vung Tau , Da Nang , and Da Lat am@@ ong@@ st the top travel hot@@ spots in June to August .
Anth@@ ony L@@ u , regional director for boo@@ king@@ .@@ com in Vietnam , said Vietnamese people are still busy traveling despite the un@@ predic@@ table pandemic .
“ Sh@@ or@@ tly after Vietnam started easing travel restrictions , we found that Vietnamese people , as well as foreigners living in Vietnam , were ea@@ ger to travel , ” L@@ u said .
Ho Chi Minh City
Ho Chi Minh City is known as Vietnam ’s trade and financial hub .
With a modern and vi@@ br@@ ant urban life , the city en@@ thr@@ alls visitors with the es@@ the@@ tic char@@ m of its historical archit@@ ecture and arti@@ stic c@@ it@@ y@@ scap@@ e .
Its col@@ or@@ ful night eat@@ eries and night@@ life venues mean there is always something new and ex@@ citing to see .
Tra@@ v@@ el@@ ers visiting the city are often aw@@ ed by its street e@@ ats and wide range of aff@@ ord@@ able restaurants for din@@ ers of all ages .
Hanoi
Apart from w@@ and@@ ering around the Old Qu@@ ar@@ ter , visitors to Hanoi can enjoy the city ’s dozens of historical land@@ marks , including the Hanoi C@@ er@@ am@@ ic Mo@@ sa@@ ic M@@ ural , also known as Hanoi ’s C@@ er@@ am@@ ic Ro@@ ad .
The 3.@@ 85 km road running alongside the Red River was recognized in the Gu@@ in@@ ness B@@ ook of World Rec@@ or@@ ds as the ‘ world 's largest cer@@ am@@ ic mo@@ sa@@ ic ’ in 2010 .
For those looking for a qu@@ i@@ et place to rela@@ x , West Lake ’s sign@@ ature caf@@ é@@ s offer a peac@@ eful atmosphere with great drinks and sn@@ acks .
Vung Tau
Vung Tau is a popular weekend get@@ away for Saig@@ on@@ ese looking to escape the hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of daily life .
This coastal city is just 90 minutes by bus from the southern me@@ tro@@ polis .
Although being famous for its beaches and seafood , Vung Tau has other ' hi@@ d@@ den g@@ ems ' such as its ligh@@ th@@ ouse and the Robert Taylor Museum of Wor@@ ldwide Ar@@ ms .
Da Nang
Da Nang offers a fas@@ cin@@ ating vac@@ ation destination filled with many ic@@ onic sites like the 6@@ 7@@ m - high Lady Buddha stat@@ ue at Linh U@@ ng pag@@ o@@ da , known for being the tal@@ l@@ est Buddha stat@@ ue in Vietnam .
Tra@@ v@@ el@@ ers may also embar@@ k on a lux@@ ur@@ ious railway ad@@ venture abo@@ ard The Viet@@ age , a railway line that links the ancient town of Hoi An with the sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ling sho@@ res of Quy Nh@@ on .
Da Lat
This mes@@ mer@@ izing city is not only famous for its s@@ pl@@ en@@ did French - style vill@@ as but also other mon@@ um@@ ents and leisure activities .
The cool weather is what makes this Central Highlands city fit for tea farming , perfect for those lo@@ ving to try making their own mat@@ cha drink .
Qu@@ ar@@ antin@@ e issues hin@@ der Vietnam from operating regular in@@ bound flights
Pas@@ sengers arrive on a commercial flight from South Korea at Tan Son Nhat Airport in Ho Chi Minh City in this photo taken in September 2020 .
Dom@@ estic airlines have once again suspended in@@ bound services , shortly after the resu@@ mption in late September
Dom@@ estic airlines have once again suspended in@@ bound services , shortly after the resu@@ mption of two commercial flights between South Korea and Vietnam in late September .
The suspension is the result of in@@ consistent management and quarantine proto@@ col@@ s for in@@ bound flight passengers , the Ministry of Transport said .
Fur@@ ther guidelines from relevant agencies are needed to rest@@ ore the flights , the ministry added .
Qu@@ ar@@ antin@@ e price disputes
Since the country closed its borders since March to prevent the spread of COVID - 19 , Vietnam has still received a hand@@ ful of in@@ bound flights under three categories - rescue flights , exclu@@ sive flights for foreign experts , or commercial flights .
To board rescue flights , passengers must sign up at Vietnamese emb@@ as@@ si@@ es overseas and wait for approval .
Meanwhile , flights for experts and commercial flights do not set any requirements for passengers .
Phan Thanh Tam , deputy director of the Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control , said all en@@ tran@@ ts into Vietnam are subject to a charg@@ ea@@ ble quarantine period , exclu@@ ding those on rescue flights .
The recent arrival of 262 passengers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City from South Korea marked the resu@@ mption of regular commercial flights to Vietnam after previous suspension , a leader of a domestic airline said .
However , the in@@ cons@@ isten@@ cies in quarantine fees at hotels met with a back@@ las@@ h from passengers , he added .
The Southern Air@@ ports Corporation , which manag@@ es Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City , reported that there were passengers deli@@ ber@@ ately pic@@ king a quar@@ rel to avoid hotel quarantine in an effort to enter coll@@ ective quarantine centers , where the 14 - day quarantine service is offered at a much lower price .
Meanwhile , some Vietnam Airlines passengers on September 25 said that they had bought tickets and transferred money for hotel quarantine . However , they were sent to military bas@@ es upon arrival at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi , with their de@@ pos@@ its returned by the hotels .
Pas@@ sengers of budget carrier Viet@@ J@@ et said they should have been quarantined at the hotels in Ho Chi Minh City that they had paid for , but they were sent to centralized isolation in out@@ lying Can Gi@@ o District instead .
During his stay in Can Gi@@ o after leaving South Korea for Ho Chi Minh City on September 30 , passenger N. T@@ . D. said he had not received transpa@@ rent information on hotel quarantine fees before buying flight tickets .
Ar@@ ri@@ ving in Ho Chi Minh City , he found hotel charges flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating rapidly and ending up un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able to many people .
“ Not everyone can aff@@ ord a stay in a hotel at VND 1.3 million [ $ 56 ] per day , even up to VND 1.@@ 7 million [ $ 7@@ 3.3 ] per day in 14 days in a row [ for the required quarantine period ] , ” he el@@ abor@@ ated .
Air@@ line - hotel cooperation
While the quarantine proto@@ col@@ s for flight passengers remain under consid@@ eration , accommodation and quarantine fees are attribu@@ ted the recent dis@@ ruption of international flights .
Many passengers said they could not pay for quarantine fees at high - end hotels in the country .
Nguyen Thi Anh Hoa , deputy director of the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Tourism , said hotels chosen for quarantine services will have to post their rates publicly .
En@@ tran@@ ts into Vietnam are required to present their quarantine plan , including destinations , quarantine facilities , means of transport , and hotel boo@@ kings .
To avoid ar@@ ising problems , Vietnam Airlines pro@@ poses a partnership between its cer@@ ti@@ fied flight ticket agencies and lo@@ d@@ ging facilities to ar@@ range quarantine tour packages with various options in flight and hotel services .
This will ensure proper quarantine for passengers upon their arrival in Vietnam .
In another note , a working group from the Ministry of Health is developing a uni@@ fied quarantine protocol on a nationwide scale , which will be submitted to the National Steering Committee for COVID - 19 Prevention and Control for approval .
Anti@@ -@@ lock@@ dow@@ ners protest as London COVID alert level is raised
Anti@@ -@@ lockdown demonstr@@ ators gathered in central London on Saturday , hours after the British capital moved to the second highest COVID - 19 alert level .
As a second wave of infections ga@@ thers p@@ ace , Prime Minister Bor@@ is Johnson ’s government has ste@@ pped up local restrictions in parts of England where cases are sur@@ ging - hoping to shi@@ eld the economy by allowing the least - affected regions to remain open .
As of midnight , London was moved up to the “ ti@@ er 2 ” or “ high - risk ” level . This bans people from meeting any@@ body outside their household or “ support bubble ” - including friends or relatives who help to care for children - in any in@@ door setting .

Vietnam canc@@ els 2020 F@@ 1 race due to COVID - 19 pandemic
A man w@@ ears a protective mask as he guards at the construction site of Form@@ ula One Vietnam Grand Pri@@ x rac@@ ing track in Hanoi , Vietnam March 12 , 2020 .
Vietnam ’s first Form@@ ula One gr@@ and pri@@ x has been officially cancelled due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , organis@@ ers said on Friday .
The Vietnamese Grand Pri@@ x was originally scheduled to take place in April on the streets of Hanoi as the third race of the season , but sources told Reuters in March that it was under threat .
“ This has been an extremely difficult but necessary decision to reach in view of the continued un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty caused by the global coronavirus pandemic , ” Vietnam Grand Pri@@ x Cor@@ p said in an em@@ ailed statement , adding that it would re@@ fund all tickets sold .
Vietnam has recorded over 1,@@ 110 COVID - 19 infections , with 35 deaths , Ministry of Health data showed .
The start of the Form@@ ula One season was pushed back to July from March due to the pandemic , with exten@@ sive changes made to the 2020 cal@@ end@@ ar .
The total number of rac@@ es was cut to 17 from the record 22 originally en@@ vi@@ sa@@ ged , with Vietnam becoming the 13@@ th race from the original cal@@ end@@ ar to be ax@@ ed this year .
Hanoi city authorities had ho@@ ped to hold the race in November , but Vietnam Grand Pri@@ x Cor@@ p Chief Ex@@ ecu@@ tive Le Ngoc Chi said on Friday that cancellation emerged as the only option after a review of safety c@@ rit@@ eria .
Form@@ ula One only fin@@ al@@ ised its 2020 cal@@ end@@ ar in August , following six r@@ ounds of rac@@ ing .
The 13 rac@@ es announced before the final cal@@ end@@ ar was made public were all in Europe , after all four of the season ’s rac@@ es in the Americ@@ as were scr@@ apped .
In its August announcement , Form@@ ula One cancelled the Chinese Grand Pri@@ x , while adding four more rac@@ es - one in Turkey , two in Bah@@ rain and one in Ab@@ u Dha@@ bi - in the last two months of the year .
Vietnamese universities short of international students amid COVID - 19 pandemic
Some international students , among more than 150 ones , take part in the Global Lea@@ der Exper@@ i@@ ence held in 2019 by R@@ M@@ IT University Vietnam .
Many Vietnamese universities are struggling against the falling number of international students because of travel restrictions amid the novel coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic .
N@@ orm@@ ally , local universities ad@@ mit up to thousands of foreign students each year , who come to Vietnam to take various education programs .
They are po@@ ised to create an ide@@ al overseas study destination in competition with regional universities , but have recently en@@ coun@@ tered a he@@ f@@ ty obst@@ acle – COVID - 19 .
Every year , the fac@@ ul@@ ty of Vietnamese studies of the University of Social Sciences and Hum@@ an@@ ities , Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City , recei@@ ves thousands of international students who learn about the Vietnamese language and culture .
According to As@@ so@@ c@@ . P@@ ro . Dr. Do@@ an Le Giang , head of the fac@@ ul@@ ty , although this year 's new sem@@ ester has started , around 50 percent of full - time students , including so@@ ph@@ om@@ ore@@ s and j@@ uni@@ ors , have not come back .
They are mainly South Kore@@ ans , who returned home in February or March when the epidemic developed complic@@ atedly in Southeast Asia .
Stu@@ dent numbers tum@@ ble
In the new school year of 2020 - 21 , only about 45 new international students were admitted to the fac@@ ul@@ ty of Vietnamese studies , dropping nearly a half in compar@@ ison with last year 's number .
Most of the fresh@@ men are residing with their families in Vietnam while there are few students from other regional countries .
The pandemic has affected not only full - time students but also those parti@@ ci@@ pating in the 2 +@@ 2 program , which means two years in Vietnam and two years in their home countries .
" They could n’t come to Vietnam for the second sem@@ ester last year and the situation remains un@@ changed in this year 's first sem@@ ester , " said Dr. Giang .
The number of exchange students , who often register for a short course from two to three weeks , has also declined sharply , which is quite different from previous years .
Dr. Nguyen Trung Hien , head of student aff@@ airs under the fac@@ ul@@ ty of international studies of the Vietnam National University - Hanoi , told Tuoi Tre ( You@@ th ) newspaper it is very difficult to attract international students .
There have been only seven fresh@@ men up to now , Dr. Hien said .
" Although Vietnam has brought the pandemic under control , many international flights have not been resu@@ med , " he added .
" As a result , many overseas students keep a w@@ ary eye on traveling to Vietnam for this sem@@ ester . Some of them are not as exc@@ ited as before . ”
Dr. Hien 's university received more than 100 students from the U. S. and Canada via student exchange programs last year . The programs , however , have been canceled this year , including study tours and summer schools .
A few international students have met trouble in visa exten@@ sion , according to Dr. Hien .
In such cases , the university has helped them with entry / ex@@ it form@@ alities as requested .
F@@ lying students home on charter flights
In 2019 , FPT University admitted about 1,000 international students , mainly via student exchange programs , mostly from Japan , Australia , Malaysia , and Taiwan .
According to Dr. Le Truong Tung , chairman of the FPT University Council , all activities of international training collaboration have come to a stand@@ still this year because of the pandemic .
At the beginning of this year , the pandemic broke out when many international students were parti@@ ci@@ pating in student exchange programs at the university .
At the same time , many Vietnamese students were taking part in similar programs in Japan and Malaysia .
As the pandemic could li@@ nger for a long time , the university discussed with its partners and decided to let students return home earlier than expected .
The universities were responsible for the preparation and expen@@ ses in bringing students home .
The university char@@ tered a flight to send nearly 100 students and l@@ ec@@ ture@@ rs back to Vietnam from Japan in April , before the restrictions of international flights took effect .
The situation of R@@ M@@ IT Vietnam University , however , did not go as sm@@ oo@@ thly as FPT University .
Many of R@@ M@@ IT 's students and l@@ ec@@ ture@@ rs were s@@ tranded in Australia for months since the coronavirus outbreak .
It took the university a lot of time to organiz@@ e a flight carrying 270 students and l@@ ec@@ ture@@ rs from Melbourne to Vietnam , Prof@@ . Peter Co@@ lo@@ e , chairman of R@@ M@@ IT Vietnam , told Tuoi Tre .
All the passengers had tested negative for the coronavirus from 3 - 7 days before boar@@ ding .
After landing at Van Don Airport in the northern Vietnamese province of Quang Ninh , they were sent to a central quarantine facility .
" R@@ M@@ IT University Vietnam has been in collaboration with authorities to help our students and l@@ ec@@ ture@@ rs take commercial flights transiting in Asian countries like Singapore and South Korea to come back to Vietnam since the beginning of October , before the start of the new sem@@ ester , " Prof@@ . Co@@ lo@@ e .
A@@ d - ho@@ c solution : going online
Dr. Giang said his university has offered students full online courses , as only around 50 percent of its international students are living in Vietnam .
Despite some advant@@ ages , online courses are not as good as normal classes , he re@@ marked .
Re@@ gar@@ ding teaching Vietnamese , which is believed to be hard to learn , students can not ob@@ serve the ways a teacher p@@ ron@@ oun@@ ces . This is really difficult for foreign students .
" As a result , l@@ ec@@ ture@@ rs have to send documents to lear@@ ners who can use them to learn by themselves , " said Giang .
Although FPT University can provide online courses for international students who fail come to Vietnam due to the pandemic , this way of teaching is not as effective as physical classes , Dr. Tung said .
T@@ aking online classes , students will lose the opportunity to experience the Vietnamese culture and society .
L@@ ack of foreign teachers
Many educational institutions in Vietnam have seen a severe shortage of foreign teachers given the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic .
The head of the marketing department of an English language school franch@@ ise chain in Ho Chi Minh City revealed that ten of their centers have fallen short of more than 50 foreign teachers .
If Hanoi and Da Nang are taken into account , the system is l@@ acking in nearly 200 foreign l@@ ec@@ ture@@ rs .
Travel restrictions to prevent the pandemic have been considered as the main reason for such a de@@ ar@@ th .
Soc@@ c@@ er super@@ star Cris@@ ti@@ ano R@@ onal@@ do flies to Italy after testing positive for coronavirus
Cris@@ ti@@ ano R@@ onal@@ do is returning to Tur@@ in , Italy , abo@@ ard a private air am@@ bul@@ ance , after testing positive for Covid - 19 on Tuesday .
Ju@@ ven@@ tu@@ s confirmed on Wednesday that its star forward would be able to continue his isolation at home after his flight from Por@@ tu@@ gal was author@@ ized by health authorities .
According to the head of Por@@ tu@@ gal 's General Health Direc@@ tor@@ ate , Gra@@ ç@@ a Fre@@ it@@ as , such movement is permitted given R@@ onal@@ do , who has resid@@ ency in Italy , organized and paid for his own private transport .
R@@ onal@@ do had to submit to an evaluation by health authorities before he left Por@@ tu@@ gal and sign a term of responsibility . He will be under ob@@ servation and custo@@ dy of Italian health officials upon his arrival in Tur@@ in .
" These are international procedures , they are quite well typ@@ i@@ fied , the European Union member states are obli@@ g@@ ated to comply with them , and we comply with them for an an@@ onym@@ ous citizen as for a known one , " Fre@@ it@@ as told journal@@ ists at a daily brief@@ ing on the state of the pandemic in the country .
Cris@@ ti@@ ano R@@ onal@@ do tests positive for coronavirus
The 35 - year - old R@@ onal@@ do played for Por@@ tu@@ gal against France in the Nations League on Sunday and against Spain in a friendly last week .
On Monday , he posted a photo to social media of him sharing a meal with his Por@@ tu@@ gal te@@ am@@ mates .
Following his positive test , the Por@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese Football Federation said R@@ onal@@ do was " well , without symptoms , and in isolation . "
It also confirmed that every other player subsequently returned a negative test on Tuesday morning .
R@@ onal@@ do is now set to miss his country 's next Nations League fi@@ x@@ ture against Sweden on Wednesday , as well as Ju@@ ven@@ tu@@ s ' upcoming matches which include a Ser@@ ie A clas@@ h with Cro@@ t@@ one and a Champ@@ ions League group game against D@@ y@@ nam@@ o Ky@@ i@@ v .
It comes as Ju@@ ven@@ tu@@ s confirmed mid@@ fiel@@ der Wes@@ ton Mc@@ K@@ enni@@ e tested positive for the virus on Wednesday , meaning the entire team is isol@@ ating until they are tested again .
The Por@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese Football Federation and R@@ onal@@ do 's representatives were not immediately available for CNN 's request for comment .
George R@@ am@@ say and Mar@@ ti@@ j@@ n E@@ del@@ man contributed to this reporting .
She had a heart attack during lockdown and has subsequently been diagnosed with heart failure .
In July , she was told she needed to have an im@@ plan@@ table cardi@@ over@@ ter de@@ fi@@ br@@ ill@@ ator ( IC@@ D ) f@@ it@@ ted , which can shock the heart back into r@@ hy@@ th@@ m when it det@@ ects a potential cardi@@ ac arrest .
But 12 weeks on , she is still waiting . " I could have a cardi@@ ac arrest at any point , " Sar@@ ah says .
" It is aw@@ ful not kno@@ wing what is going to happen .
" I am on the urgent list - but the infection rates are rising and the clin@@ ics are closing .
" I do n't know when I will get it .
" There are so many people in my position - we do n't have Covid but our lives are at risk too .
" We are the for@@ go@@ t@@ ten victims of this pandemic . "
S@@ har@@ p rise
British Heart Foundation analysis of Office for National Statistics data for England and Wales found almost 800 extra deaths from heart disease among under - 6@@ 5@@ s from March to July - 15 % more than would be expected .
The rate of death was highest during the full lockdown - but , wor@@ r@@ y@@ ingly , the trend continued after@@ wards .
The charity bl@@ ames del@@ ays in people seeking care , as well as reduced access to rou@@ tine tests and treatments .
And NHS England figures show a sharp rise in the numbers waiting over six weeks for a whole range of key tests , including ech@@ oc@@ ar@@ di@@ o@@ grams for hear@@ ts .
B@@ H@@ F associ@@ ate medical director Dr S@@ on@@ ya Bab@@ u - N@@ ar@@ ay@@ an says the consequences of the pandemic have been " tra@@ gic " .
" Covid has put people with heart and circul@@ atory conditions at greater risk than ever , " she says .
And it is essential people seek help if they are worried about their health .
" Do n't delay because you think hospitals are too busy , " Bab@@ u - N@@ ar@@ ay@@ an says .
" The NHS still has systems in place to safe@@ ly treat you . "
Tra@@ um@@ atic impact
Heart disease is not the only condition affected . Sim@@ il@@ ar warnings have been made by patient groups for other conditions .
Mac@@ m@@ ill@@ an C@@ anc@@ er Su@@ p@@ port says a drop in re@@ fer@@ r@@ als for urgent cancer check - u@@ ps , people starting treatment and the numbers being screened is threatening to have a " tra@@ um@@ atic " impact on people 's lives now and in the future .
It is unclear how many lives have been lost for non-@@ Covid reasons .
There were a total of 1@@ 3,000 non-@@ Covid exc@@ ess deaths in England and Wales during the first eight weeks of the pandemic .
Since then , overall death rates have returned to close to normal .
But many more people than would be expected are still d@@ ying at home .
An extra 28@@ ,000 deaths in private homes have been recorded since the pandemic started , which is higher than the exc@@ ess death toll in care homes .
And a third of them were in July , August and September , when Covid death rates were very low .
The Office for National Statistics is investigating the cause .
The numbers d@@ ying in hospital have been lower than expected in recent months , so it may just be people are choo@@ sing to die at home .
But the Nu@@ ff@@ i@@ eld Tru@@ st says it could also be a sign people are going without vital treatment .
The numbers attending accident - and - emergency units dropped by 50 % in April and have still not recovered to normal levels .
Coronavirus : Virus isolation period extended from seven to 10 days
People who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms in the UK must now self - isolate for at least 10 days , rather than seven .
The change , announced by the UK 's chief medical officers , comes as minis@@ ters try to avoid a resur@@ gence of the virus .
Until now , those showing key symptoms - a new continu@@ ous cough , a temperature or loss of taste or sm@@ ell - have had to self - isolate for at least a week .
The new advice is in line with World Health Organization guidance .
The chief medical officers said the change is " particularly important to protect those who have been shi@@ el@@ ding and in advance of the au@@ tumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission " .
E@@ vi@@ dence shows that people with Covid - 19 have " a low but real possibility of infec@@ ti@@ ous@@ ness " between seven and nine days after falling ill , they said .
People are most conta@@ gious just before they first dis@@ play symptoms and for the first few days after@@ wards . But scientists say evidence that they could pass it on up to nine days later has " strength@@ ened " .
Ad@@ vice on the length of isolation var@@ ies between countries . For example , the Iris@@ h Republic says those who have symptoms should isolate for 14 days , while in the US those with symptoms are told to isolate for 10 days and can only leave isolation if they have had at least 24 hours without a fever .
It comes after the prime minister warned of signs of a " second wave " of the pandemic in parts of Europe .
Speaking on BBC B@@ re@@ ak@@ fast before the announcement , Health Secretary Mat@@ t Han@@ cock said the government wanted to " take a precau@@ tionary approach " and " protect people from that wave reaching our sho@@ res " .
Fr@@ ank A@@ ther@@ ton , chief medical officer for Wales , said the change was " vital " and " no@@ body should be under the il@@ lu@@ sion that coronavirus has gone away " .
The government has also confirmed that registered health and care professionals travelling to the UK from high - risk countries will be required to self - isolate for 14 days . An quarantine exemp@@ tion for health professionals had been in place since June .
There have also been concerns about several local outbreaks across the UK , including in Old@@ ham , W@@ re@@ x@@ ham and St@@ aff@@ ord@@ shi@@ re .
Meanwhile , the government is expected on Friday to announ@@ ce a decision on whether to ease restrictions in Le@@ ic@@ ester , a month after the city was put into extended lockdown following a sp@@ i@@ ke in cases .
The may@@ or of Le@@ ic@@ ester , S@@ ir Peter Sou@@ l@@ s@@ by , expressed fru@@ stration at the delayed decision , originally expected on Thursday .
" We have n't got a clu@@ e what 's going on , we really have n't , " he said .
The br@@ akes are beginning to come on
Two or three weeks ago the message from the prime minister was that , ho@@ pe@@ fully , we would be back to near - norm@@ ality by Christmas .
The direction of travel was one of lockdown easing , with pub@@ s and restaurants reopening , as well as a feeling that we se@@ emed to be getting through it .
Now , there 's a real sense of the br@@ akes beginning to go on .
We saw it with the quick quarantine measures imposed on people returning from Spain . Luxembourg may well have similar restrictions soon and they 're keeping an eye on Belgium too .
We had restrictions imposed in Old@@ ham to cur@@ b the virus there and now there 's been an exten@@ sion of the self - isolation period .
The real ap@@ preh@@ en@@ sion is that what is happening in the rest of Europe may , in time , happen here .
To some ex@@ tent , that has been the story of coronavirus : we have ten@@ ded to follow what has emerged in mainland Europe .
Offic@@ ial figures published on Thursday showed that 4@@ 3,@@ 1@@ 19 people who tested positive for Covid - 19 in England had their cases transferred to NHS T@@ est and Tr@@ ace since its launch in May .
The tracing system successfully contacted just over 77 % of these - but just over 23 % were not reached .
The figures , from the Department of Health and Social C@@ are , also showed that of 22@@ 2,@@ 5@@ 89 people identified as close contacts of those who tested positive , 83 % had been reached and asked to self - isolate .
Prime Minister Bor@@ is Johnson 's pl@@ edge - that by the end of June everyone tested in person would receive results within 24 hours - is still not being met , with about three - quarters ( 7@@ 6.@@ 4 % ) of people getting results on time in the week up to July 22 .
For those using home testing kits , 7@@ 6.@@ 9 % received results within 48 hours .
But the government is concerned that some people are not coming forward for testing , ham@@ per@@ ing its ability to track outbreaks , because they wro@@ ngly think they have to pay for it or that they are not eligible .
A decision that could have been taken months ago
The UK require@@ ment for people who test positive or show symptoms to isolate for seven days was always on the low side - pl@@ enty of other countries require 10 days or even longer .
As coronavirus is new , there is still a lack of cer@@ tain@@ ty over how long someone remains infectious , which is why there are a variety of appro@@ aches .
UK health officials say there is enough evidence now to point to a " low , but t@@ ang@@ i@@ ble " risk of transmission from seven to 10 days , even for those with mild to moderate illness .
This is a decision that could have been taken weeks , even months , ago in tru@@ th .
But officials are descri@@ bing it as a " value jud@@ g@@ ement " based on a variety of reasons .
For one thing the easing of restrictions means we have more social contacts than we did previously - so even with the low risk of transmission post seven days , the chances of passing it on increases .
The avail@@ ability of widespread testing also means only those with a posi@@ ti@@ vely confirmed infection need to continue isol@@ ating - earlier in the pandemic the lack of testing meant a bl@@ an@@ ket approach had to be taken so anyone with symptoms was asked to isolate .
But it is about sending an important sig@@ nal too . L@@ ev@@ els of infection are low , but the message is clear : we ca n't be com@@ plac@@ ent .
The government is laun@@ ching a TV and online advertising campaign on Thursday night str@@ essing that anyone with symptoms should get tested , which is free and available to all .
Only about a third of people infected are thought to come forward for tests , although some of the un@@ tested cases may be people who do not have any symptoms .
Those in a household with anyone who tests positive or shows symptoms are told to self - isolate for 14 days .
And people returning to the UK from certain countries are also being asked to quarantine for 14 days - a move that has sp@@ ar@@ ked compl@@ ain@@ ts from travel firms .
Minis@@ ters are also looking for a way to reduce the current 14 - day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK , meaning that quarantine and self - isolation time perio@@ ds could be stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed at 10 days .
Mr Han@@ cock told Today that the government is looking at using testing to reduce the length of the quarantine period - but there would be no im@@ minent changes .
On Thursday evening , Luxembourg was removed from the quarantine - free list , meaning people arriving in the UK from the small land - locked country from midnight will need to self - isolate for two weeks .
A senior government source told the BBC that Belgium would stay off the list - for the moment - but case numbers would continue to be monitored .
Lea@@ ding travel and airline industry figures called on Wednesday for coronavirus testing at airports in the UK but the source said that " any new system had to be work@@ able and at the moment it is n't " .
Mr Han@@ cock told B@@ re@@ ak@@ fast that the " big scientific challenge " with testing arrivals at the border is that people " can in@@ cub@@ ate this disease for many days without dis@@ playing any symptoms , and that would n't show up in a test " .
What are the rules on self - isol@@ ating ?
Sel@@ f - isol@@ ating means staying at home and not leaving it .
An@@ yone who has either tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms should isolate themselves for at least 10 days , and those who show symptoms should ar@@ range to get tested .
Symptoms include : a new continu@@ ous cough , a high temperature , and a loss of , or change in , your normal sense of taste or sm@@ ell .
They should continue to self - isolate if they still feel un@@ well after that initial period .
Other members of their household should isolate for 14 days and not leave their homes .
If you test positive you will be contacted by contact trac@@ ers , who will establish who else you might have passed on the infection to .
An@@ y@@ body they de@@ em to be at risk will have to isolate themselves for 14 days from the point of contact .
Australian new@@ sw@@ ire high@@ lights Vietnam ’s success in fighting COVID - 19 resur@@ gence
The convers@@ ation@@ .@@ com reported that Europe could look to the success of countries like Vietnam as the contin@@ ent is again in the gri@@ p of a COVID - 19 resur@@ gence .
It high@@ ligh@@ ted targeted testing as an effective t@@ acti@@ c used by Vietnamese health authorities , where they have focused on high - risk individuals and on buildings and neighb@@ our@@ hoods where there have been confirmed cases . Health authorities have also implemented exten@@ sive contact tracing , and aimed to identify those at risk of exposure regardless of symptoms .
The country also set up quarantine facilities for infected people and international travellers , minim@@ ising spread inside households .
It noted that having experienced the SARS and avi@@ an flu epid@@ emics , many Asian countries took the threat of COVID - 19 seriously right from the beginning .
In addition , many countries implemented strict mask wearing and physical distancing early . T@@ arg@@ eted testing , education and the involvement of the community are critical in responding to COVID - 19 . / . VNA
Many state - owned groups see big losses amid COVID - 19 crisis
Many enterprises have reported big losses because of Covid - 19 , including large state - owned groups .
The government ’s report to the National Assembly show a sharp decline in tax and fee coll@@ ec@@ tions as businesses have been hit hard by Covid - 19 . The decrease is also attribu@@ ted to the policies on tax re@@ missions and tax payment dead@@ line exten@@ sions , amoun@@ ting to VND 18.@@ 78 trillion .
“ The tax collection in the first nine months of the year was the lowest in many years , ” the report said . .
The tax and fee coll@@ ec@@ tions were just equ@@ al to 6@@ 1.6 percent of the y@@ early plan , a decrease of 8.@@ 1 percent decrease compared with the same period last year . Meanwhile , in previous years , the coll@@ ec@@ tions of the first nine months of 2016 - 2019 were 6@@ 9.@@ 7 - 72 percent of the y@@ early plans and the coll@@ ec@@ tions increased by 7 - 15.@@ 2 percent year after year .
Covid - 19 , which has seriously affected China , the US and Europe , the biggest partners of Vietnam , has also affected Vietnam trade , especially exports , leading to a decrease of VND 3@@ 5.@@ 27@@ 9 trillion in state budget collection compared with the same period last year .
The price of crude oil fell to below $ 40 per barrel in the first nine months of the year , causing a consider@@ able decrease to revenue for the state budget .
The government thinks the state budget collection in the last three months of the year will still face difficulties .
The second Covid - 19 outbreak occurred in key economic centers , including Da Nang , Quang Nam , Hai Duong , Hanoi and HCM City . And Vietnam ’s big trade partners have not controlled the epidemic and as a result Vietnam ’s exports and investment will still b@@ ear adver@@ se effects .

( CNN ) Despite the US seeing a rise in Covid - 19 cases and deaths , Dr. Anth@@ ony F@@ au@@ c@@ i says that things would have to get " really , really bad " for him to adv@@ oc@@ ate for a national lockdown .
The US is aver@@ aging more than 5@@ 5,000 new cases a day -- up more than 60 % since a mid-@@ September di@@ p -- and experts say the country is in the mid@@ st of the dre@@ ad@@ ed fall surge . On Friday , the US reported the most infections in a single day since July . As of Saturday , more than 8.@@ 1 million cases of the virus had been reported in the US and 2@@ 19@@ ,@@ 6@@ 66 people have died , according to Johns Hopkins University .
With all the previous and current measures to off@@ set the spread of the virus , " the country is fati@@ gu@@ ed with restrictions , " said F@@ au@@ c@@ i , director of the National Institute of Al@@ l@@ ergy and Infectious Diseases , said during an interview on " 60 Min@@ u@@ tes " Sunday night .
" We want to use public health measures not to get in the way of opening the economy , but to being a safe g@@ ate@@ way to opening the economy , " F@@ au@@ c@@ i told CBS News Chief Medical Cor@@ respon@@ dent Dr. Jon@@ athan La@@ P@@ ook during the interview .
" So instead of having an opposition , open up the economy , get jobs back , or shut down . No , put shut down away and say ' we 're going to use public health measures to help us safe@@ ly get to where we want to go . ' "
He added that it 's not safe yet to say the country is " on the road to ess@@ entially getting out of this . "
There is nearly no place in America where Covid - 19 case counts are trending in the right direction as the country heads into what health experts say will be the most challe@@ nging months of the pandemic .
Only Mis@@ sour@@ i and Ver@@ mon@@ t recorded a more than 10 % improv@@ ement in the average number of reported cases over the past week , according to the university 's data . Cases in Con@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut and Florida , on the other hand , increased by 50 % or more .
Tw@@ enty - seven states saw sp@@ ik@@ es between 10 % and 50 % : Al@@ ab@@ ama , A@@ ri@@ z@@ ona , Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , Georgia , I@@ da@@ ho , I@@ l@@ lin@@ o@@ is , In@@ di@@ ana , I@@ ow@@ a , K@@ an@@ s@@ as , Massachusetts , Michigan , Min@@ nes@@ o@@ ta , Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , N@@ eb@@ ras@@ ka , N@@ ev@@ ada , New Jer@@ sey , New Mexico , North Dak@@ o@@ ta , Ohio , R@@ ho@@ de Island , South Carol@@ ina , South Dak@@ o@@ ta , Texas , Washington , West Virgin@@ ia , W@@ is@@ cons@@ in and Wy@@ oming .
New cases are st@@ atic in the remaining states .
" This really is a har@@ ro@@ wing time , and people have to be careful , " epidemio@@ logist Dr. Ab@@ du@@ l E@@ l - S@@ ay@@ ed said .
' This surge has the potential to be way worse '
On Friday , 10 states reported their highest one - day counts : Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , I@@ da@@ ho , In@@ di@@ ana , Min@@ nes@@ o@@ ta , New Mexico , North Carol@@ ina , North Dak@@ o@@ ta , West Virgin@@ ia , W@@ is@@ cons@@ in and Wy@@ oming , according to Johns Hopkins .
As infections rise , so , too , have hospital@@ iz@@ ations . In New Mexico , hospital@@ iz@@ ations have increased 10@@ 1 % this month , G@@ ov@@ . Mich@@ el@@ le Lu@@ j@@ an G@@ ris@@ ham said .
More hospital@@ iz@@ ations will likely be followed by a rise in daily coronavirus deaths , said Dr. Francis Col@@ lin@@ s , director of the National Institu@@ tes of Health .
Though the average of 700 coronavirus deaths a day the US remains lower than the daily tol@@ ls of 1,000 in July and August , University of Washington researchers project more than 2,@@ 300 Americans could die daily by mid-@@ January .
" When we saw this kind of transmission earlier on in the pandemic , in March and April , the virus had n't see@@ ded every@@ where . ... This surge has the potential to be way worse than it was than either the spring or the summer , " E@@ l - S@@ ay@@ ed , De@@ tro@@ it 's former health director , said .
State leaders push new restrictions
Americans can help get the virus under control , experts say , by he@@ eding guidelines tou@@ ted by officials for months : avoiding crowded set@@ tings , keeping a distance , keeping small gatherings out@@ doors and wearing a mask .
" This is a good moment for people to stop and ask themselves : ' What can I do to try to be sure that we limit the further infections that o@@ ther@@ wise seem to be lo@@ oming in front of us as cold weather is k@@ ic@@ king in and people are in@@ doors , and those cur@@ ves are going up@@ ward , in the wrong direction ? ' " Col@@ lin@@ s said Friday .
The up@@ tic@@ ks have promp@@ ted state leaders to push new restrictions , including mask enforcement and limits on gatherings , in hopes of cur@@ bing the spread .
N@@ eb@@ ras@@ ka G@@ ov@@ . P@@ et@@ e R@@ ick@@ et@@ ts announced changes to the state 's health measures , including requiring hospitals to reserve at least 10 % of st@@ aff@@ ed general and ICU beds for Covid - 19 patients .
In Ken@@ tu@@ cky , G@@ ov@@ . An@@ dy B@@ es@@ hear said this month he instructed authorities to step up mask enforcement , and in New Mexico , the govern@@ or this week ordered new mass gathering li@@ mit@@ ations and a 10 p.m. closing time for establishments serving alcohol .
" Every New Mexican can and must do their part to stop the spread of COVID - 19 by staying home , limiting their inter@@ actions with others , and wearing their masks , " G@@ ris@@ ham twe@@ eted .
Many countries in Europe are seeing another wave of coronavirus infections . Paris and other parts of France have introduced ni@@ gh@@ tly cur@@ fe@@ ws to cur@@ b the spread .
The daily tally of new cases sur@@ passed 3@@ 2,000 in France on Saturday . The central area of the capital is bu@@ st@@ ling with people .
But as the c@@ lock stri@@ kes 9 p.m. , few people remain . The streets are nearly deser@@ ted .
In some areas hit hard by the virus , ni@@ gh@@ tly cur@@ fe@@ ws from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. will stay in place for at least four weeks .
One restaurant in central Paris has started offering dinner an hour earlier than usual . All the customers leave by 9 .
The restaurant owner said , " The number of customers had finally started to recover in au@@ tumn , but now we get this shock . I think it is going to be a very difficult time for us and many other restaurants . "
New cases are also rising again in other countries , shoo@@ ting past levels seen during the spring .
In Italy , nearly 1@@ 1,000 cases were confirmed on Saturday . It was single - day record . Germany and Poland also reported one - day records .
Belgium will implement a cur@@ few from midnight to 5 a.m. on Monday . All bars and restaurants must stay closed for four weeks .
The foreign minis@@ ters of Belgium and Austria have both tested positive for the virus .
They s@@ at next to each other at a meeting of EU Foreign Minis@@ ters in Luxembourg earlier this month . But it 's not confirmed that the two cases are related .
Virus Res@@ ur@@ gence Se@@ es World Central Ban@@ kers S@@ tic@@ k to G@@ lo@@ om@@ y T@@ one
S@@ ign up here for our daily coronavirus new@@ s@@ letter on what you need to know , and subscri@@ be to our Covid - 19 po@@ d@@ cast for the latest news and analysis .
Global central ban@@ kers are under no il@@ lu@@ sion that they ’re through the fall@@ out from the coronavirus , issuing fresh warnings about new government restrictions , struggling recoveries and thre@@ ats to jobs .
Mon@@ et@@ ary chi@@ efs from the e@@ uro area , Japan and the U. K. were un@@ ited in their concern about their economies in an online sem@@ in@@ ar hosted by the Group of 30 . They all said risks to the out@@ look remain to the down@@ side and sign@@ aled support is going to be needed for some time . Bank of Japan Govern@@ or Har@@ u@@ hi@@ ko K@@ uro@@ da even warned that his economy is at risk of a recession if things turn s@@ our .
“ Japan is likely to follow an improving trend . However , this out@@ look is highly un@@ certain , ” he said . “ If growth expec@@ tations drop and the financial system becomes un@@ stable , the economy could fall into a full - fle@@ d@@ ged recession . ”
2020 GDP Fore@@ cast
While the situation across advanced economies is sha@@ ky , Europe ’s out@@ look has been particularly d@@ ented by new cur@@ bs imposed to contain the spread of the virus . European Central Bank President Chris@@ tine L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de ac@@ know@@ le@@ d@@ ged that point head on , saying the measures could further hin@@ der a recovery that ’s already started to f@@ ade .
“ The recovery in the e@@ uro area remains un@@ certain , un@@ even and in@@ complete , ” she told her colleagues . “ The new coronavirus - related restrictions currently being introduced across Europe will add to un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty for firms and households . ”
The measures announced last week include a French cur@@ few in Paris and other cities , while outside the e@@ uro zone , the U. K. imposed new rules on gatherings . Italy , which hit a daily record of virus cases Sunday , may impose more cur@@ bs this week . Ireland is considering health authorities ’ recommend@@ ation to move the nation to the tigh@@ test lockdown level .
L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de also discussed an additional wor@@ ry , which is the dram@@ atic des@@ truc@@ tion of work from the pandemic . She high@@ ligh@@ ted that the situation has been worsen@@ ed because of the greater damage in “ job rich ” services , which account for almost 75 % of employment in e@@ uro - area countries .
Comp@@ oun@@ ding that , the services recovery will be s@@ lower because it does n’t benefit like dur@@ able - goods manufacturing does from p@@ ent - up demand .
“ The car that you did not buy in March you are going to buy in September , ” she said . “ But the vac@@ ation you could not take in March , you are not going to take in October . ”
From the Bank of England , Govern@@ or Andrew B@@ ail@@ ey echo@@ ed that t@@ one , saying there ’s an “ unprecedented level of economic un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty , ” no@@ ting in particular the recent resur@@ gence of virus cases .
He said the risks remain “ very heavily s@@ ke@@ wed toward the down@@ side . ”
“ To bor@@ row a phr@@ ase from sports , I ’m afraid the hard y@@ ards in are still to come , ” he said .
EC@@ B ’s L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de S@@ ays Virus Cur@@ bs W@@ ill B@@ ol@@ ster Economic Un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty
P@@ and@@ emic impact on services is of particular concern , she says .
L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de says recovery remains in@@ complete , un@@ even , un@@ certain .
New restrictions being rolled out across the e@@ uro area to cur@@ b the surge of infections will increase un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty for companies and families , European Central Bank President Chris@@ tine L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de said .
The lo@@ p - si@@ ded impact that the pandemic has on services is particularly wor@@ rying as the sector accounts for 75 % of employment in the 19 - nation region , she said . That may slow the recovery and increase in@@ equality .
“ The recovery remains un@@ certain , un@@ even and in@@ complete , ” L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de told a panel discus@@ sion with heads of central banks from the U. K. , China and Japan . “ It is clear that both f@@ is@@ cal support and mon@@ et@@ ary policy support have to remain in place for as long as necessary and ‘ c@@ lif@@ f effects ’ must be avo@@ ided . ”
The re@@ marks under@@ score policy makers ’ growing concern about the p@@ ace of recovery . Wea@@ ker spending on consumer goods in the summer months suggested that there is n’t much p@@ ent - up demand , meaning sales lost are un@@ likely to be made up at a later point .
L@@ ess than two weeks before the EC@@ B ’s next policy meeting , the out@@ look for the e@@ uro - area has been growing rapidly worse after countries imposed cur@@ fe@@ ws and other restrictions to stop the spread of the virus .
While officials have reasons to delay a decision on increasing their 1.@@ 35 trillion e@@ uro ( $ 1.6 trillion ) emergency b@@ ond - buying program , Ex@@ ecu@@ tive Board member F@@ ab@@ i@@ o Pan@@ et@@ ta said on Saturday new cur@@ bs put the recovery further from reach .
Covid Cases Ex@@ tend ‘ Tr@@ ou@@ bling ’ Sur@@ ge , S@@ ign@@ al@@ ing More D@@ ea@@ ths
A medical staff member per@@ forms a Covid - 19 test in F@@ argo , North Dak@@ o@@ ta .
The number of daily Covid - 19 cases is continuing its st@@ ea@@ dy clim@@ b as temperatures begin to di@@ p across the U. S. , students return to class@@ rooms and more people stay in@@ doors where the virus spreads easily .
While far fewer people are ending up hospitalized with the illness than during the pandemic ’s surge in March and April , many more deaths are expected to be added to almost 2@@ 18@@ ,000 already reported nationally as cases sp@@ i@@ ke , experts said .
“ If you take a look from 30,000 feet , most states have rising case numbers , ” with no down@@ ward trends to be seen , said William Sch@@ aff@@ ner , an infectious disease special@@ ist at V@@ and@@ er@@ bil@@ t University in N@@ ash@@ ville , Ten@@ nes@@ see . “ That is trou@@ bling as winter appro@@ aches . ”
Nation@@ ally , seven - day moving case aver@@ ages have climbed to their highest in two months , while the number of currently hospitalized Covid - 19 patients was the most since Aug@@ . 27 , according to Johns Hopkins University and Covid Tr@@ acking Project data .
The seven - day average of deaths due to Covid - 19 is still at about a third of peak levels in April , but a decline that took place over recent weeks appears to have stopped . Re@@ por@@ ted deaths often la@@ g behind other numbers by several weeks , said Sch@@ aff@@ ner , so those numbers will likely follow the rising number of cases and hospital@@ iz@@ ations .
Rural Sur@@ ges
“ All of us anti@@ cip@@ ate Covid is going to increase this winter , ” he said .
Ho@@ pes that warm summer weather might t@@ am@@ p down spread were fru@@ str@@ ated by outbreaks in Sun B@@ elt states . Since then , there ’s been a surge of cases in the U@@ pper Mid@@ west and on college cam@@ p@@ uses across the country . The highest case rates per cap@@ ita in the past seven days have been in North Dak@@ o@@ ta , South Dak@@ o@@ ta , Mon@@ t@@ ana , W@@ is@@ cons@@ in and U@@ ta@@ h . South Dak@@ o@@ ta leads the nation in Covid - 19 hospital@@ iz@@ ations per cap@@ ita .
Those trends , and similar increases across Europe , are cause for al@@ arm , said New York City May@@ or Bill D@@ e B@@ las@@ i@@ o .
“ It ’s ab@@ solu@@ tely trou@@ bling to see how far these places are falling back@@ wards , ” he said Friday in an appearance on W@@ N@@ Y@@ C radio . “ We ca n’t allow that to happen here . ”
While the initial surge of the virus hit den@@ sely popul@@ ated urban areas , it ’s now over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming rural regions , sub@@ ur@@ bs and small cities . Based on the seven - day rol@@ ling average of new cases , New Mexico , Mis@@ sour@@ i , South Dak@@ o@@ ta , Michigan and I@@ l@@ lin@@ o@@ is have seen the biggest increases in the past week , by percentage .
“ Over@@ all , it ’s looking gri@@ m to see the infections on the rise and the hospital@@ iz@@ ations tracking with that , ” said E@@ ric To@@ po@@ l , director of the S@@ cri@@ pp@@ s Tran@@ sl@@ ational Research Institute in La J@@ ol@@ la , California .
Daily Cases P@@ er 100,000 by Ur@@ ban - Rural C@@ las@@ si@@ fication
The growing number of daily cases is a key indic@@ ator of the virus ’s nationwide spread . With holiday soci@@ al@@ izing , influenza and winter weather all on the hor@@ iz@@ on , the increased number of hospital@@ iz@@ ations is also cause for concern that the health - care system may soon be over@@ wh@@ el@@ med once again in certain areas .
In@@ de@@ ed , hospitals in the U@@ pper Mid@@ west hot spots are reporting their resources str@@ et@@ ched and having to send patients to hospitals hours away or even in other states . With the patho@@ gen now more en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched in the population , winter ’s surge could be worse than the first .
“ We are arriving at the Covid - 19 perfect storm , ” said Michael O@@ ster@@ hol@@ m , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Min@@ nes@@ o@@ ta . The current increases are only the start of a long winter ahead , he said .
Im@@ prov@@ ed Tre@@ at@@ ment
One bright spot , O@@ ster@@ hol@@ m said , is that hospitals have become far more ad@@ ept and have more tools available to treat the virus . Medic@@ ines like Gil@@ ead Sciences Inc. ’s rem@@ des@@ i@@ vi@@ r and gener@@ ic st@@ ero@@ id d@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one , both given to President Donald Trump after he was diagnosed , are helping people recover .
In@@ cre@@ ased testing is also cat@@ ching more cases early . The Trump administration announced last month that it would distribu@@ te 150 million rapid tests made by Ab@@ bot@@ t Lab@@ or@@ atories for use in nursing homes , schools , and hard - hit minority populations .
U. S. Cur@@ rent Covid - 19 Hospit@@ al@@ iz@@ ations
Di@@ agno@@ stics manufacturers are now shi@@ pping more than 1.4 million tests nationwide each day , up from 60@@ 0,000 at the start of May , according to Ad@@ va@@ M@@ ed , a trade group for the medical - technology industry . To@@ tal shi@@ p@@ ments have sur@@ passed 190 million tests .
But even states that not long ago appeared to be doing well have seen resur@@ gen@@ ces . In New York City , schools shut@@ tered in several neighbor@@ hoods shortly after reopening after a sp@@ i@@ ke in cases in those areas .
“ We ’re just getting started , ” said O@@ ster@@ hol@@ m , “ And how bad it ’s going to be is depen@@ dent on how the population respon@@ ds . Ri@@ ght now , up to a third of the public does n’t believe this is real ; they believe it ’s a ho@@ a@@ x . ”
Coronavirus vaccine : Is Chil@@ e@@ an tree bar@@ k a key ingredi@@ ent ?
The qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , which gro@@ ws in the Chil@@ e@@ an An@@ des , has tra@@ ditionally been used by the M@@ ap@@ u@@ che to treat col@@ ds and inflam@@ mation . But it could play a significant role in a vaccine for the novel coronavirus .
The Chil@@ e@@ an bio@@ tech company Des@@ ert King is a significant actor in the race to develop a COVID - 19 vaccine . The firm has developed a procedure that allows for active agents to be extrac@@ ted from the bar@@ k and wood of the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , which only gro@@ ws in Ch@@ ile . Des@@ ert King s@@ ells the resulting pow@@ der to a British subsidiary of the US vaccine development company Nov@@ ov@@ a@@ x .
Nov@@ ov@@ a@@ x announced in late September that it had initi@@ ated its first Phase 3 study to evalu@@ ate the efficacy and safety of its vaccine in the UK , and that it aimed to en@@ roll 10,000 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 84 to take part . Currently , there are 11 COVID - 19 vaccine candidates in the third phase of testing .
Des@@ ert King General Man@@ ager An@@ d@@ res G@@ on@@ z@@ ales told D@@ W that if all went well , production of the vaccine could start early next year .
M@@ ulti@@ purpose fo@@ aming agents
" A vaccine is comp@@ ris@@ ed of two el@@ ements , an anti@@ gen and an ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant , " explained G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez . " The anti@@ gen activ@@ ates a body 's own defense , while the ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant helps release the anti@@ gen into the cells and also stimul@@ ates the body 's immune response . "
The qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , also known as the so@@ ap bar@@ k tree , has a high content of sa@@ p@@ on@@ ins , which are natural em@@ ul@@ si@@ fi@@ ers and multi@@ purpose fo@@ aming agents . They can be used to b@@ ind substances that usually do not mix , such as water and oil , but they can also serve as ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ants .
After conduc@@ ting studies into the 50 od@@ d sa@@ p@@ on@@ ins contained in the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , Des@@ ert King identified two substances — Q@@ S@@ 7 and Q@@ S@@ 21 — that could function as an ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant in a potential vaccine .
" We are already producing industrial quanti@@ ties of qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja for Nov@@ av@@ a@@ x , " said G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez .
The qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree can grow up to 20 meters ( 65 feet ) high ; its tr@@ un@@ k can reach a di@@ am@@ eter of 1.5 meters . It flowers from October to January , producing an ar@@ omatic hon@@ ey . The ever@@ green , with sm@@ ooth and lea@@ ther@@ y leaves , has small , y@@ el@@ low@@ ish - white star - formed b@@ los@@ s@@ oms . With its five fol@@ li@@ cles , the w@@ oody fruit of the tree res@@ emb@@ les star an@@ ise .
U@@ sed in traditional M@@ ap@@ u@@ che medicine
The M@@ ap@@ u@@ che , the largest in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous group in Ch@@ ile today , have long known about the h@@ ealing properties of the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree . In their traditional medicine , they use the bar@@ k ex@@ tract as a dec@@ ong@@ est@@ ant and also to treat dig@@ es@@ tive problems . They also make a tin@@ c@@ ture from the flowers to treat the symptoms of r@@ he@@ um@@ ati@@ s@@ m .
Qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja can also be used to make a natural sha@@ m@@ po@@ o and the food industry uses it in beer production , for example .
H@@ it by climate change
Un@@ for@@ tunately , the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , which is generally adap@@ table , un@@ demanding and can grow on bar@@ re@@ n land and mountain s@@ lo@@ pes , is suffering from the consequences of climate change , said R@@ en@@ e Car@@ mon@@ a of the Fac@@ ul@@ ty of Fore@@ st Sciences and Nature Con@@ servation at the University of Ch@@ ile in S@@ anti@@ ago . " The d@@ rou@@ ghts that Ch@@ ile has been experiencing for 10 years have caused damage to the trees on s@@ lo@@ pes in particular . "
G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez of Des@@ ert King said that the producers of qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja sa@@ p@@ on@@ ins in Ch@@ ile were ke@@ en to work sust@@ ain@@ ably . He added that trees would be p@@ ru@@ ned rather than cut down , " This en@@ sures that the trees have less bi@@ om@@ ass and need less water so that they can better cope with drought . "
But Car@@ mon@@ a said another major problem was that the tree was often cut down for its wood . He ho@@ ped that its use by pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als could help raise awareness about the importance of protecting the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja trees .
" The fact that an international pharmaceutical company is using this substance to develop a vaccine against COVID - 19 will help us to promote the tree 's importance to people , " Car@@ mon@@ a said . " We hope that people will stop using the tree for fire@@ wood . "
German gl@@ ass@@ maker holds key to COVID - 19 vaccine supply
As the world wa@@ its anxi@@ ously for a COVID - 19 vaccine , a German company is doing its bit to ensure that the shot rea@@ ches you with its po@@ ten@@ cy int@@ act . A@@ shu@@ to@@ sh Pan@@ de@@ y reports from its M@@ ain@@ z headquarters .
It 's l@@ un@@ ch@@ time at S@@ cho@@ t@@ t 's sp@@ ra@@ w@@ ling campus in M@@ ain@@ z , home to the gl@@ ass@@ maker 's headquarters and pharm@@ a glass - tu@@ bing production unit . The can@@ teen is bu@@ z@@ zing with employees , many of them re@@ lis@@ hing the meal … as well as some sun ; on - site din@@ ing made a com@@ eb@@ ack just a few weeks back after being stopped at the h@@ eight of the pandemic .
A to@@ w@@ ering red ch@@ im@@ ney of one of the plants over@@ looks the outdoor din@@ ing area , where the t@@ ables are even@@ ly spac@@ ed out in line with social distancing norm@@ s . All t@@ ables are occu@@ pi@@ ed , but con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous by their abs@@ ence are the tu@@ bing plant staff , o@@ ther@@ wise difficult to miss in their blue uni@@ forms . I am told that 's because the l@@ un@@ ch hours have been divi@@ ded into s@@ lots to check the spread of the coronavirus by minim@@ izing contact between one set of employees and the other .
The strategy , along with other safety measures like a ban on visitors entering the production plants , seems to have worked so far . S@@ cho@@ t@@ t has managed to keep production running at its facility without any dis@@ rup@@ tions , even when the virus was w@@ re@@ aking ha@@ vo@@ c in the region in spring .
The critical pharm@@ a tu@@ bing plant produces one - and - a-@@ half meter - long glass tu@@ bes , which are used to make pharm@@ a vi@@ als at the company 's plant in M@@ ü@@ ll@@ h@@ ei@@ m , a small town about 300 kilometers ( 18@@ 6 miles ) south of M@@ ain@@ z in one of Germany 's most indus@@ tri@@ alized states of B@@ ad@@ en - W@@ ü@@ r@@ tt@@ emb@@ er@@ g .
The 130 - year - old firm , whose glass is used in products ranging from cooking tops to tel@@ es@@ co@@ pes , has committed to supply enough vi@@ als to hold up to 2 billion doses of COVID - 19 vaccines .
S@@ cho@@ t@@ t , which has already supp@@ lied millions of vi@@ als to COVID - 19 vaccine makers , says it 's well - placed to boost capacity at its production facilities , including in the US and Germany , to produce vi@@ als for another 1 billion doses . It is estimated that the world would need some 15 billion doses , as@@ sum@@ ing the successful vaccine is a twin - do@@ se vaccine .
" We have a one - time chance to be part of the solution . We know that there are hundreds of vaccines being currently developed and we know that all those vaccines will need the pack@@ aging and S@@ cho@@ t@@ t is prepared to provide that pack@@ aging , " said F@@ ab@@ ian St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er , head of Str@@ ate@@ gy and In@@ no@@ v@@ ation at S@@ cho@@ t@@ t 's pharm@@ a unit . " It 's very mo@@ tiv@@ ating and a good feeling to be a part of efforts to get rid of this pandemic . "
Govern@@ ments , firms , and international organizations across the glo@@ be are spending billions of dollars to launch mass production of yet - to - be@@ -@@ approved vaccines and to boost supply chain cap@@ abilities , making sure they are not caught off guard once the vaccines are given the green light .
Wh@@ o will get the coronavirus vaccine first ?
S@@ cho@@ t@@ t , which is@@ owned by the Car@@ l Z@@ e@@ is@@ s Foundation — the owner of the ep@@ onym@@ ous l@@ ens maker , is using bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass to make the vi@@ als . The glass , inv@@ ented by S@@ cho@@ t@@ t founder O@@ t@@ to S@@ cho@@ t@@ t , is often referred to as the gold standard for drug pack@@ aging , thanks to its extreme resistance to heat and chemicals and its in@@ er@@ t@@ ness and den@@ sity .
The glass is made using s@@ and , chemicals , including so@@ dium oxide and bor@@ ic oxide , and cru@@ sh@@ ed , recy@@ c@@ led bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass , which is usually a le@@ f@@ to@@ ver from the glass - making process . The mi@@ x@@ ture is then put in a fur@@ n@@ ace , which burns at around 1,@@ 5@@ 50 degrees Celsius . In@@ side the fur@@ n@@ ace , known as a tu@@ bing t@@ ank , there are three cham@@ bers and several bur@@ ners , which m@@ elt the mi@@ x@@ ture . All imp@@ urities are removed using ch@@ lor@@ ine gas before the liquid glass is drawn into tu@@ bes by robots .
The company says bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass is best su@@ ited for potential COVID - 19 vaccines , as it avo@@ ids the inter@@ actions between contain@@ ers and vaccines that can hurt the shot 's po@@ ten@@ cy .
S@@ cho@@ t@@ t has struck deals with several leading vaccine makers , including India 's Ser@@ um Institute , the world 's largest vaccine maker by volume , and partners of Oper@@ ation War@@ p Spe@@ ed — a public - private partnership initi@@ ated by the Trump administration to accel@@ erate vaccine development .
The company is sup@@ plying vi@@ als to three out of four of all COVID - 19 vaccine candidates in Phase I , II , or III , St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er said , adding that S@@ cho@@ t@@ t was in talks with the other pharm@@ a companies to as@@ certain the size of the vi@@ als needed .
" At this point in time , it is not fully clear what kind of pack@@ aging would be needed . It is clear we would need a glass vi@@ al , but in some cases it 's not clear what form@@ at would it be . Is it going to be a two - m@@ ill@@ il@@ it@@ er form@@ at or a 10 - m@@ ill@@ il@@ it@@ er form@@ at ? That would depen@@ d on how the vaccine is going to be ad@@ minis@@ tered later . W@@ ill it be a single shot or a multiple - do@@ se vaccine , " St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er told D@@ W .
The company is bene@@ fi@@ ting from its $ 1 billion expansion plan launched last year as it looks to meet the increasing demand for glass vi@@ als . It plans to spend half that amount by the end of next year . The company is also pu@@ mp@@ ing in additional cash on new production lines .
A un@@ ited front against COVID - 19
S@@ cho@@ t@@ t 's ri@@ vals , Ger@@ re@@ sh@@ e@@ im@@ er and St@@ ev@@ an@@ a@@ to Group , are also investing in boo@@ sting their cap@@ abilities . The three gl@@ ass@@ makers produce billions of bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass vi@@ als every year — the type that would be needed for COVID - 19 vaccines .
" The virus is not holding back at the German border , nor at the US or the Chinese or Indian border , " St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er told D@@ W . " People real@@ ize that it 's a global problem and that we need a global answer to it . That has dri@@ ven all the players in the industry to work together , putting their competitive thinking a little bit as@@ ide . "
Coronavirus vaccine producers pl@@ edge to follow normal rules , as one key trial is pa@@ used
German vaccine maker Bio@@ N@@ Te@@ ch and eight bio@@ tech companies have v@@ ow@@ ed to follow safety measures before rol@@ ling out vaccines . AstraZeneca has suspended one trial after " a potentially un@@ explained illness " in a particip@@ ant .
Several companies developing vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday pl@@ edged to " uph@@ old the integr@@ ity of the scientific process " amid growing concerns they could suc@@ cum@@ b to political pressure .
" We , the under@@ signed bio@@ pharmaceutical companies , want to make clear our ongoing commit@@ ment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID - 19 in accordance with high eth@@ ical standards and sound scientific prin@@ ci@@ ples , " said the chief execu@@ tives of AstraZeneca , Bio@@ N@@ Te@@ ch and Mo@@ der@@ na , among others .
Public health authorities have tou@@ ted a successful vaccine as the only re@@ med@@ y to the deadly patho@@ gen , which has infected 28 million people and left nearly one million others dead across the glo@@ be .
The companies said they would only seek emergency author@@ iz@@ ations for their vaccines " after demonstr@@ ating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities . "
Earlier this year , the US Food and Drug Ad@@ ministr@@ ator ( FDA ) approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and blood plasma to treat coronavirus patients , trigg@@ ering a back@@ las@@ h from experts who arg@@ ued there was not sufficient scientific evidence to prove their safe efficacy . The FDA re@@ ver@@ sed these decisions shortly after .
The race for a vaccine
Oxford / AstraZeneca trial on hold
AstraZeneca , one of the co-@@ sig@@ ners of the open pl@@ edge , told a US out@@ let that trials of their vaccine candidate were temporarily suspended after a patient fell seriously ill .
Du@@ b@@ bed the Oxford vaccine , AstraZeneca 's A@@ Z@@ D@@ 12@@ 22 went into Phase 3 clinical trials — considered the last step before regulatory approval — in the UK , US and Brazil late last month .
" As part of the ongoing r@@ and@@ om@@ ized , controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine , our standard review process was triggered and we volunt@@ arily pa@@ used vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee , " an AstraZeneca spokesperson told health news website ST@@ AT .
" This is a rou@@ tine action which has to happen wh@@ en@@ ever there is a potentially un@@ explained illness in one of the trials , while it is investigated , ensuring we maintain the integr@@ ity of the trials . "
Brazil 's health authority said later on Tuesday that AstraZeneca had halted the clinical trial and that it was waiting for more information on why , se@@ em@@ ingly cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ating the report in ST@@ AT .
M@@ aking sense of coronavirus infection statistics
At the start of the pandemic , most people focused on the coronavirus re@@ production value to assess the severity of the outbreak . Now , the COVID - 19 incid@@ ence rate is at the center of attention . What do the two terms mean ?
Until recently , the greatest concern of health authorities was to keep the re@@ production number , or R - value , for the coronavirus below the critical thre@@ sho@@ ld of 1 .
If the R - value ris@@ es above 1 , this indic@@ ates that — st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cally speaking — one infected person infec@@ ts more than one other person . Inf@@ ection rates will thus rise . If , however , the R - value falls below 1 , this indic@@ ates that one infected person will — st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cally speaking — infect fewer than one person . To contain a virus outbreak , therefore , the R - value must be kept below 1 .
On Tuesday , Germany ’s public health agency , the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute ( R@@ K@@ I ) , said the country ’s seven - day R - value was at 1.2 . But fewer people are foc@@ using on this indic@@ ator than in previous weeks and months .
Coronavirus incid@@ ence
L@@ ately , many decision - makers and ordinary people seem to be paying more attention to the cu@@ mul@@ ative number of coronavirus infections and illnesses over a certain time period . This so - called incid@@ ence is an indic@@ ator of the risk that people will contract the SARS - CoV - 2 virus within a certain time fr@@ ame .
Germany ’s seven - day incid@@ ence rate shows the number of new coronavirus infections — according to positive PC@@ T and anti@@ gen tests — within the past week per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants .
If too many individuals become infected , Germany ’s regions are urged to impose resp@@ ective security measures . These may include making masks mandatory every@@ where , introduc@@ ing cur@@ fe@@ ws , banning the sale of alcohol , limiting the number of people allowed to gather in private and at public events , restric@@ ting travel and ref@@ using to let tourists from high - risk regions stay in the area 's hotels .
Germany exten@@ ds list of cities under coronavirus cl@@ am@@ p@@ down
Munich became the latest major city to ex@@ ceed Germany ’s key coronavirus thre@@ sho@@ ld . In the capital Berlin , authorities have implemented a night@@ time cur@@ few — the first in 70 years — in response to a dram@@ atic increase in COVID - 19 cases . All Berlin businesses are required to close by 11 p.m. at least until the end of October . The number of people allowed to meet outside at night is limited to five .
What is a sen@@ sible thre@@ sho@@ ld ?
Most regions and federal states in Germany have determined that 50 new coronavirus infections per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants sig@@ nal a serious danger . The southern state of B@@ av@@ aria has introduced an early warning system : If 35 or more cases are reported within a certain part of B@@ av@@ aria , regional public health agencies must infor@@ m the state 's Health Ministry about the cause of the sp@@ i@@ ke and which counter@@ measures are being taken .
The latest coronavirus figures in Germany can be viewed on the R@@ K@@ I 's website .
The 50 - case thre@@ sho@@ ld , which is ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary but not completely without foundation , was set in May to def@@ ine a critical infection rate .
" This is when public health departments become so str@@ ained that they can no longer trac@@ e every infection to find out who became infected before , " Fr@@ ank Ul@@ rich Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery , who heads the World Medical Association ( W@@ MA ) , told public broadcas@@ ter De@@ ut@@ sch@@ land@@ fun@@ k . Once this thre@@ sho@@ ld is excee@@ ded , action must be taken , he said . This , he said , is not being al@@ ar@@ mis@@ t but " a sen@@ sible thing to do from a public health per@@ spec@@ tive . "
The R@@ K@@ I also says this 50 - case thre@@ sho@@ ld is key . On its website , the agency states that " the ab@@ solu@@ te number of new infections must be low enough to allow for effective contact tracing to happen and to keep the strain on intensive care units ( ICU ) manag@@ ea@@ ble . "
New EU traffic light system to provide ori@@ entation for tourist travel
Do more tests mean more positive results ?
However , Ste@@ f@@ an Willi@@ ch , who heads the Institute for Social Medicine , Epidemiology and Health Econom@@ ics at Berlin ’s Char@@ ite hospital , says the 50 - person thre@@ sho@@ ld is out of date . Speaking to public broadcas@@ ter R@@ B@@ B In@@ for@@ adi@@ o , Willi@@ ch said a " sen@@ sible re@@ ference " was needed to make st@@ ati@@ sti@@ cal sense of the coronavirus pandemic . He said the 50 - person mark per week per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants " se@@ emed like a prec@@ ise indic@@ ator " five months ago , but that in reality , it was little more than a rough indic@@ ation .
Willi@@ ch said many more people are now undergoing coronavirus tests than in spring , meaning that the sh@@ e@@ er number of tests will increase the li@@ kel@@ iness of higher recorded infection rates . Con@@ sequ@@ ently , he said , " we are l@@ acking a proper fr@@ ame of re@@ ference . "
Willi@@ ch recommends bas@@ ing our assessment of the ex@@ tent of the pandemic on representative samples . " I think we will come to a different defin@@ ition over the coming weeks on the basis of new samples and surve@@ ys . "
The epidemio@@ logist says he is certain that safety measures such as masks , social distancing and contact tracing will have to remain in place for quite a while longer .
" These measures are the p@@ ill@@ ars of our long - term strategy , " says Willi@@ ch , adding that if we practice them , the pandemic will be manag@@ ea@@ ble . He also says high - risk individuals in reti@@ rement and nursing homes , as well as hospitals , must be placed under special protection .
Con@@ st@@ ant up@@ d@@ ating needed
Andre@@ as G@@ ass@@ en , who heads the German National Association of St@@ at@@ ut@@ ory Health In@@ surance Ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ ans , is critical of the 50 - person thre@@ sho@@ ld , too . He told the German daily Ne@@ ue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er Z@@ e@@ it@@ ung we should stop foc@@ using on this indic@@ ator , as it sp@@ ar@@ ks " al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m . "
" Even 10,000 infections per day would not be dram@@ atic , provided only one out of 1,000 people fall gra@@ vely ill — which is what we are seeing now , " he said .
G@@ ass@@ en 's comments came in response to warnings by Robert Ko@@ ch Institute director Lo@@ th@@ ar Wi@@ el@@ er , who recently said Germany could lose control of the outbreak . G@@ ass@@ en pointed out that in spring this year , Germany recorded some 4,000 new infections and up to 150 deaths per day .
" That is over , and now we are seeing a single - di@@ git death toll , " G@@ ass@@ en said . He said that if this rati@@ o remained stable , Germany could cope even with five - figure infection rates . G@@ ass@@ en does not , therefore , expect the country ’s health care system will coll@@ ap@@ se in au@@ tumn and winter .
Fr@@ ank Ul@@ rich Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery of the W@@ MA has dis@@ agreed . " It takes between four and six weeks before someone dies from a coronavirus illness , " he said . This means , he arg@@ ued , that recently detected infections only provided a sn@@ ap@@ shot of the situation a week before . A growing number of cases ending in death were to be expected in IC@@ U@@ s only in four to five weeks ' time . " That is why I think it is too early to make such a statement , " he said .
A real@@ istic indic@@ ator ?
G@@ ass@@ en , mean@@ while , recommends analy@@ zing which age br@@ ack@@ ets are becoming infected . " I think we can allow for a sense of norm@@ ality to return , provided we communic@@ ate sen@@ sibly . " He says that if infections sp@@ i@@ ke , quick action could be taken once more .
Therefore he recommends raising the 50 - person thre@@ sho@@ ld per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants , which is currently used to classi@@ fy German regions and cities as coronavirus hot@@ spots . G@@ ass@@ en says this thre@@ sho@@ ld was defined during a time when some 40@@ 0,000 coronavirus tests were being carried out per week , which produced many positive results . Now , however , testing has been ram@@ ped up to three times this number and many results are coming back negative , he says .
G@@ ass@@ en says a new thre@@ sho@@ ld should take into consid@@ eration the significant rate of negative test results we are seeing today . He says based on the current situation , a rate of 84 infections per 100,000 would be a suitable indic@@ ator . But he is of the opinion that the number is un@@ suitable any@@ way as a ri@@ gi@@ d and sol@@ e indic@@ ator when it comes to im@@ posing rad@@ ical public health measures .
' COVID fatigue ' gri@@ ps Europe as virus spreads
Ass@@ essing travel risks
Germany also app@@ lies the 50 - person thre@@ sho@@ ld to determine whether foreign regions classi@@ fy as coronavirus hot@@ spots . The decision is made based on an analysis by the Health Ministry , Foreign Ministry , and Inter@@ ior Ministry .
In a first step , the ministries assess which foreign regions or countries recorded 50 or more coronavirus infections per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants within the last seven days . Then , in a second step , German authorities check whether regions with lower infection rates could also pose a danger . The updated German list of desig@@ n@@ ated international risk areas can be viewed here ( in German ) .
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , for its part , dis@@ plays a 14 - day - incid@@ ence figure on its website . But the agency war@@ ns against compar@@ ing coronavirus infection rates across different EU states , as this data is generated using a variety of different metho@@ do@@ logies . Some countries are mass - testing citizens , while others are not , the agency says . This , of course , has an impact on recorded coronavirus cases .
A@@ m I immune to COVID - 19 ?
Traffic - light warning system
In an effort to create more transpa@@ ren@@ cy , the EU has introduced a traffic light system to high@@ light high - risk zones in the blo@@ c . Re@@ gi@@ ons with a lack of data are marked gre@@ y .
Red zones den@@ o@@ te regions that either recorded 50 cases per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants and a test posi@@ tivity of over 4 % , or that recorded 150 cases per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants in the past two weeks .
The warning system is based on the rate of new infections per 100,000 inh@@ ab@@ it@@ ants in the past 14 days , and the percentage of positive tests .

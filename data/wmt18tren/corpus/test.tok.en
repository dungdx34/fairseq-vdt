28 @-@ Year @-@ Old Chef found Dead at San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week .
but the victim &apos;s brother says he can &apos;t think of anyone who would want to hurt him , saying , &quot; Things were finally going well for him . &quot;
the body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28 @-@ year @-@ old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia , the San Francisco Medical Examiner &apos;s Office said .
the San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Galicia , told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank , previously a line cook in Boston , had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco &apos;s Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant six months ago .
a spokesperson for Sons &amp; Daughters said they were &quot; shocked and devastated &quot; by his death .
&quot; we are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed , &quot; the spokesperson said .
our thoughts and condolences are with Frank &apos;s family and friends at this difficult time .
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels , but recently , &quot; Things were finally going well for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he was dating a girl , &quot; Louis Galicia told KGO .
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother .
he was a kind spirit with a big heart .
his way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish , making us dinner , &quot; Louis Galicia said .
he never wanted to be in any kind of altercation .
he was the brother that went with the flow .
&quot; with everything else that &apos;s going wrong with the world , he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day , &quot; he said .
anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD tip Line at 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 4444 .
junior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the Junior Doctors Committee ( JDC ) of the British Medical Association ( BMA ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September .
the JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
in a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night , the JDC &apos;s chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained &quot; persistently silent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re @-@ negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September .
the dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all @-@ out stoppages in the history of the NHS .
the BMA &apos;s junior doctor leader , Dr Johann Malawana , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the BMA had recommended .
he had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &apos; alliance of misfits &apos; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight @-@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace , I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but Mr Putin &apos;s smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Mr Putin - five times , according to one report .
I lost count .
he also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre @-@ crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
but a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia &apos;s leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : Turkey &apos;s shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was furious .
Mr Putin lashed out , accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
rebuilding real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
Russian public opinion has also turned since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media conducted a staggering , all @-@ out offensive against Ankara .
all of a sudden , it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan &apos;s own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he &apos;s denied that emphatically .
but in St. Petersburg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan .
Russia could claim a victory of sorts .
for Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear .
first and foremost , Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup .
repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too .
there is also an economic motive .
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has slumped by almost 90 % .
as for Russia , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume .
they &apos;re banking on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
and even this week , state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
&quot; tourists that way , tomatoes back here , &quot; as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
add to that its long @-@ standing grudge at the snail &apos;s pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey &apos;s ties with the West .
the Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
mind you , that &apos;s a given for Moscow which has its own deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this glitzy , seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an &quot; alliance of misfits &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is Syria , where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched on the topic .
Turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences , while Mr Putin chose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria .
but after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
the brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank &apos;s chief executive .
royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland .
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out .
during that time , brand strategists have used &apos; RBS &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport , from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray .
but now , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore .
royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers , but will not be initialised .
in England and Wales , all RBS references , outside head office and the stock exchange listing , will be changed to NatWest .
the Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which will get more prominence - Coutts , Adam &amp; Co , Drummond , and Holt &apos;s Military Bank .
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness @-@ shire .
he told BBC Scotland : &quot; the RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , RBS became the global brand .
I &apos;m now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those brands .
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; the time is right for us to move to the bank of brands , because underneath ( we &apos;ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief executive .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we &apos;d said we &apos;re going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there .
but with the work we &apos;ve been doing , focussing on the customers needs , not our own , I think you &apos;re seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those brands back up again , so I think the time is right .
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday .
he brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection , trained by John Gosden .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing .
he follows Sir Gordon Richards , Doug Smith , Lester Piggott , Pat Eddery and Willie Carson .
three @-@ time champion jockey Dettori , who earlier won on Ghayyar , said : &quot; it &apos;s special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family are here as well
I &apos;m very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not a Royal Ascot - it &apos;s a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people .
I &apos;m relieved and very humble .
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time champion Sir Anthony McCoy , who had more than 4,300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester Piggott , nine @-@ time Derby winner , 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
he is stylish and strong , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he &apos;d have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big @-@ race jockey !
seriously though , Frankie &apos;s been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he &apos;s a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that , he &apos;s an incredible jockey .
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
from flying finishes to flying dismounts , Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades .
it has been a rollercoaster ride .
stacks of big @-@ race winners , including his famous 1996 &apos; Magnificent Seven &apos; at Ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six @-@ month suspension , but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
Russia &apos;s Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov .
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin &apos;s trusted inner circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had &quot; decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
Mr Ivanov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , Anton Vaino , has been appointed as his successor .
Mr Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations ( MGIMO ) and served in the Tokyo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the Kremlin website says ( in Russian ) .
on being appointed , he told Mr Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented .
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him .
do the smiles convince ?
this is a move that has mystified Moscow .
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest allies and , like him , served in the Soviet security service , the KGB .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request .
but despite the smiles for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall @-@ out from some kind of power struggle ?
no @-@ one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run Russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism .
in remarks to Mr Putin , quoted on the Kremlin website , Mr Ivanov said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 2012 I asked you , in a conversation , to entrust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troublesome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that I &apos;ve been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service , like Mr Putin .
in the late 1990s , when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , which replaced the KGB , Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
when Mr Putin came to power , he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional .
but that post was taken by another close Putin ally , Dmitry Medvedev .
Mr Putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years later .
criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dismissal in a joint statement .
Gibson , who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner , issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced .
there were creative differences on the set and a disagreement .
I regret that it occurred , &quot; he said in a statement .
details on how Gibson &apos;s character will be written out of the show , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma &amp; Greg , had been on the show since its first season in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years , &quot; Gibson said in a statement released on Friday .
I had hoped to see it through to the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now .
I would just like to say thank you to the writers , producers , actors , our amazing crew , and , most importantly , the best fans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September .
mystery as fish land in Banff garden
a Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff .
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout .
Mr Bain , who lives about 500m from the sea , posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two @-@ inch fish .
Queensferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fife
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing &apos;s north deck and Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife .
it is the first of four closures between the &quot; deck fans , &quot; which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge &apos;s three towers .
the bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay @-@ cables .
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017 .
economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing .
we &apos;re all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the Viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now in place , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said : &quot; the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
on this fantastic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
after installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side .
this was done by pulling the northern approach Viaduct 700 millimetres southwards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the Viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way .
happily , it all went very well .
Moelfre Bay rescue : three men are &apos; lucky to be alive&apos;
three men are &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey .
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13 : 20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay .
the three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power .
&quot; we saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst , &quot; said Moelfre lifeboat helm Vince Jones .
&quot; Fortunately , by the time we had launched , the strong winds had blown it clear of them , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man , aged 60 , was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket .
they were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured .
the boat &apos;s engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized .
someone was watching over these guys today .
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
it is fascinating to see how the world turns .
that teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more , preferring to spend their free time looking at screens , has been the lament of many for the the past decade .
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity .
screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones .
so it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive .
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s ( it later spawned a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin offs ) .
like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response , which overloaded servers .
within days , Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and nearly as many as Twitter .
so how does it work ?
in a nutshell , players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons , which are tracked with a GPS and , once found , can be &apos; photographed &apos; ( via a screenshot on your phone ) or &apos; captured &apos; .
a generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze , jumping off the couch for the search .
in the US , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
cardiogram , an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching , the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels .
many public health campaigns to get people to &quot; find 30 , &quot; &quot; get off the couch &quot; and &quot; be active everyday &quot; have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable .
yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated .
those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
activity helps with weight management , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy .
thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun .
some people are even making new friends on the hunt .
as usual there are Po @-@ faced killjoys looking for something to complain about .
and yes somebody might walk into a door .
so what ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
for while smartphone Apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to exercise like this game does .
the novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course .
however because of Pokmeon &apos;s success there will be more games that combine Apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

Simone Biles nails all @-@ around gold in women &apos;s gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
Simone Biles is immune to all of it .
dynamic on vault .
Effortless on beam .
Jaw @-@ dropping on floor .
brilliant all over .
and now , finally , an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymnast soared to the all @-@ around title on Thursday , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight .
her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and &quot; Final Five &quot; teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina .
United States &apos; Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all @-@ around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all @-@ around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same league as once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights :
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot; the greatest gymnast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
one last test awaited in Brazil , a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family &apos;s home in Spring , Texas , with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment .
United States &apos; Simone Biles , left , and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all @-@ around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi &apos;s going away party .
while Biles insisted she &apos;s never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that &apos;s not exactly true .
a portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
the girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman &apos;s mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force .
she hasn &apos;t lost an all @-@ around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to .
though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations , it was a mirage .
balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor .
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles &apos; glittery red , white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality .
Raisman &apos;s performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain the Americans call &quot; Grandma &quot; was well ahead .
she blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt .
as for Biles , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix &apos;s first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot , according to police reports released Thursday .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos; daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
the gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle , the report states .
police say the triple killing doesn &apos;t appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn &apos;t take purses or $ 2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks .
in all , seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four @-@ month period .
&quot; it &apos;s occurring within a residential area in front of a home , &quot; Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month .
the suspect is believed to have used several vehicles , including as a late @-@ 1990s brown Nissan , a late @-@ 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospitalized for her injuries and later died .
liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos; daughter Maleah died at the scene .
a witness told police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music .
authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half @-@ hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer .
investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of 6 @-@ year @-@ old with microcephaly : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most six @-@ year @-@ olds , Edmund Picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but unlike most of his peers , Edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn &apos;t know about while pregnant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , I can &apos;t do this .
I can &apos;t do this .
I didn &apos;t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it , &quot; she said .
she and her husband , Vincent , were told Edmund might never recognize them , and that he might not even survive .
some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized .
&quot; my first response was &apos; I didn &apos;t think people did that anymore , &apos; &quot; Picciuto explained .
Edmund walks with the help of a Walker .
Edmund didn &apos;t sit up or crawl until he was three , and he still doesn &apos;t talk .
but he &apos;s slowly meeting some milestones .
he &apos;s walking with help , and riding a bike .
he also loves playing with his two brothers , and singing .
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re teaching him sign language , &quot; Picciuto told CBS News .
but it &apos;s not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs .
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions : genetic ones like Edmund &apos;s , and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika .
symptoms and prognosis can vary widely .
it &apos;s too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika .
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future .
I kept saying , what &apos;s going to happen ?
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I actually haven &apos;t asked for a prognosis in forever , because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really be able to tell me .
but Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child , and your child will love you .
heavy rain , flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday , with more rain expected over the state through Saturday .
numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall , the National Weather Service reported .
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials , and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes .
Mike Steele , a spokesman for the Governor &apos;s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness , said requests were coming in for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sandbags .
Steele said Tangipahoa parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
a flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana .
the weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area .
in south Alabama , a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area .
the Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs , both in Louisiana , were predicted to set record crests over the weekend .
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge .
he also said that flooding downstream in Ascension parish is a threat , as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas .
the Tickfaw River , just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool , Louisiana , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday .
rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi .
Leroy Hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster .
Hansford , 62 , says waters from Beaver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose quickly overnight .
he said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him .
&quot; we woke up and the water kept on coming , &quot; Hansford said .
it came up to my waist .
his wife told Hansford that it &apos;s the highest she &apos;s seen the creek in the 48 years she &apos;s lived there .
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities , and he &apos;s the only one who can swim .
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military @-@ style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster , where they were sheltering Friday .
Krautmann says flooding is &quot; quickly becoming widespread &quot; as heavy rains continue , saying officials are considering evacuation orders .
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning .
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday .
heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts , authorities said .
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded .
residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding .
parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water .
shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated .
&quot; they will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede , &quot; he said .
in the Tangipahoa parish city of Hammond , close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water , and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses .
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said city administrator Lacy Landrum .
this one is on track to be a similar event .
in Mississippi , Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast .
he said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday , but none have been reported so far Friday .
Keith Townson , manager of shopper Value Foods in Amite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in some places I have never seen before , &quot; Townson said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming down . &quot;
Mahaj Brown , 6 , &quot; riddled with bullets , &quot; survives Philadelphia shooting
police say a 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy has been shot in Philadelphia , marking the second shooting of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old in the city this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown .
the grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in his groin , leg , arm and abdomen , but was awake when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; he just took a lot , his little body was riddled with bullets , &quot; his grandmother DeLores Melendez tells the station .
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries .
family tells the station he is expected to recover .
he was set to start first grade at a local elementary school .
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section .
also shot were three men : two 29 @-@ year @-@ olds and one 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to CBS Philadelphia .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter .
investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen .
assault weapon @-@ style shell casings , traced to different assault style weapons , littered the scene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were casings in the street , on both sides of the sidewalk .
so it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged , &quot; Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station .
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video .
another 6 @-@ year @-@ old , a girl , was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West oak Lane neighborhood .
she is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gabby and Laurie
that &apos;s what I call this year &apos;s Women &apos;s Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one .
first , I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three gymnasts , Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas and Lauren &quot; Laurie &quot; Hernandez , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
the make @-@ up of this team , rounded out by Aly Raisman , who is Jewish , and Madison Kocian , who is Catholic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like America .
it also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female gymnast has been African @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last Olympics , Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion , and America cheered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three @-@ time World Champion Simone Biles , Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected , yet masterful gymnastics routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women &apos;s individual all @-@ around event .
and teammate Aly Raisman earned silver .
we are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country .
Simone , Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Final Five &quot; because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team , and this is Marta Karolyi &apos;s last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the coaches and their gymnasts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business .
these clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a costly and long @-@ term commitment for the gymnasts &apos; families .
Aimee Boorman , coach of Simone Biles , and Maggie Haney , coach of Laurie Hernandez , have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gabby and Laurie .
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organizations , we have provided free and low @-@ cost gymnastics , based in Harlem , for over 15,000 urban youth ( primarily black and Hispanic ) and have trained national and international champions .
in September , we will be expanding to Detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , Aly , Laurie , Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of &quot; Girl Power &quot; in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt &apos;s proposal
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
in July , Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours .
Dr Ellen McCourt , the BMA &apos;s junior doctors &quot; committee chair , said in a statement last night : &quot; junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and , at times , deafening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address junior doctors &quot; concerns .
if he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials .
the BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
Daniel Mortimer , chief executive of NHS Employers , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
Mr Mortimer said : &quot; industrial action achieves little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , carers and their families . &quot;
over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have , along with the Department of Health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of syllabus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ a @-@ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a @-@ day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti @-@ clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack .
NHS watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now NHS watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build @-@ up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque .
if the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
Ticagrelor , which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique , reduces this risk by making clots less likely .
the draft nice guidance , published today , recommends that people be given 90 MG of ticagrelor for 12 months , followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years .
professor Carole Longson , director at the nice health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences . &quot;
fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
ex @-@ Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption , prompting the government report
a culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
ex @-@ Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police , election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; over @-@ sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former communities secretary , now the anti @-@ corruption tsar , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to whistleblowers , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London .
last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , Lutfur Rahman , should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found Rahman &quot; cynically perverted &quot; the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia .
Rahman , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
his report says : &quot; evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elders , especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over @-@ sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop &quot; vote harvesting . &quot;
the report , being considered by Theresa May , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting .
use indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person &apos;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three @-@ year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes .
give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 .
make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations ( except in Wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone .
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police , saying it is &quot; astonishing &quot; that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case .
&quot; the election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also criticises the ineffectual &quot; tick @-@ box inspections &quot; of town hall electoral registration departments .
Sir Eric said : &quot; last year &apos;s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake @-@ up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
crazy for Kate &apos;s cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand @-@ Prevot , who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media .
so , in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment , FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs .
the hunter and the wolf : U.S. Men &apos;s archery Team member Brady Ellison , left , has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
aside from Kate &apos;s doppelganger on the cycling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A @-@ lister Leonardo DiCaprio .
U.S. Men &apos;s archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the wolf of Wall Street star surfaced .
and in fact , the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid .
&apos;i personally don &apos;t see a huge resemblance , maybe besides the facial hair , &apos; Brady told Huffington Post .
&apos;He is a good @-@ looking dude so I guess it &apos;s a compliment.&apos;
one of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban @-@ American singer Gloria Estefan .
and over in the pool , South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now .
changing it up : this user reckons that Nathan is an &apos; athletic version &apos; of the inception actor
another long @-@ running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips .
silver medal swimmer Russia &apos;s Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord , while Team USA &apos;s Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an &apos; athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.&apos;
tough women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer carpenter , right , have similar face shapes and eyes
not the only one : one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
floating a theory : according to this user , perhaps there is a reason behind the pair &apos;s similar looks
one Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that &apos; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope solo and Jennifer carpenter are actually identical.&apos;
indeed , the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes .
other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh @-@ Jennings and her smile that is near @-@ identical to that of actress Laura Linney , as well as gold medal @-@ winning gymnast Gabby Douglas , who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union .
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer &apos; died like a pig&apos;
Byron MacDonald &apos;s analysis of 14 @-@ year @-@ old AI Yanhan &apos;s fourth place finish at the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC &apos;s live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14 @-@ year @-@ old female Chinese swimmer &apos; went out like stink &apos; and &apos; died like a pig &apos; during a race .
commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay final .
MacDonald , who was brought on board CBC &apos;s commentary team to provide &apos; color &apos; could be heard saying : &apos; that little 14 @-@ year @-@ old from China dropped the ball , baby &apos; .
too excited , went out like stink , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
Chinese swimmer AI Yanhan , 14 , swam the second leg of the relay in 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ruck , allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China .
viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted , &quot; did the CBC announcer just say the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swimmer from China &apos; died like a pig &apos; &quot; ? ? ? ?
the Idiot didn &apos;t realize they were still on the air.&apos;
AI Yanhan of China in the Women &apos;s 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as : &apos; that little 14 @-@ year @-@ old from China dropped the ball , baby.&apos;
criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
another Twitter user , Sarah Paradis , wrote : &apos; Wow # ByronMacDonald .
you represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists . # disgusted .
soon after , Scott Russel who was hosting CBC &apos;s broadcast apologized on @-@ air for MacDonald &apos;s comment , saying : &apos; we apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.&apos;
it was an unfortunate choice of words , we &apos;re sorry it happened.&apos;
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
fellow commentator , Scott Russel , had to make an apology on MacDonald &apos;s behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald &apos;s comments
the network was also quick to apologize and released a statement .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made , and that they were allowed to go to air .
we moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on @-@ air and to our followers on Social media .
to be clear , Byron &apos;s comments were related to the swimmer &apos;s performance , not to her as an individual .
that said , they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon , MacDonald apologized on @-@ air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn &apos;t mean for it to be construed as a personal attack .
&apos;i would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women &apos;s relay , &apos; he said on CBC &apos;s Olympic broadcast.&apos;
&apos;i was referring to a swimmer &apos;s performance , and not to them as a person.&apos;
&apos;Needless to say , there was no disrespect intended and I &apos;m very sorry.&apos;
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
shoppers didn &apos;t know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark .
to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , peeled them off and put them back on the shelf .
she carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre , Folkestone .
the Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre , Folkestone , where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
a mother @-@ of @-@ two , Jenny Davidson , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman &apos; got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.&apos;
she said : &apos; people couldn &apos;t believe what they were seeing.&apos;
standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of knickers from the display , stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on .
&apos;She didn &apos;t try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there , bold as brass.&apos;
&apos;Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn &apos;t like them because she put them back on the shelf.&apos;
she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out .
&apos;She didn &apos;t seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she &apos;d been trying on.&apos;
MS Davidson , 33 , who lives in the Kent town , said : &apos; how disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven &apos;t been cleaned.&apos;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
MS Davidson added : &apos; I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.&apos;
&apos;i &apos;d hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they hadn &apos;t been washed.&apos;
a Primark spokesman said : &apos; Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.&apos;
all the product in question has been removed from sale .
how to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
it &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to Rhon Mizrachi , New York @-@ based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation , to find out how to deal with gun @-@ toting muggers at close range .
whether you &apos;re approached from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger .
if approached from behind , Mizrachi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your attacker and &apos; clear the line of fire &apos; .
you then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow .
a knee to the groin follows , and while the attacker doubles up in pain , you twist the gun from his hands , smack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
for gunmen approaching from the front , it &apos;s a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can &apos;t fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
sounds tricky ?
check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it .
but remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you &apos;re not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash .
traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe &apos;s dirtiest places for travel guide
a British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe .
presenter and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suffolk , scraped his tongue along a Euro note , a Piccadilly Circus hand rail , a train toilet &apos;s flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system .
before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show himself , and us , just what he was getting in to .
but the experiment , which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , threw up some surprising results .
the thought of licking a train &apos;s flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
all the way along his trip through Europe , Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health .
Fortunately , nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth .
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things .
from public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
in the movie made about it he said : &apos; ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I &apos;ve put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil , eating worms and muddy water.&apos;
he certainly proved his reputation during the film .
the only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet .
his sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units .
by comparison , freshly washed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units , when freshly washed hands are less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller &apos;s film called The Lickhiker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
he said in the film : &apos; that is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.&apos;
there &apos;s nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick anything because it &apos;s disgusting in there .
the Lickhiker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio .
the company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus , which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people &apos;s gut bacteria and immune systems .
Valio &apos;s Senior Vice President of snacks , juice and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa said : &apos; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics .
we did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea &quot; let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it &apos;s linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hakala , who directed the film , added : &apos; let &apos;s put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to , like the disgusting Russian toilet that &apos;s shown in the film.&apos;
naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick , some were pretty tough .
I &apos;m glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.&apos;
in a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio , 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well @-@ being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria .
family of yobs destroyed Saltash , Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
a family of yobs left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours .
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash , Cornwall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were forcibly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair .
the walls were left with gaping holes , floorboards were ripped up , rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy , housing manager at Cornwall Housing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
she said : &apos; it &apos;s been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don &apos;t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not @-@ so @-@ nice element of Cornwall .
this family are notorious and their name is notorious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats , intimidating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shouting , arguing and swearing .
Skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the tenancy , was given an antisocial behaviour order in June .
old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demolished
floor boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
the eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
one said : &apos; they didn &apos;t care about anybody.&apos;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
the amount of times we &apos;ve seen the police down here is unbelievable .
&apos;This morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep.&apos;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
it &apos;s going to be lovely now that they &apos;re finally gone .
Adam Fitzpatrick , Cornwall Housing &apos;s neighbourhood enforcement manager , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
he added : &apos; it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness .
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information .
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s .
a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
in 2014 , police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and £ 1,700 in cash .
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son , Lee Skeldon , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
after being made homeless , it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth .
the walls of many of the house &apos;s rooms had graffiti scrawled across them .
police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow , of Devon and Cornwall Police , said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules .
&apos;This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination , as well as those blighted by such behaviour , &apos; she said .
criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal are left terrified as a low @-@ flying military jet flies skims beach
tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro , Portugal , had the shock of their lives
a Portuguese air force P @-@ 3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
the air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
this is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low @-@ flying jet swooped down over a packed beach .
dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro , northern Portugal .
holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds .
the incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon .
Daniel Fernandes , one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly @-@ by onto social media , said : &apos; it passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.&apos;
Nuno Arroja added : &apos; I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.&apos;
tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
the Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them .
he said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires , but the air force insisted no @-@ one &apos;s safety had been compromised .
wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
the plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
London schoolgirl who joined Isil killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana , one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Isil , has reportedly died in Syria .
attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa , Syria , a few weeks ago .
she was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa , the group &apos;s stronghold in the country , ITV News reported on Thursday .
Sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died just as she was making plans to flee the war @-@ torn country and return to Britain .
&quot; one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really , &quot; Akunjee said .
in February 2015 , Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border .
Sultana &apos;s family was told she married an Isil fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months .
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president .
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland &apos;s confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia .
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
a spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating .
he praised Garland and said Clinton &apos;s team would not want to &quot; rock the boat &quot; with a new pick .
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit .
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland &apos;s nomination are &quot; minions &quot; and &quot; enablers &quot; of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump .
he said Trump is unfit for office .
treats says nude calendar for &apos; women , as well as men&apos;
treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s &apos; Pirelli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they &apos;re setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU muses calendar .
treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude @-@ heavy magazine differs from old @-@ school Playboys because &quot; playboy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks the calendar is , too .
&quot; we need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women , as well as men , feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body , &quot; Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar .
women will want to be a part of this project because it &apos;s a beautiful piece of art .
models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
vinyl destination : who is actually buying records ?
Lonely , middle @-@ aged men love vinyl .
before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen , this statement derives from actual data .
according to YouGov , the much talked @-@ about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item , but by midlife nostalgia .
those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 , apparently .
in fact , those in the 18 @-@ 24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists , either - it has emotional significance : older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves ( 56 % versus 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % versus 66 % ) .
but are YouGov &apos;s results true ?
if this blog was a televised news report , the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street , wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping , cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look .
while the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels , eats , Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain .
I &apos;d probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit , in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation .
Glaswegian Stuart , 55 , whom I follow from Sister Ray ( data count : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into reckless Records ( data count : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably in her 20s ) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I suppose I am , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he emailed me the snap , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , line his living room walls .
his reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they originally came out , and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint .
&quot; a lot of the stuff I get is late 60s , early 70s , things that came out when I was 11 or 12 , things I was probably a bit too young to get , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company , adding : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke , I don &apos;t drink very much .
it &apos;s my vice .
Wez , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile .
he has , however , noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype , people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records .
from conversations I &apos;ve had , people have got rid of their collection , normally around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back , &quot; he says .
that may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types .
according to Wez , some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular .
some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve , of items that recall halcyon teenage memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort , &quot; Wez says .
as a collector myself , I have that , and I think a lot of people do .
it &apos;s an easy way to occupy your headspace .
&quot; we &apos;re like their social workers ! &quot; pipes up a co @-@ worker from a stack of records .
an ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it .
the poll also found that 41 % have a turntable they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase vinyl don &apos;t own a record player .
at this stage of the news report , I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations .
the &quot; trophy &quot; aspect of the revival is something that Jonny , 42 , who works in Sounds of the Universe ( data count : three midde @-@ aged men ) has noticed .
&quot; someone came in recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf , &quot; &quot; he says .
that &apos;s not a large percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening .
more of the product side , less of the music .
we have people saying : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
that &apos;s younger people , not older ones , late teens who are just getting into it .
Fopp , which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl , has a far more varied audience when I arrive .
there are couples in their 70s , tourists taking photos , teenage boys and middle @-@ aged women .
while the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast &apos;s latest synth- and sex @-@ fuelled pop , rather than noodling jazz , is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers .
none of them look particularly lonely , but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
Elanora , 27 , has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes , looking at the variety of records on sale .
she is window @-@ shopping , rather than on a spending spree .
she doesn &apos;t earn a lot , she says , so collecting records isn &apos;t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music by a computer or another way , but the beauty of vinyl is ... &quot; she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers : urban Outfitters .
while giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants , I observe a group of teenage girls , who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily , before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player .
to the left is a stairwell , a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele , Jeff Buckley , Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac : a mix of contemporary and classics , the essential records for any average collection .
nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration , some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; art vinyl . &quot;
but , given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more , there is little to complain about .
it is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl .
but while my findings suggest YouGov &apos;s results are accurate , in Soho record stores at least , they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality , in record shops and on online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street , flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle @-@ aged men .
Greenland shark is longest @-@ living vertebrate animal - video report

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer haircuts , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40p ) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
the Calais prefect &apos;s office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free meals offered by a state @-@ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need .
a Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops , but said the Calais prefect &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally understandable . &quot;
the judge , Jean @-@ François Molla , said the groceries , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that &quot; live in extremely precarious conditions . &quot;
he said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp &apos;s Jungle Book Kids &quot; Cafe which is run not @-@ for @-@ profit and provides 200 meals a day , English and French classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
more than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids &quot; cafe .
a letter sent to the Guardian said its closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . &quot;
two charities , Help Refugees and L &apos;Auberge des Migrants , on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer .
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
great Britain &apos;s impressive run in the rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43 @-@ 7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling , off @-@ loading , side @-@ stepping , support play , running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
defeat came with the non @-@ too shabby consolation of silver - Britain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa along the way .
the bruising beating of the Boks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
but , regardless , Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15 @-@ man team .
it may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fiji &apos;s head coach is Ben Ryan , the former England boss from Wimbledon .
it has been some journey for GB .
eight years ago , under Ryan , they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens .
here , they lost just one .
this hammering will hurt but the progress is startling .
Fiji started magnificently , bouncing off GB tackles for fun .
it was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5 @-@ 0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner .
with four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB had hardly touched the ball .
a superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man @-@ mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji .
on seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17 @-@ 0 to the bad .
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score .
the conversion made it 29 @-@ 0 at the break .
it was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s , while GB are still learning the trade .
which is pretty much how it is .
GB made wholesale changes at half @-@ time and they plugged the Fijian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first @-@ half standards was good , until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay .
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB , touching down in the left corner to make it 36 @-@ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was hard not to admire Fiji &apos;s whole joyful approach .
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn &apos;t need icing with another try in the dying moments .
the whistle went , the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf , thoroughly beaten .
earlier in the day , Fiji had beaten Japan 20 @-@ 5 in their semi @-@ final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final of one try each - Britain &apos;s conversion the difference .
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson , brother of England &apos;s 15 @-@ aside team , Anthony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal .
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach &apos;s cancer battle
there will not be a more emotive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 punishing heaves into history , Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa .
though they were the two pulling on the oars , there were three voices in that boat , the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women &apos;s pairs , the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height .
their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don &apos;t it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it alters your outlook a bit .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft , 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that &apos;s how it starts off .
rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams , who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties .
Stanning , a captain in the Royal artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her , said &quot; I &apos;ve been an emotional wreck this week , maybe that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . &quot;
it just reiterates how much this means to me , how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well .
it &apos;s been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven &apos;t lost a race in five years .
the pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
Helen was calling &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process &apos; .
it &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to do anything amazing .
we weren &apos;t looking for fireworks today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their futures .
Glover has a wedding to attend next month , her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .

the annual average inflation , measured by CPI , in the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was -0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .

Snapchat &quot; Anime &quot; Effect Is criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime , but some observers say it &apos;s racially insensitive .
with its lens tool , Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting .
the lenses are blunt , feature @-@ warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day .
any missteps quickly enter the public record .
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty .
so when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes , distorted teeth and puffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - &quot; yellowface . &quot;
and they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday , with reports by The verge and Motherboard , a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant as homage to anime characters , not as a caricature of Asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action .
others roundly rejected the anime comparison .
in an email , grace Sparapani , a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared , said that the lens was &quot; hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter &apos;s effects .
it shows that the filter isn &apos;t just yellowface , but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme .
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires .
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
and Snapchat &apos;s huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snapchat &apos;s lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user , 25 @-@ year @-@ old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday , &quot; it &apos;s much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before . &quot;
on Thursday , Ms. Zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for Medium , decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race @-@ related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat .
Ms. Zhu criticized the company &apos;s mostly white , all @-@ male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag : # DeleteSnapchat .
&quot; it &apos;s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they &apos;re able to make decisions like this , &quot; Ms. Zhu , who is Chinese @-@ American , said , &quot; or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they &apos;re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . &quot;
other observers share her view , a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
for her part , Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed , adding , &quot; I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K. &quot;
military Officials distorted Isis Intelligence , Congressional Panel Says
officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted , a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee , Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , found &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among Central Command intelligence analysts , who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State .
central Command , known as CENTCOM , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Fla . , that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , &quot; a news release about the report said .
&quot; what happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , &quot; said Representative Ken Calvert , Republican of California .
the leadership failures at CENTCOM reach to the very top of the organization .
the 10 @-@ page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command &apos;s description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from CENTCOM leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as Isis or Isil .
&quot; throughout the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a CENTCOM official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mosul , Iraq &apos;s second @-@ largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , this much is very clear , &quot; Representative Mike Pompeo , Republican of Kansas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the United States Central Command &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products to downplay the threat from Isis in Iraq .
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated .
the report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of CENTCOM intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general .
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force .
&quot; between 2014 and 2015 , CENTCOM created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on Isil and Iraqi Security Forces , &quot; Representative Adam B. Schiff , the committee &apos;s top Democrat , said in a statement .
this process , Mr. Schiff said , &quot; stalled the release of intelligence products , &quot; hurt morale among analysts and &quot; insufficiently accommodated dissenting views . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure CENTCOM analysts to fit their conclusions to a &quot; preset or political narrative . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast .
last August , The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation , opened after complaints by CENTCOM analysts .
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general &apos;s investigation continued .
but he said that &quot; experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . &quot;
the investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American @-@ led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials ) .
but last year &apos;s allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis spots .
the critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a CENTCOM intelligence analyst , Gregory Hooker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush , over many analysts &quot; objections , advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence .
last year , officials said , Mr. Hooker &apos;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , airstrikes against Islamic State @-@ held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group &apos;s finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside Central Command , The Times reported in September .
CENTCOM &apos;s commander then , Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel .
U.S. Wins 4th straight in Women &apos;s Field Hockey , setting Up Showdown With Britain
one day after scoring three goals in a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , Katie BAM scored the first two goals for the United States women &apos;s field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India , 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should be a memorable feat , but BAM , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; I have no clue , &quot; she said .
I &apos;m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain , which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan , 2 @-@ 0 , on Thursday .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six @-@ team bracket and who finishes second .
the first @-@ place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch , the leaders of the other bracket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however Saturday &apos;s game turns out , the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games .
BAM was on that team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , PA . , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youngest player ever .
she missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her teammates .
the next year , Craig Parnham , an Englishman , was named the coach , and things began to change .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; BAM said .
we didn &apos;t have the work rate in London that we have now .
we &apos;ve made a complete turnaround .
on Thursday night , BAM opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in .
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1 @-@ 0 until late in the third period , when BAM took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period .
the shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie , Jackie Briggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
she is on a roll .
so is BAM .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good place right now , &quot; Parnham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday &apos;s game .
amid the fury of the Olympics , the Zen of the Trampoline
wherever you are , whatever time it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable , a furious relay of competition and striving .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton , passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete .
you can &apos;t turn on a television , read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor &apos;s conversation in a coffee @-@ shop line without hearing about Simone Biles , Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos .
and then there is Logan Dooley .
Mr. Dooley , a first @-@ time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making , may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time , buoyed by sponsorships and feel @-@ good TV commercials , if he were a swimmer , a gymnast or even a fencer .
but Mr. Dooley , 28 , of Lake Forest , Calif . , is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally .
further from the center , partly in shadow , are those sports not universally acknowledged : air @-@ pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we will always have the breaststroke , and long may it reign .
but if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite , let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it debuted at the Sydney Games , it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all .
this may be a regional ignorance .
despite sending athletes to compete , the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men , and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women .
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year .
but there is an underdog charm to trampoline , in part because it sounds , to the unenlightened ear , fitter for clown college than the Olympics .
here I should confess that I am no expert , just an earthbound enthusiast .
it does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never @-@ ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , the two sports it essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; derives from the Spanish el trampolín , meaning &quot; diving board . &quot;
aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline , shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air , and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves ( twists , pikes and somersaults ) before eventually landing on their feet .
they are judged on execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time , &quot; according to the official Olympic program .
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
medal hopefuls must go farther , faster , up and over , in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , other times back and forth up and down the court .
they are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also , in the televised coverage , another taunting line : that of the world , or Olympic , record .
this single @-@ minded pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears .
but it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games .
from this , trampoline offers a respite .
the trampoliner &apos;s vector is up .
forward motion is not the goal .
he or she rebounds , seeming weightless as an astronaut , going up , then down , then effortlessly up again .
it is not without competition , of course , nor without difficulty , but for the duration of a routine , there is no frantic charge toward the end , no vaulting into the distance , just the dreamy , graceful suspension of time and gravity .
it is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets .
the women &apos;s qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time ; the men &apos;s on Saturday , also at 1 .
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days .
in the midst of Olympic mania , they promise a quiet , lovely moment , one likely to be overlooked in the general melee .
and if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men &apos;s gymnasts recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base .
&quot; a Generation Is protesting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a U.S. Ally
violent Protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police .
is Ethiopia about to crack ?
for the last decade , it has been one Africa &apos;s most stable nations , a solid Western ally with a fast @-@ growing economy .
but in recent months , anti @-@ government protests have convulsed the country , spreading into more and more areas .
in the last week alone , thousands of people stormed into the streets , demanding fundamental political change .
the government response , according to human rights groups , was ruthless .
witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators .
videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall .
the top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult holding this country together , and moving forward , it will be even harder , &quot; said Rashid Abdi , the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa , after Nigeria , and its stability is cherished by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in Somalia , and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy has been expanding at an impressive clip .
its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital , Addis Ababa .
and its streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government &apos;s repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dissidents effectively silenced .
many have been exiled , jailed , killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert .
but that may be changing .
&quot; if you suffocate people and they don &apos;t have any other options but to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Seyoum Teshome , a university lecturer in central Ethiopia .
the whole youth is protesting .
a generation is protesting .
the complaints are many , covering everything from land use to the governing coalition &apos;s stranglehold on power .
after a widely criticized election last year , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea ; a battle along that jagged , disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years , like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front , may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm .
several factors explain why bitter feelings , after years of simmering beneath the surface , are exploding now .
the first is seemingly innocuous : smartphones .
only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved .
even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter , as it frequently does , especially during protests , many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are .
several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests .
second , there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas , Ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic groups .
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies .
for eons , Amharas from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business , exploiting the Oromos , many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mulatu Gemechu , an Oromo leader .
the biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas .
many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military , the intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi .
Mr. Meles , a former rebel leader , was Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister for 17 years , until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could see around corners .
analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents .
&quot; the current regime lacks that ground savvy , &quot; Mr. Abdi , the conflict analyst , said .
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hailemariam Desalegn , was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles &apos;s shoes .
unlike Mr. Meles , who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner .
analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan @-@ controlled security services .
the result , many fear , is more bloodshed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005 , after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole .
in the ensuing crackdown , many protesters were killed , though fewer than in recent months , and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
development experts have praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , and measurable strides in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia &apos;s government from intensifying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , protesters in Gondar , an Amhara town , attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans , and anti @-@ Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position .
the American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble .
&quot; that , &quot; Mr. Abdi said , &quot; is a very tight rope to walk . &quot;
Donald Trump Explains His Obama @-@ founded @-@ Isis claim as &quot; Sarcasm &quot;
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group .
the clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee &apos;s ability to communicate clearly to the American public .
it also put his surrogates , who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch , in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean .
after making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night , Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created Isis .
but in an early @-@ morning Twitter post on Friday , Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic .
the post was a reversal from just a day ago , when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy Isis , the Republican presidential nominee would not have it .
the latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers .
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before .
in late July , after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , he later explained his remarks by saying , &quot; Of course I &apos;m being sarcastic . &quot;
the approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans , seeing how they play , and then &quot; clarifying &quot; one way or another depending on the reaction , &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses .
instead of toning things down for a general election audience , Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble .
a new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina , Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida .
while Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says , he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor .
but as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign , Mr. Trump &apos;s jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump &apos;s most prominent surrogates , went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday .
&quot; I think what he &apos;s saying there is legitimate , political commentary , &quot; Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump &apos;s assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State .
it is true in a sense that before Obama , Isis was an almost unknown , small little organization , he who called it the jayvee , totally wrong , and here &apos;s why it happened , because he withdrew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state , allowed Isis to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East .
ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him .
he mocked the &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television pundits who try to figure him out and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot;
some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump &apos;s excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president .
once priced Out , a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby , cash @-@ only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
naturally , it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront .
the store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014 , soap Cherie , sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes .
locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city .
the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter , &quot; New York is change , I know , but still , can &apos;t believe CBGB &apos;s is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also reinvention .
a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint , less than a mile north of the original location .
the new Verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe .
the coffee is still good , too .
leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez , a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place .
he started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost , he said he was excited to do it .
Mr. Rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine .
it even reused the lights from the old Verb .
but Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
Bacon @-@ egg @-@ and @-@ cheese sandwiches are on the menu , and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available .
there are brown @-@ rice bowls .
the cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices .
nine months in , Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars .
&quot; a lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too , &quot; he said .
on a recent Sunday , Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer .
Ms. Oliveira , 34 , used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently .
even after she moved to Greenpoint , she would still make the trek .
after Verb closed , she said , she gave up drinking coffee for a while .
&quot; I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked , &quot; she said .
now she &apos;s back on coffee , although that day , instead of her usual iced coffee , she went with a blended chai drink , another new addition .
Tom Rosenthal , another longtime customer , went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003 .
he &apos;d go before work and order the same thing without fail .
&quot; quarter past seven , every day , like clockwork , I &apos;d come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu .
these days , Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order , but sometimes he &apos;ll switch things up with the bacon , egg and cheese on an everything bagel .
Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space .
in fact , the soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb , using the cafe &apos;s cold @-@ brewed coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we still might take them up on it , &quot; Mr. Rodriguez said .
and Greenpoint &apos;s traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well .
one of these new customers translated the menu into Polish , and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome .
the new location has other perks .
a local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold @-@ brewed coffee .
there is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough .
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed .
when the new space opened , Mr. Whitt said , walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming .
&quot; I &apos;ve needed to smell that , &quot; he said .
the depressing Food of the Depression , in &quot; A Square meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after ascending to the presidency , Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office .
a Gourmand , President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup .
his menu that day was more humble : deviled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and , for dessert , prune pudding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering , &quot; Jane Ziegelman said .
her husband , Andrew CoE , added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in Brooklyn Heights , are food historians .
Mr. CoE &apos;s last book , &quot; chop Suey , &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in America , while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book &quot; 97 orchard . &quot;
their new , collaborative work , &quot; A Square meal , &quot; which will be published Tuesday by Harper , is a history of American food in the Great Depression .
showing some culinary solidarity of their own , they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg &apos;s sandwich Shop , a tiny no @-@ frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
Ms. Ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich , while Mr. CoE , 57 , had the turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable medley .
when a reporter ordered meatloaf , the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression @-@ era eating .
&quot; loaves were very popular , &quot; Ms. Ziegelman said .
there was peanut loaf , liver loaf , bean loaf .
they were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out .
imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner .
Mr. CoE grimaced .
&quot; it must have sat in your stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Depression , the American table , especially in rural areas , was an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet .
teams of women cooked for male farmworkers , and fresh @-@ baked pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. &quot; A Square meal &quot; chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
&quot; this was a time when food became a central , fraught subject for the American people , &quot; Mr. CoE said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally fraught was the new budget diet : mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples , the casserole a &quot; wonderful way to repurpose leftovers , &quot; Ms. Ziegelman noted , because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , for years the center of the American meal , became a sparingly apportioned luxury .
strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense .
in researching the book , which includes recipes , Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the dinner table , &quot; Mr. CoE said .
Ms. Ziegelman amplified : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion .
it was characteristic of a lot of the home @-@ EC recipes .
as never before or since , home economists - among them Louise Stanley , chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budgeteers &quot; and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes .
&quot; a Square meal &quot; is a feast of historical tidbits .
especially savory are the accounts of the government &apos;s response to its hungry citizenry , like President Herbert Hoover &apos;s let @-@ me @-@ eat @-@ cake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood , he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become .
&quot; he liked to eat Continental cuisine , like fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; Mr. CoE said .
he ate in almost a gold @-@ plated dining room , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was fabulously out of touch .
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , Eleanor , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach .
as the book tells it , Mrs. Roosevelt &apos;s hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that &quot; put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared . &quot;
many of the Depression @-@ era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition , Ms. Ziegelman said , and on the way science has been applied to cooking .
the couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman &apos;s mother - how she couldn &apos;t throw food away , for instance .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; Mr. CoE said .
Ms. Ziegelman recalled : &quot; she actually got people sick . &quot;
there was the cream @-@ puff incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eisenberg &apos;s , she and Mr. CoE pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called prune whip , &quot; Ms. Ziegelman said , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name .
there was no whipped cream , just prunes , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and Cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo .
surprisingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
Mr. CoE went back for seconds , and thirds .
sounding like a can @-@ do budgeter , he told his wife , &quot; Some chopped walnuts would help . &quot;
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck &amp; Co Inc , a U.S. district judge has ruled .
in June , Gilead was freed from paying up $ 200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead &apos;s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni , after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices .
in a filing on Thursday , U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead , which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in Gilead &apos;s drugs .
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left , a spokesman for the group said on Friday .
Syria Democratic Forces ( SDF ) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city .
they had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants , Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters .
&quot; the city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations , &quot; he told Reuters .
Clintons earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 , paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent .
in 2015 , the Clintons made $ 1 million in charitable contributions , mostly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $ 5.3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publisher Simon &amp; Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s running Mate , U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia , along with his wife , Anne Holton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , &quot; Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement .
in stark contrast , Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
trump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
&quot; your move , &quot; Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter , linking to the Democratic nominee &apos;s returns .
on Thursday , Trump &apos;s special counsel , Michael Cohen , told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete .
trump &apos;s critics , including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his charitable contributions , his business dealings and various other ties , including with Russia .
Clinton has pounced on the issue , releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high @-@ profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes .
on Thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan .
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , &quot; she told the crowd .
politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case .
federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal .
at a Clinton rally last week in Omaha , Nebraska , Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there , challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is &quot; afraid &quot; not of the tax @-@ collection agency but of voters .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the Clintons , who now live in Chappaqua , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent .
the Clintons &apos; 2015 return showed that , unlike most Americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low @-@ cost index mutual fund , and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $ 109,000 .

Chilli @-@ powder condoms , firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them .
the method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation , which hit upon the idea several years ago , with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion , training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals .
previously many used spears to defend themselves .
Friday is World elephant Day , which is dedicated to the protection of the animals .
&quot; since we developed the ... toolkit , we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants , &quot; Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement .
the first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a Horn .
if it is not deterred , a so @-@ called &quot; chilli cloud &quot; is thrown .
Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom , its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed .
when lit , the condom bursts open with a bang , spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air .
one whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way .
a last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air , producing a loud , bright explosion .
Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab &quot; request &quot; - RT News
a French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel &apos;s dial code , with employee citing &quot; requests &quot; from Arabic customers .
Claude Lanzmann , an author of Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah , &quot; vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ .
during his recent stay , Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and eradicated ?
Lanzmann wrote .
instead , Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center .
seeking explanation , the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he got there , Lanzmann wrote &quot; shocked him . &quot;
the hotel &apos;s clerk said that the measure was &quot; a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski @-@ Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel &apos;s code to be deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas @-@ Handelsman called the case a &quot; great shame , &quot; Suddeutsche Zeitung reports .
we were appalled and shocked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disgrace .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply &quot; caved in &quot; to the alleged demands of Arabic customers .
&quot; shame on you , &quot; another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue .
the hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations , calling what happened an &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; apologizing &quot; to Lanzmann , Der Spiegel reports .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include Israel in the fast dial list , &quot; Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .
police use tear gas &amp; rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans .
under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country &apos;s senate voted for her impeachment .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran surges 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year @-@ on @-@ year terms , according to Russia &apos;s ambassador to Iran , Levan Dzhagaryan .
since international sanctions against Iran were lifted , there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; Dzhagaryan said .
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million .
in particular , Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery , ground vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year .
last year , the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas , mostly travel , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia .
it &apos;s safe to say that last year &apos;s record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
&quot; I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan , Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
cash from İzmir to FETO - Economic News
some interesting details have started to come to light regarding the Chairman of the Executive Board of the Kavuklar Group , Abdullah Kavuk and the Chairman of the Executive Board of the Küçükbay Group , Ahmet Küçükbay , who were detained because they provided financial support to FETO .
it was determined that Küçükbay and Kavuk , who are the number 1 and 2 financial sources of FETO in İzmir , sent money regularly in huge amounts to FETO / PDY terrorist organization ringleader Fethullah Gulen by courier every month .
it was ascertained that the money sent to Gulen was not transferred via banks but sent via an organization member courier so that it wasn &apos;t put on record .
on the other hand , among the people detained and brought to court in Amasya within the scope of the investigation regarding the FETO coup attempt , 9 of them , including Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman , Fatih Altınay , were arrested and 7 of them were released on the condition of judicial control .
30 thousand liras pocketed over a 10 year term
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s &quot; reduce the interest rate &quot; appeal sets the banks in motion .
it was suggested that banks participate in the campaign stage which Emlak Konut started and which GYODER then participated in .
a suggestion was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to drop housing loan interest rates to under 1 percent as they are considered a psychological limit .
13 banks dropped housing loan interest rates to under 1 percent .
it was the public banks that launched the discount rush .
when the previous monthly interest rates , changing between 1.12 and 1.29 , are used as a base , consumers who used a 10 year term housing loan will pay less interest of between 15 and 30 billion TL with the latest adjustment .
5 OR 10 year option
so , how much of an advantage will the interest rate reduction provide to those who buy a house ?
a person who has a 100 thousand Lira , 10 year loan term , will benefit to the tune of 30 thousand Lira from the drop in interest .
a large majority of housing loan users choose a 5 @-@ 10 year term payment schedule .
interest rates are expected to drop more in the coming days .
the interest rate reduction will positively affect sales .
house sales in 2015 were 1 million 289 thousand , increasing by 10.6 percent with respect to the previous year .
sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million with the cuts in interest rates .
GYODER President Aziz Torun : it should be reduced to less than 9 percent a year
it is an important step for public banks to cut interest rates .
they paid close attention to the appeal by our President and reduced interest rates .
however , this rate should fall to under 9 percent a year .
if this cutting process continues , we are thinking of extending the 0.70 monthly interest campaign that we started for several more months .
Kuzu Group Member of the Board Özen Kuzu : our campaign may be extended by 3 months
participation also by the banks in our attempt to bring dynamism to the economy may bring about the prolongation of this historic campaign for at least another 3 to 4 months .
however , loan interest rates should fall below 9 percent on a yearly basis .
it is pleasing to see that every sector is making a sacrifice in the purchase of housing by citizens with a positive mental state just in the housing sector and real market which has not been seen in the course of history .
Polat Holding Chairman of the Board Adnan Polat : we expect full support from the banks
it is a nice move for them to call for an interest rate reduction after the appeal made to the banks from our President .
apart from that , there are a certain number of steps taken towards the revival of the economy in all sectors .
the campaigns the NGOs make , the decision the Central Bank takes and all the steps taken in this direction are for the country ...
all banks should assume responsibility .
we say to them , come , join this Mobilization , walk the same path with us and let &apos;s revive the economy together , hand in hand .
5.5 billion TL investment from Sabancı in 1.5 years
Sabancı increased its net profit in the first 6 months of this year to 1 billion 353 million Lira by growing 11 percent in comparison with the same period of last year and sales of 17 billion 166 million Lira with a 22 percent increase .
the top manager of Sabancı Holding , ( CEO ) Zafer Kurtul , stated that they made an investment of 1.8 billion TL in the first six months of the year and around 5.5 billion Lira from the beginning of 2015 to today .
Kurtul said , &quot; As a country , we successfully passed a challenging turning point recently . &quot;
he said , &quot; From now on it is the time for working and producing more for our country . &quot;
2 year stop for the ferry from Kabataş
the Kabataş ferry dock was closed to sea traffic for two years due to the &quot; Construction Works for Kabataş Square Reorganization and renovation of the Transfer hub and docks &quot; which is being conducted by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ( IMM ) .
at Kabataş shore , a modern transfer hub will be constructed to integrate sea , rail and road transportation systems .
an uninterrupted pedestrian flow will be enabled along the shore by bringing the traffic underground .
tram and funicular systems will continue to operate for a while more .
round trips will be started to ensure the transportation of people to the Taksim , Eminönü , and Beşiktaş areas .
interest rates fall , houses increase in price
a friend of mine who is the manager in a public bank sent me a message .
always the same thing happens .
interest rates drop , house prices increase .
interest rates increase , house prices drop .
he says , &quot; Here it still happens like this . &quot;
he says that he received this information because his job is related to personal loans .
he says that the contractors who entered the Emlak Konut campaign with a 0.70 interest rate have increased prices in many housing projects .
I checked to see if there were any truth to this .
the situation kind of has more minuses than pluses ...
at the time , I remembered our talk with a contractor who participated in the construction summit our newspaper organized one week after the Fethullah Terrorist Organization &apos;s coup attempt on July 15 .
the boss of a large company ...
when I heard from the contractor , whose name I won &apos;t give , he said , &quot; In fact a 10 percent increase in prices should be made , &quot; and I said , &quot; Will you do an opportunistic coup ? &quot;
after the coup attempt , contractors started a big sales campaign with 0.70 interest and 120 month @-@ terms with the campaign under the leadership of Emlak Konut .
I agree that they assumed responsibility and undertook a risk before the banks .
however , we are now acting in unity and solidarity to not slow down Turkey &apos;s pace .
the 1 @-@ month campaign supported banks by reducing interest rates .
then , no one should increase profits .
warn those who do it among yourselves .
President Erdoğan received Ömer Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received Koç Holding Chairman of the Board , Ömer Mehmet Koç and Koç Holding Deputy Chairman of the Board and Ford Otosan Chairman of the Board , Ali Koç .
having taken place closed to the press in the Presidential Complex , Erdoğan &apos;s reception took 40 minutes .
appeal from BDDK : complain to those banks
banking Regulation and Supervision Agency ( BDDK ) Head , Mehmet Ali Akben , made a statement about President Erdoğan &apos;s &quot; loan recall &quot; warning to banks .
Akben said , &quot; If the banks do a loan recall with ulterior motives by using it as an opportunity because of market conditions , we will not allow it . &quot;
we say to those who bring these kinds of complaints and this information to us , &apos; Make an application to the BDDK complaint line by giving the names on the basis of bank and company.&apos;
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned the banks with these words in the statement he made yesterday : &quot; I say that when the interest rates drop and loan opportunities are widened , a new period will open up for our country , our investors , and the banks . &quot;
I also want to declare , refrain from giving loans in this period of our state , the banks that recall loans with fictitious excuses are understood to have chosen a side .
when interest rates were 7 @-@ 8 % per annum , banks earned money from these transactions .
more than 500 thousand Russian tourists are expected
at the EXPO 2016 meeting organized in the Antalya exhibition area , Professional Hotel Managers Association ( POYD ) Head , Ali Kızıldağ , stated that Turkish @-@ Russian relations were on the right path before the July 15 coup attempt , scheduled flights started from Russia to Antalya and a certain level of revival has been experienced in tourism .
stating that the meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President of Russia , Vladimir Putin , excited the tourism sector as well as trading sectors between the two countries . Kızıldağ said , &quot; I expect that there will be many positive developments with regard to both tourism and all sectors from agriculture to food , and from construction to textile . &quot;
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries and we have traditional relationships going back many years .
he said , &quot; On the path that the two countries &apos; leaders have opened , I think we , as the sectors , will close the gap immediately and reach our goals if we make progress rapidly . &quot;
mentioning that if the coup attempt had not occurred the number of Russian tourists to Turkey would have exceeded 1 million , Kızıldağ continued as follows :
we lost one month in the period that we call high season so targets have been downsized .
even so , I think we will surpass the number of 500 thousand if charter flights start .
moreover , it may be possible that the season extends to the end of October , or even to the middle of November .
in such a case , additional flights may be added at the beginning of the year .
I suggest that this positive atmosphere will be well appreciated by Russian people .
they also have a longing for Turkey .
with this momentum , I think we can do our best to hopefully reach 700 thousand .
stating that they feel hopeful for 2017 with regard to the Russian market , Kızıldağ said that if the Russian economy gathers strength along with relations between the two countries , the number of Russian tourists may reach over 3 million again next year .
stating that domestic reservations started , little by little , with the lifting of the ban on public servants traveling , POYD Head Kızıldağ said , &quot; There has been a turnaround in cancelled reservations and new reservations have also started to be taken . &quot;
he said , &quot; We have hopeful expectations for Eid al @-@ Adha . &quot;
Kızıldağ expressed that Iran &apos;s lifting of the ban on travel agencies regarding the sale of tour tickets after the coup attempt is also a very good development and said , &quot; It would be very good if we could bring 100 @-@ 200 thousand people from Iran in 1,2 @-@ 2 months . &quot;
should those who have a current loan renew it ?
first of all , consult with the bank from which you received the loan and learn how the new interest rates will affect your loan .
have your bank calculate the cost of using a new loan with a lower interest rate and early loan closure amount ( generally 1.5 @-@ 2 percent of the current amount ) .
if you still have an advantage when you include all the costs , you can make an application for a loan with a low interest rate .
no break for the Lions !
current champions Besiktas aim to enter the new season on a high by winning the Super Cup match they will play against Galatasaray .
laying out his plans for a win , Technical Director Şenol Güneş said in the meeting with his players , &quot; We should play fast and aggressively . &quot;
he added , &quot; I expect a high pass percentage and ball control throughout the 90 minutes from you . &quot;
not thinking of leading out the players who missed training , especially Sosa , on the pitch , Şenol Güneş was reported to be hesitant about Adriano and Quaresma .
the experienced trainer tried Necip at center back in training during the week but if Adriano plays at left back , Tosic will play as a center back .
making his selection between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei , Şenol Güneş worked on set play exercises with his players .

FETO ringleader Gülen &apos;s assets were seized
in the bill of indictment prepared by Adana Chief Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , Terror @-@ Technical and Organized Crimes Investigation Bureau for providing financial support to the FETO / PDY terrorist organization by ensuring that the value of real estate belonging to FETO / PDY related people and organizations are unconscionably increased with changes made in construction plans in an unlawful way , a suit was brought against 17 suspects by Adana 2 . the High Criminal Court was sued .
1 . in the lawsuit in which number 1 defendant Fetullah Gülen is on trial for the crime of &quot; Attempt to overthrow Constitutional Order , &quot; the court board issued an arrest warrant for Gülen along with escapee defendants Ömer Ekinci , Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu .
however , the court agreed to start fugitive proceedings against the 4 escapee defendants that have not yet been caught or brought to trial .
Adana 2 . the High Criminal Court then decided in accordance with &quot; article 278 / 1 of the Law of Criminal Procedures ( CMK ) &quot; to the seizure of all assets of Fetullah Gülen , Ömer Ekinci , Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu , who are abroad in order to ensure that the suit against them remains inconclusive and who have become fugitives as they are not reachable .
with this decision of the court , real estate , land , sea and air transportation means , all kinds of rights and assets , securities , shares of the companies in which they are shareholders , safety deposit boxes , capital holdings and bank accounts were suspended .
Hüseyin Gülerce : Gülen &apos;s demise depends on the collapse of 3 stands
commenting on the coup attempt by FETO , Hüseyin Gülerce made striking statements .
the headlines from Hüseyin Gülerce &apos;s statements are as follows :
it occurred to me that they would attempt a coup and I wrote for the last 5 @-@ 6 months in my articles that &quot; they may attempt to do that but they cannot do it within the chain of command . &quot;
I did not know two things ; the first one is that it would be widespread and deep , for example , 8 @-@ year aide de camp of the Turkish Gendarmerie Forces Commander and aides of the esteemed President .
the esteemed President is the person who struggled most ; god knows he was careful when selecting his aides but their most important characteristic is unprecedented confidentiality .
they are real hypocrites .
one of the most important pieces of proof of the expression , &quot; This is not something that a retired preacher like FETO could do &quot; is the fact that it is such a deep conspiracy .
he is certainly receiving support from the CIA .
the CIA started to collaborate with this person very early .
Mahmut Övür said in 2014 that Fuat Doğu and Fetullah Gülen had a meeting at Vehbi Koç &apos;s house in 1971 .
the people who paid attention to these matters most at that time said that the relations between MİT and the CIA are in a very close period .
the USA paid the wages of our armed forces , and before we remembered this , a guy emerged one way or the other .
when we learn this is in 2014 .
after Mahmut Bey &apos;s article , there were no statements to deny it .
for example , Adil Öksüz was caught in the base , was he not ?
it is wondered who he is .
the guy went to Pennsylvania 2 times within the last 25 days before the coup attempt , and came back 2 days before .
Adil Öksüz went abroad 109 times since 2002 .
when you gather them together , this should be investigated ; it should be investigated which ones of those who are escapees now went to the USA with an excuse after March 1999 when Fetullah Gülen went to the USA .
it will be seen that they went to Pennsylvania for some reason .
however , their major contacts with the CIA can be determined from this ; Among the people to be promoted , especially in the Police Department , there are many who were sent to the USA .
it is in the Wikileaks documents ; Gülen has a foundation established and this foundation has mutual meetings with the CIA .
work has been done to show these relationships with the CIA in official records 15 years before .
I said that Fuat Avni is an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania 2 years before .
the person who worked in the Prime Minister &apos;s Office works for Fuat Avni .
however , the bad thing is the following ; this information fell to Pennsylvania as well as the CIA .
Gülen &apos;s fall depends on the collapse of three stands ; one of them constitutes the friendship circle that we call grassroots ; there are quite deeply hypnotized ones among them , they are still saying that this coup attempt is an Erdoğan film .
as I said before , the first one is grassroots support .
the stealing of the questions , the theft and violation of rightful shares damaged the grassroots support very much .
the other two stands are political support and international support .
international support still exists .
the only thing to break the political support is authentication of the fact that the tapes of Baykal and MHP managers were taken by FETO .
after July 15 , esteemed Kılıçdaroğlu is also using &quot; FETO &quot; ; everyone has opened their eyes .
Gülen is such a trickster that he says , &quot; I did not do it , those around me did it . &quot;
when he is next to me , he says , &quot; For God &apos;s sake , Hüseyin Bey , these female disciples are seeing very unusual dreams and sending them to me , now I banned it because it is not good to act on your dreams . &quot;
a voice recording appeared ; in this voice recording the speaker is Barbaros Kocakurt : Hodja , friends saw a dream , our Prophet said double up the tweets .
1 police officer became a martyr in Nusaybin
according to information received , fire commenced by the terrorists using long barreled weapons against the armored car in which there were police who were conducting their patrol duty in the Selahattin Eyyübi Neighborhood .
one police officer became a martyr and one officer got wounded when initial firing commenced .
two terrorists were neutralized in the clash after the police responded .
the wounded officer was brought to Nusaybin State Hospital .
operations are continuing in the region .
the coup plotters were stalled , TV broadcasts were not interrupted
playing an important part in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15 , private television stations continued to broadcast thanks to technical personnel in Türksat that heroically resisted the coup plotters .
see this hero , Asım Akkaya ...
stating that they entered a mental attitude of resistance after the instruction to cut the broadcast while an announcement was read on TRT , Akkaya said , &quot; I was prepared to give my right arm after thinking that my friends became martyrs in the firing started from the helicopter . &quot;
they held a gun to my head and wanted me to cut the broadcast .
I shut down only local TV .
after that I said that we need to go to the dish antennas to make them move away from the building .
I spent around 20 minutes in the section in which there are antennas .
he said , &quot; I cut some of the cables also here but did not interfere with the broadcasts . &quot;
when the coup plotters could not succeed in cutting the broadcast in Türksat , they brought experts from Samanyolu TV .
these terrorists were arrested by the police who arrived at the crime scene after 3 minutes .
indicating that the coup plotters understood that TV broadcasts were continuing when they came back to the building after a telephone call came to them around 1 hour later and that he had a close brush with death at that time , Akkaya talked about what he experienced as follows :
that night , I took over guard duty at 8 o &apos;clock .
that place was entrusted to us .
my friends were on duty in the e @-@ State and electrical system respectively .
when we met at 21.00 to drink tea , helicopters passed over us on low altitude flights .
there were several aircraft around the helicopter that made a silent and low altitude flight .
we saw their lights .
possibly , they were unmanned aerial vehicles that can take pictures .
they were flying in front of the helicopters .
I have been there for 11 years , and I called the regular army because I saw such a low flight for the first time .
after that the movement started .
while watching the news we learned that the bridge was closed .
during that time our general director gave the order for friends that were not on their shift of guard duty to come to the building .
while we were going to the regular army to get information , we learned that all the programs broadcast by TRT were off @-@ air .
TRT broadcasts were cut for 5 minutes .
I called the TRT program controller but I could not reach anyone .
our control station said that TRT broadcasts came back on @-@ air and the announcement started to be read .
our Assistant General Director , Halil Yeşilçimen , wanted TRT broadcasts to be immediately cut upon the instruction of the general director .
as TRT 3 did a wide broadcast from the channel , we started to prepare the works to cut the broadcast .
a short while ago we heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say , &quot; there is an attempt . &quot;
our director &apos;s &quot; cut TRT &quot; instruction somewhat brought us to a mental state of resistance .
we cut TRT , and after a while we heard the sound of a helicopter .
we went out , the helicopter landed and the army started shooting everywhere , everyone scattered somewhere .
we hid in a building at the back .
we were 12 people in total .
when we went back , the soldiers disembarking from the helicopter entered inside .
soldiers wounded some of our friends .
we showed up to stand with them .
at that time , I saw that they caught our general director and brought him to his knees .
the soldiers talked among themselves .
one of them said , &apos; let &apos;s shoot one of them , let them be scared.&apos;
after that they made all of us sit inside .
their commanders started to shout , &quot; Who is in charge here , I won &apos;t ask again . &quot;
especially when we heard such talk as , &quot; let &apos;s shoot one of them , &quot; we thought like this : we know nothing about our hometown but the instruction to &apos; Cut TRT &apos; came to us .
that is to say there is a resistance .
at that moment I felt that I gave up on my life .
I said , &apos; it is me.&apos;
I got to my feet up at that moment not knowing what to do .
at that moment , the only thing I thought is the fact that fire had started from the helicopter towards my friends at the regular army office .
I thought that 10 @-@ 15 of my friends became martyrs at the regular army office and I felt a kind of comfort when I thought &apos; they will kill us sooner or later.&apos;
the commander at the head of them said , &apos; You will cut all broadcasts except TRT.&apos;
there is a system in which we monitor local channels when they are going up to the satellite .
we send 80 of 200 local channels for broadcast from the room in question .
this room came to my mind .
there were no national broadcasts among them .
if I cut them and say that all of them are cut , at least support will come or help will reach us from outside .
I said I would do whatever I could do .
after all , we faced up to the fact that we won &apos;t be able to get out from there .
I said , &apos; OK , I will cut.&apos;
I cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packages .
I cut the power button going to the monitors in which we can watch the national channels .
in this way , it will be written no signal in all the screens .
I said that I needed to go to the antennas to completely cut them .
the commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers .
I opened the antenna room , one of the soldiers said , &quot; stop there . &quot;
he held the gun to my forehead .
he said , &apos; You will cut all of them except TRT , there will be none remaining , I will shoot one of you sooner or later , it will be you.&apos;
as I had already given up on my life , I said without fear , &apos; When you go , you will see that all of them are frozen &apos; , I did not say anything else .
we entered the station and I cut the local broadcasts .
we passed to the other antenna .
at that time there was a system that corresponded to around 20 national channels .
when I cut the local channels , around 20 monitors went blank .
God helped us in such a way that both of us had no difficulty when we answered and it confused them for a moment .
they believed the answers we gave .
they did not persist .
we were relieved .
after leaving the antenna they asked where the transformer was .
I said , &apos; I don &apos;t know I am a TV broadcaster &apos; , he asked , &apos; Is there an electrician.&apos;
I said , &apos; There is no electrician in the evening after working hours , if there is a malfunction a team comes.&apos;
in fact there is an electrician at that time .
it occurred to me that I did not cut the Cyprus broadcasts .
I was thinking about cutting them to stall the soldiers .
they felt relieved because they thought that the broadcasts were cut .
they did not think of looking at the broadcasts .
then the group proceeded to wait .
when they turned on the TV in the waiting area after about an hour , they saw A Haber broadcasting .
the soldier entered .
he said , &apos; My commander , A Haber has not stopped broadcasting.&apos;
myself and the commander caught each other &apos;s eye .
he said , &apos; stand up.&apos;
I stood up .
at that moment one soldier said , &apos; there are still continuing broadcasts.&apos;
he said , &apos; there are channels broadcasting in Cyprus.&apos;
I said , &apos; they are broadcasting through Cyprus , we cannot do anything to them.&apos;
he said , &apos; After writing to someone , he made us stand up and said walk.&apos;
the coup plotters escaped from Türksat by minibus .
I saw from the photos that the soldier who brought me to the toilet and gave me water was killed on the seat of that minibus .
they fired 3 times to his forehead and shot him in his cheeks .
my friends also confirmed that he was the soldier .
they called that soldier a &apos; youngster &apos; when they were with us .
possibly he was a private soldier that did his military service .
they may have executed him to get rid of him .
according to Asım Akkaya &apos;s expressions , the first police squad came to Türksat from Gölbaşı .
when the police learned that there are helicopters around and the security guards were shot at , they went to the district to get ammunition .
they came back after 40 minutes .
when the police squads came they could not see anyone at the Türksat outer security gate .
saying that the so @-@ called experts came to the building just 3 @-@ 4 minutes after the police , Akkaya said , &quot; They said to the police &apos; they called us from inside , we are Türksat personnel , we have to enter immediately . &apos; &quot;
he said , &quot; When the police asked their identity , all four people hastily grasped their phones and informed the inside &apos; we got caught . &apos; &quot;

he saw the conspiracy in Ergenekon , FETO killed him
Ankara Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office is investigating the role of FETO in the death of Special Operation Department Director , Behçet Oktay , whose case was closed saying , &quot; He committed suicide &quot; in 2009 .
the primary suspect in the investigation is the former Police Intelligence Department Director , Ramazan Akyürek , who stayed with Oktay in the same lodgings and ordered the wiretapping of Oktay with a fake name saying he is a Hezbollah Terrorist Organization suspect 6 days before he died .
it is claimed that one part of the ammunition confiscated within the scope of the Ergenekon investigation was stolen from the Special Operations Department and buried by a FETO squad , and Oktay was killed because he uncovered this .
it was ciaimed &quot; suicide &quot; for the death of Special Operations Department Director at the time , Bahçet Oktay , who was found to be shot in the head in Ankara on February 25 2009 .
however , there were many question marks .
as a result of the legal struggle by his family and family lawyers and the proof put forward by them , a murder investigation was opened 2 years later .
the gun said to be used by left handed Oktay to shoot himself was found in his right hand .
in addition , fractures in his ribs and marks from blows to his body were detected .
the suit for the murder investigation was brought in May , 2012 .
discovered near him when he died and found to have gunshot residue on his hand , Halil Kesici was the only one tried in the murder case .
he was acquitted at the end of the trial .
in jail because of another crime and having said to have been involved in the death of Oktay by sending a letter to the prosecutor &apos;s office , Nurhan Önder was sentenced to 6 months in jail for the crime of &quot; taking the blame and deceiving the legal authorities . &quot;
those prosecutors should BE investigated
meanwhile , the prosecutor Hüseyin Yalçın , who said the incident was &quot; suicide , &quot; retired while Mustafa Düzgün , who conducted the murder investigation , received a promotion .
Oktay &apos;s family wants the autopsy prosecutor , Nihat Yıldırım , to be investigeted together with these prosecutors .
Behçet Oktay &apos;s sister Şule Oktay , brother Nezih Oktay and family lawyers made many requests during the trial process .
saying that it was not possible that Halil Kesici killed specially trained Oktay on his own , the family requested an extension of the investigation .
saying that the incident was a cover up , the family requested the detection and trial of Hüseyin Yalçın , Behçet Oktay and police department officers who wanted to close the Behçet Oktay Case as a suicide .
while all the requests of the family were rejected , it was revealed that Oktay was wiretapped as a Hezbollah Terrorist Organization member with the fake name &quot; Abdurrahman Doğru &quot; 6 days before he died .
the person who instructed the wiretapping was determined at the time to be Police Intelligence Department Director , Ramazan Akyürek .
following this development , the Ankara Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , dealing with the Behçet Oktay case again , started to examine the Fetullah Terrorist Organization &apos;s ( FETO ) hand in the murder .
the case brought to the Ankara Heavy Penal Court for the illegal wiretapping of Oktay will start on September 19 .
FETO IS certainly behind this
interviewed by Sabah , the Oktay family is hopeful that the current investigation is conducted .
family members say that FETO &apos;s hand in the murder was whitewashed during the previous investigation and trial .
his sister Şule Oktay said , &quot; In fact this murder happened blatantly . &quot;
we could not perceive it .
my elder brother said , &apos; They will eat me &apos; before he was killed .
I said , &apos; Who ? &apos;
at that time he indicated FETO to me .
I thought that he would be dismissed .
I did not think of death .
FETO is certainly behind this act .
she said , &quot; At that time the management was in their hands . &quot;
he called the family of the young martyr , participated in his prayers
after addressing citizens at the Presidential Complex during the last guard watch of the evening in which a break was taken in the democracy watches , President Erdoğan called the democracy martyr university student Ömer Can Açıkgöz &apos;s family via AK Party Sinop Deputy , Nazım Maviş .

he said , &quot; I told him that health of our country and him are important for us . &quot;
&apos;YOUR health IS important for US&apos;

the traitors who shot the people were protecting PKK
it started to come to light why Turkey , in a bitter struggle to end PKK terrorism for more than forty years , could not destroy the organization leaders in this struggle .
having infiltrated the critical institutions of Turkey , FETO militants worked to cling to Turkey &apos;s wings from all quarters .
at this point today , serious suspicions and proof started to emerge that FETO is behind critical incidents like the Hrant Dink murder , the Uludere incident , the downing of the Russian aircraft .
traitor &apos;S criminal past IS lengthy
supervising the assassination operation and the raid on the hotel in Marmaris in which President Tayyip Erdoğan stayed during the July 15 coup attempt , FETO member , Brigadier General Gökhan Şahin Sönmezateş , turned out to have a lengthy criminal past .
it was determined before that Sönmezateş notified terrorists about the air operations against PKK while the planes were taking off .
in research conducted by the intelligence departments , it was determined that Gökhan Sönmezateş has a lengthy criminal past .
he protected the terrorists
it came to light that in addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK , Turkish war planes did not shoot the exact determined targets .
it was claimed that the intelligence information given by MIT regarding the point at the foot of Kandil mountains , where the squad leader of the PKK terrorist organization was located , were distorted by Gökhan Sönmezateş and the targets were prevented from being hit .
with the change to the coordinates , it was determined that the war planes that flew to destroy the PKK &apos;s leaders , hit points to the side of the targets , and so the terrorist leaders escaped .
it emerged in the intelligence Inquisition that Sönmezateş played a key role in both the distorting of the targets and by allowing PKK terrorists to escape from their places before the F @-@ 16s took off .
the cases of 37 thousand commissioned officers are going to be opened
after repelling the coup attempt by FETO members under the instruction of terrorist ringleader Fetullah Gülen , a reorganization process started in the Turkish Armed Forces and the Ministry of National Defense .
when it was understood that the questions for entry into military high schools were stolen by FETO and the military students that are not members of the organization were sent from the school through intimidation , an extensive cleanup process started .
with the latest dismissal , while 37 thousand commissioned officers remained from 39 thousand 287 commissioned officers , the clean up carried out for the generals and admirals will also be conducted for commissioned officers .
because of this , promotions will be suspended especially in the squads from lieutenant to commissioned officer grade .
an extensive investigation will be completed before the promotion .
the cases of 37 thousand commissioned officers started to be opened one by one .
FETO member soldiers will be uncovered through detailed enquiries .
the commissioned officers who have no relation with FETO will continue in their posts .
it is stated that the struggle will continue until the last FETO member is cleared from the army , the promotion of commissioned officers will return to the agenda only after the investigation .
MİT , Police Intelligence and the State Supervisory Council are conducting the investigation together .
within the scope of the investigation , research will focus on whether the commissioned officers , whose case were opened , rose in rank from non @-@ military or by finishing the military college and the promotions they earned , the places they performed their duties and their commanders .
in addition , it will be investigated whether they are FETO members or not with a detailed investigation into their enlistment period .
all measures will be taken so that the commissioned officers who do not have any relation with FETO will not be affected by the process .
if any tiny suspicion is found , that commissioned officer will be suspended from duty and brought to the judgment .
among those determined to have a relation with FETO , the ones about whom information and documentation are found , will be discharged from the army .
while all promotions are suspended , the investigation will be widened .
measures will be taken so that there won &apos;t be any vacancies after the dismissals .
if requested , those who were dismissed from the Turkish Armed Forces because of the FETO conspiracy , and the ones who were made to retire forcibly , can return to their jobs with the same equivalent positions after going through a security investigation .

Pehlivanoğlu : FETO poisoned Türkeş
having been one of the guards of MHP &apos;s founder and first chairman Alparslan Türkeş , the retired Chief Inspector , Tahsin Pehlivanoğlu , claimed that Türkeş was killed by poisoning and it was done by someone from the family in collaboration with FETO .
having always been with Türkeş from 1977 to 1997 when he died , Pehlivanoğlu said , &quot; I have not told anyone until today but I have to speak out after watching the image of that soldier removing a part from the helicopter of Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and seeing that the same soldier was among the coup plotters who were assigned the duty of killing our President . &quot;
here is what Türkeş &apos;s guard said :
we went to Germany in 1997 .
we had a check up at the headquarters 3 days before we came .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old doctor Fikret , who performed the check up said , &quot; You are like an 18 @-@ year @-@ old young man . &quot;
he said , &quot; You do not have any illnesses . &quot;
this doctor died from a heart attack 1 month later for some reason .
we came back to Ankara on April 3 .
my chief went to Amasya .
they called me and went to an engagement at the Ankara Hilton .
after leaving the engagement , Türkeş said to his chauffeur , Alparslan , &quot; Open the back window . &quot;
he never opened the window .
when the window opened , a voice like a hiccup came .
they did heart massage and electroshock at the Çankaya Medical Center .
we brought him together to the Bayındır Medical Center but it was too late .
I think that he was poisoned in Amasya by one of the family .
an autopsy was not performed on Türkeş .
his ex wife , Seval Türkeş , must have felt my restlessness , she emerged and made defensive statements like &quot; Türkeş was killed . &quot;
she should have requested a new autopsy by opening his grave .
they said it was a heart attack .
Türkeş &apos;s grave should be reopened .
was Alparslan Türkeş killed ?

he performed the martyrdom prayer unaware of the coup
relatives of 38 @-@ year @-@ old Çetin Can , who died a martyr at the Boğaziçi Bridge on July 15 night , are maintaining their composure .

explaining that they watched the news on TV in the evening after the prayer and learned of the coup attempt , Fatma Can said the following :
we got prepared and left together .
when we went to the bridge , there were some people waiting .
as soon as we entered the bridge , the tank shot over us 2 times .
we took shelter , after that we continued to walk when the tank retreated .
there was a point on the bridge at which a big bus stopped .
that place was very crowded .
we stopped there and waited for some time .
when it did not move on , we though what can we do .
Çetin wanted us to pass to the side path .
when we passed to the side path , we became an open target for , I suppose , the sharp shooter and he was shot there .
4 hours after saying that prayer , Çetin said the prayer and died a martyr .
he was not aware of the coup .
the profundity of God ...
Allah gives and Allah takes .

measures against FETO in Macedonia

noting that the organization also has activities in the media and business world in Macedonia at the same time , the Minister Çako said , &quot; It is known to the public . &quot;
Turks here do not send their children to FETO schools anymore .
we are making an appeal to our people to not send their children to these places .
he added , &quot; benefiting from the hospitality and favor of the people in the past , this structure is very well known to the public . &quot;
the sky will be the scene of meteor showers
TÜBİTAK National Observatory Researcher and Istanbul University Astronomy and Space Sciences Department Lecturer Dr. Hasan Esen said in his explanation to AA reporters that Perseid will reach the highest level at night from Friday , August 12 , to Saturday , August 13 .
stating that the Perseid meteor shower is formed when thousands of particles drift apart from the comet named &quot; Swift - tuttle &quot; from the effects of the sun and gravity , Esenoğlu explained that this situation will become a visual feast .
Esenoğlu pointed out that the Perseid meteor was discovered for the first time in 1862 and started to be seen from earth since the 1990s .
mentioning that the Perseid meteor shower can be seen in July and August , Esenoğlu said , &quot; We should watch and care about such a visual feast coming from the space . &quot;
after all , it is a natural visual feast .
he said , &quot; It will aid us in knowing the universe in a better way . &quot;
they will sparkle red when they are cold , white when they are hot
he drew attention to the fact that some of the lentil @-@ sized particles separated during the meteor shower will drop to earth , and continued as follows :
Perseid &apos;s temperature may increase up to 2 thousand degrees centigrade .
because of the heat and friction in the atmosphere , the Perseid shower produces red light when cold and white light when hot in their natural environment .
a contribution can be made by writing how many Meteors are seen on the website of the International meteor Organization .
these data carry valuable information as they are collected from every part of the world .
it will be possible to watch it all night
explaining that the meteor shower travels at a speed of around 60 km / h , Esenoğlu said that this visual feast in the sky can be well seen from places that receive little light in the northeast direction during the whole night .
explaining that more than 100 meteor showers happen every year , Esenoğlu mentioned that the Geminid meteor shower between December 4 @-@ 17 is a well worth watching natural event after the Perseid meteor shower .
poorly educated , former football player Erdoğan
the thing that spoiled the balance is the winning alliance of the populist Islamists led by poorly educated former football player Erdoğan and the highly educated followers of Fethullah Gülen , a religious entrepreneur on a wide scale , who established more than one thousand schools , tens of university and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent .
the above @-@ written statement is the translation of a sentence in an article published in Foreign Policy last week .
Western media often publish such articles in which university graduate Erdoğan is evaluated as a poorly educated , former football player and primary school graduate Gülen is evaluated as an entrepreneur with a broad perspective , and Gülen followers are openly praised .
then , on the other hand , they try to give an explanation with sentences starting with &quot; Because Erdoğan ... &quot; in their articles with the theme &quot; Why is Opposition against America and / or the West rising in Turkey ? &quot;
it is possible that the analysts , seeing the opposition against the West in Turkey as an emergent situation started during the term of Erdoğan , are unaware of the history of Turkey .
in fact , if the statistics are looked at , the first ten years of Erdoğan &apos;s term can be interpreted as a period in which the opposition against the West in Turkey decreased or remained at an average position .
likewise , good relationships with the European Union and the United States of America continued harmoniously .
there are many reasons to be counted like the facts that Erdoğan criticized Israel with &apos; one @-@ minute &apos; ; the E.U. could not put forward a clear policy over the outbreak of civil war as a result of the Assad government &apos;s massacres , and left Turkey alone in the refugee crisis ; Some figures like European Parliament President Schulz showed contemptuous behavior as in the expression &quot; Erdoğan is not our interlocutor &quot; ; An offend Erdogan competition was held and was won by the London Mayor at the time and now Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with his poem that includes many unimaginably disgusting swear words ; PKK &apos;s Syria branch of YPG is glorified in Europe by opening both exhibitions and offices while PKK members that entered from Syria to Turkey became suicide bombers and slaughtered tens of our citizens ; US soldiers in Syria wear uniforms with the YPG symbol ; its special representative for the struggle against DAESH , Brett McGurk , paid special visits to the YPG ; while the opposition groups that don &apos;t pose a threat to Turkey , such as the YPG , are left alone , all the intelligence and logistic supports are given to the YPG ; Turkey &apos;s struggle against DAESH was underestimated and the number of our troops was decreased in Mosul because of Baghdad government oppression and USA support .
let &apos;s say that we forgot the fact that while we lost 247 people as a result of the bloody coup , there was no support for our democracy from our so called allies from E.U. countries and the USA until the failure of the coup was proven ; Kerry said that they expect the establishment of &quot; peace and stability in Turkey &quot; and did not emphasize the democracy and the elected government .
how can we forget that when 11 Charlie Hebdo employees were killed in Paris , many leaders around the world including Turkey participated in the protest march but there is no &quot; ally &quot; of the President of Turkey from Western countries that came in spite of the fact that one month has passed from the coup attempt in which 247 people resisting the tanks for the sake of democracy were killed ?
what can we say about the fact that lower rank representatives were sent by leaders who came several times or sent higher rank representatives over the matter of refugees ?
how can we evaluate the fact that all the E.U. and USA ambassadors paid a get @-@ well visit when the window of the Hurriyet newspaper was broken but they have not paid any solidarity visit to the bombed Turkish Grand National Assembly ?
when is remembered is that the E.U sent high ranking representatives and shook hands with the coup leader Sisi within the first two weeks of the coup that took place in Egypt , and Kerry glorified the coup leaders by saying , &quot; democracy is re @-@ established &quot; in his visit after the coup . is it too abnormal that when the Western countries , abstaining from supporting Turkey in the resistance of democracy , express that they are concerned about Turkish democracy , it is not found to be sincere in Turkey ?
in fact , it is sufficient to infuriate Turkish people by even allowing Gülen , who is considered responsible for the coup by 95 % of the people , to live freely in the USA .
when we add the background stated above , I think it is clear that the opposition towards the West / USA is not a situation that can be explained only by Erdoğan .
again , Erdoğan still has not even said that he thinks the USA had an impact on the coup ...
so it means that the ballot box is not an unimportant detail by no means
do the Gezi minded people , underestimating their people , saying , &quot; the ballot box is an unimportant detail &quot; and humiliating the voters that do not think the same as &quot; ignorant people that scratch their belly , &quot; sing from the same song sheet after the July 15 night ?
I wonder whether they searched for an answer to the question , &quot; Where were we mistaken ? &quot; after seeing that these people protected the state and democracy .
but there are so many questions to be answered .
being traitors after having served in various ranks until yesterday and receiving the right to use the weapons of the state , the commissioned officers accepted in an instant to enter the status of &quot; traitor &quot; and requested asylum from foreign states .
we should see what kind of a mentally deformed environment we live in and how the obsession against the people lead people to the behavior that can be described as heresy .
Brainwashed when it comes to coup attempt ...
was there any viewpoint other than likening Turkey &apos;s cities to Syria &apos;s cities for those who participated in this movement ?
why does a commissioned officer bomb the parliament of his own country ?
we should not have fallen into the error of expecting reasonable behavior from people brainwashed with the maledictions of FETO .
others are responsible But we should know FETO is not the only one responsible for everything .
the people who present politics as an occupation of quarreling , grudges , and hatred made the necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced .
the reckless people who present themselves as &quot; enlightened &quot; make the masses believe that all kinds of anomalous behavior , or even impudence , is natural .
finally , we saw how the people who hate their own people commenced fire against these people when they received a gun .
the way of democracy , the way we know
I am saying a simple thing : the people in Turkey lost 250 martyrs to the FETO member parasites , waylayers and instigators within the army and established democracy rather than lose it on the evening of July 15 .
behind July 15 , there are three periods ; 1992 @-@ 2002 ; 2002 @-@ 2012 ; 2012 and after .
there are three changes prepared in these three periods : economic , social and political .
two big phenomena prepared the social change : immigration from rural areas to metropolises and movement of these migrants to the centers after being kept on the outskirts of the cities for a long time .
I stated on Wednesday that this movement happened via the metro .
I also said , &apos; do not underestimate the metro &apos; and stressed that it is the most important social change factor .
the second biggest change in the same direction is bridges and roads .
the contribution of roads and bridges to the modernization is more easily understood .
a road is introduced , economic and social structures change .
in our case , it also changed the political structure in the same way .
I determined all along this history of the bridges that were constructed across the Bosphorus in İstanbul .
Demirel built the Bosphorus Bridge .
this was the peak of the post @-@ 1950s peasant movement in the 1960s .
Özal continued the progress in this direction with the second bridge , the name of which has changed to July 15 Martyrs Bridge .
even the routes of these roads show the relationship established between the periphery @-@ center .
it is the sign of what kind of a social change path is followed .
Demiral and Özal &apos;s aim was to melt the big masses in the center .
it was to make them adopt the ideology of the center .
the AK Party did not build the third bridge for many years .
because the immigration continued at full speed .
the incoming people were placed in the satellite cities .
a somewhat closed system was created in those regions .
the AK Party &apos;s local management gave the people food , jobs and social status ; they gave their vote to the AK Party .
in this way , the masses acquired their political awareness on the periphery and then came to the center as &quot; themselves . &quot;
this development is related to the ongoing discussions about the headscarf before the AK Party ( 1992 @-@ 2002 ) .
these discussions accepted the necessity of conservative , mutual , and provincial people not to be centralized but to stand side by side .
after 2002 , the AK Party acted with the method I stated , politicized the masses , integrated them into the politics and matured them .
after that , now pay attention to this , 3 . bridge construction is simultaneous with the democratic struggle on July 15 .
that is to say , history and sociology overlapped .
let me add one more dimension : AK Party &apos;s move I mentioned is not limited to İstanbul &apos;s bridges .
a more interesting thing happens : now the AK Party is integrating peripheral cities with central cities .
this is ensured via two bridges .
the first one is Osmangazi Bridge .
the second one is Çanakkale 1915 Bridge .
add roads to this .
Turkey will reach İzmir from Thrace via another route now .
do you know what this means ? İzmir will become an utterly different city from now on .
let &apos;s say that the AK Party will win İzmir from the &apos; outside &apos; , as it could not win from the &apos; inside.&apos;
from now on , the cities of Bursa , Çanakkale and Thrace will be transformed into other human and social geographies .
that &apos;s it !
the July 15 martyrs are the stars of this big adventure .
happy training in Fenerbahçe with Van Persie
Fenerbahçe continued preparations for the Grapphoppers match with training in the morning .

Fenerbahçe will continue preparations with training this evening .
that person who made a complaint to Gülen about Aziz Yıldırım ...
new developments took place regarding the Match @-@ Fixing Operation against Fenerbahçe .
participating in a TV program broadcast on CNN Türk , and explaining that this operation was made by FETO , the journalist Hüseyin Gülerce said , &quot; Someone from the sports world conveyed to Fethullah Gülen the remarks made by Aziz Yıldırım about him . &quot;
one day , Yıldırım expressed some words to this person like &quot; What are you doing with Fethullah Gülen . &quot;
when this person conveyed these remarks to Gülen , Fethullah Gülen became obsessed with Aziz Yıldırım .
why did he become obsessed with Aziz Yıldırım ?
with the idea that if the president of the club that has the biggest number of supporters is in this state of mind , he may damage himself .
he expressed , &quot; The Match @-@ fixing case was to eliminate Aziz Yıldırım . &quot;
after these words , another explanation came from Faik Işık , who is one of the most important lawyers in the Match @-@ Fixing Case .
Işık participated in the TV program Karşıt Görüş broadcast on Habertürk , and announced the person who complained about Aziz Yıldırım to FETO ringleader Fethullah Gülen .
here are the remarks of Faik Işık :
Aziz Yıldırım said something to İhsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen .
in a private plane while traveling from Azerbaijan .
Mr. Aziz is a witty man , he also speaks with stinging expressions when criticizing someone .
these stinging expressions can sometimes draw blood .
some people may show a reaction to these expressions .
these expressions are conveyed to somewhere .
businessmen bringing towels and offering favors and money as if they were going to Hajj , Umrah , cannot be tolerated .
he says what the hell it is , he criticizes very severely .
the only problem is not this for sure .
meanwhile , a football team pick was organized .
direct relationships between some football players and managers from Galatasaray and Hakan Şükür ...
Muharrem USTA : match @-@ fixing is different
Trabzonspor President Muharrem USTA offered a friendly hand to Fenerbahçe .
explaining that Turkey &apos;s issue is the issue of all the clubs , USTA said , &quot; We are on the side of this country with 79 million . &quot;
we should maintain a strong stance .
if there is a problem of Fenerbahçe with FETO , if an injustice is done to someone , I will also stand behind Fenerbahçe .
he said , &quot; However , the matter of match @-@ fixing between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different . &quot;
the price of sacrificial animals was announced
Karabulut said the following : &quot; we , as the Union , determined the kg price of living sacrificial calves as 18 lira . &quot;
he said &quot; We determined the kg price of living heifers as 17 lira and the kg price of living cows , we define as the second class , as 15 lira . &quot;
drawing attention to the fact that the animals not to be sacrificed last year were put on sale , Karabulut talked about the things that citizens should look at when buying a sacrificial animal :
it is necessary to pay attention to the ear tag of the animals .
moreover , it is also very important that the animal is healthy .
to do this , our citizens can check the vaccinations in the animals &apos; passport when buying a sacrificial animal .
in terms of outer appearance , the sacrificial animal should be lively and fresh , and it should have lost its baby hair .
there should not be any indications like saliva , slime on its face .
we saw that animals that were not sacrificial last year were put on sale and sold .
a sacrificial animal needs to be 2 years old .
we understand this by looking at the animal &apos;s teeth .
teeth that we describe as &quot; cap &quot; must have grown on an animal that is 2 years old .
however , these teeth have not grown on younger animals .
the animal may look old in appearance but its cap teeth may not grow .
as the cap teeth are bigger than the others , they are immediately noticed .

striking expressions from Robert Amsterdam about FETO !
an official from the Amsterdam &amp; Partners law company which juristically investigates the internationally illegal activities of the Fetulllah Terrorist Organization ( FETO ) , Robert Amsterdam shared information with the USA magazine Forbes by writing an article about how FETO is organized .
stating that FETO ringleader Fetullah Gülen manages the organization from his mansion in Pennsylvania , Amsterdam stated , &quot; When we look closely at how Gülen operates around 150 charter schools in the USA , it will be clearly seen that the organization has a secret underground organizational capability of the highest degree . &quot;
explaining that he was tasked by Turkey with the duty of investigating Gülen connected companies and schools seven months ago , Amsterdam stressed that their findings until now are &quot; shocking . &quot;
Amsterdam shared the following opinions in his article :
according to the information we received from the denunciators , the Gülen organization has a rigid hierarchy in which instructions are conveyed .
these instructions are generally conveyed to Poconos during face to face meetings with Gülen .
on the top , there is a management group ( consultation group ) consisting of seven people .
this group conveys the instructions to the advisory committee .
from this , the instructions go , respectively , to regional imams , country imams , regional imams within the country , provincial imams , regional imams within the provinces , neighborhood imams , imams of the student houses ( houses of light ) and the students .
the businessmen , bureaucrats and commissioned officers are working at various levels in accordance with their position in the organization and their support .
stating that the organization opened 55 thousand places of business all over the world and has the widest charter school network , Amsterdam said that millions of dollars are given to these schools from the taxes paid by American taxpayers every year .
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money is directed by the organization members and transferred to the &quot; chosen &quot; subcontracting companies .
Amsterdam explained this process with these examples :
Magnolia schools , established in California , was caught while giving 700 thousand dollars to a Gülen connected company , with which it shares the same office , in return for the service contract .
Amsterdam showed Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example .
Amsterdam noted that also this school paid 3.1 million dollars more to the landlord , and it was determined in the audit that the management of the school and landlord consisted of the same people who are connected to Gülen .
drawing attention to the fact that there are similar situations in Harmony schools , which have 46 branches and occupies the biggest place in the Gülen network , Amsterdam stated that money was paid to the Gülen connected smaller companies for such items as software licenses , receiving of the curriculum .
underlining the fact that the structures within FETO make each other rich , Amsterdam said , &quot; The examples I gave show that around 28 million dollars from American taxpayers are misused . &quot;
he added , &quot; moreover , this is the visible part of what we found up until now . &quot;
indicating that nothing was done to prevent this kind of thing up until now , Amsterdam said that the situation got much worse over the course of time , and upon this , the Texas Education Agency started to investigate the irregularities .
Amsterdam stressed that the schools operate normally on the surface , and many employees do not know anything about the kind of corruption taking place .
Amsterdam said , &quot; However , in fact , these schools work like a profit machine for Gülen . &quot;
he deduced , &quot; Gulen then uses the huge amount of money for political donations to conceal his illegal activities . &quot;
saying that , according to statements from a former American educator who worked in these schools , some employees in Gülen schools had separate meetings and transferred an amount from their wages to the organization , Amsterdam said , &quot; It is believed that Gülen members in the Turkish Armed Forces are working in a similar way . &quot;
coup plotters strengthened their position over the years .
he wrote , &quot; However , while the army operates in a normal way on the surface , a parallel power was collecting power behind the scenes . &quot;
Amsterdam finished his article as follows :
there are question marks in the minds of the policymakers in the USA about July 15 @-@ 16 and the incidents after that and this is an expected thing .
however , those in state authorities should realize that USA laws are violated serially in Gülen &apos;s operations while dealing with the situation of the two allies on the diplomatic level .

I need to go to the other small markets in the area to obtain other food .
he said , &quot; Also , I have a raft for 8 people which I made from the plastic bottles . &quot;

an investigation was conducted in the houses of Hakan Şükür , now in the United stated of America , and his father Selmet Şükür , in Adapazarı and Sakarya .
Selmet Şükür could not be found in spite of the investigation .

Gökhan Şükür went to the front of the Police Department in his car by following the squad car in which his father was brought .

examining the application of the Prosecutor &apos;s Office , the Vacation Peace Court made a decision for the seizure of Hakan Şükür and his father Selmet Şükür &apos;s real estate , land transportation vehicles , bank and other financial institutions accounts , all the rights and receivables at the real and legal entities , negotiable instruments under their responsibility , partnership interest in the companies , remaining balances in the safe deposit box and other assets of value .

be careful of this children &apos;s habit
Faculty of dentistry Associate Prof. Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children turn sucking into a necessity and relax through this reflex because they cannot chew at an early age .
explaining the reasons why the thumb sucking habit is seen in children , Associate Prof. Dr. Giray said , &quot; thumb sucking is a circumstance seen from birth until 3 @-@ 4 years of age . &quot;
most babies suck their thumb .
sucking their thumb to satisfy their need of sucking in infancy , children suck their thumb after 1 @-@ 1,5 years of age to eliminate the mother &apos;s breast and to relax .
he said , &quot; They may have the behavior of thumb sucking for playing around when they get bored , when they become sleepy , restless and when they get separated from their mother . &quot;
stressing that inadequacy in the relationship between mother @-@ child and underdevelopment of the child &apos;s feelings of trust lie behind the thumb sucking behavior seen at an early age , Associate Prof. Dr. Bilgin Giray talked about the effects of this behavior to dental health with the following words :
thumb sucking has a negative effect on the shaping of the dental structure of the child .
as a result of the pressure that takes place while sucking , the upper teeth are pushed forward and the lower teeth are pushed back .
it causes the lower jaw to be located at the back and upsets the balance between the palate and tooth .
the physiological reflection of this is speech disorder and a bad appearance when closing in terms of aesthetics .
drawing attention to the fact that a more complex treatment process may be experienced at 6 @-@ 7 years of age when permanent teeth start to grow if an early solution is not found , Associate Prof. Dr. Giray said , &quot; We can protect our children from closure and joint problems before the development of the jaw is complete . &quot;
he finished by saying , &quot; For this reason , at the present time , the structure of children &apos;s mouths also should be kept under control the same as eye and hearing controls . &quot;
a new push for near vision treatment : Trifocal lenses
after the treatment of cataracts , patients naturally do not want to use glasses .
Multifocal lenses have already been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients .
the success of the treatment in this area is taken further with trifocal lenses , which started to be used recently .
the difference of trifocal lenses from other lenses is their ability to provide clear vision at not only long or close distances but also in distances that can be defined as intermediary distances .
the treatment of long , close or intermediary distance vision disorders
intermediary distance in vision disorders represents a point we frequently use in our daily life .
for example , the display panel of cars , portable computers we hold on our lap or the distance we define as 60 @-@ 70 cm , arm &apos;s length , are intermediary distances .
thanks also to the correction of intermediary distances by trifocal lenses , our patients do not need to use glasses under any circumstances , whether close or long .
another advantage provided by trifocal lenses is that they reduce nighttime complaints .
Optometrist Assistant Prof. Dr. Volkan Hürmeriç said , &quot; Applied for all distance vision treatments , trifocal lens treatment has no difference from normal cataract treatment . &quot;
our patients , to whom we applied trifocal treatment , recover their eye health easily with a 7 @-@ 10 minute procedure .
and our patients can return to their normal life the next day .
it is an operation that raises the quality of life especially for people who use a car , use a computer a lot , love reading , and have a more active life .
you can consult an optometrist to learn whether this procedure , which can be applied to all patients over 18 years old , is also appropriate for you or not .
Varicose veins are not used in heart operations !
Varicose is a disease which is increasing in frequency in recent years .
primarily affected by genetic proximity , long working hours , jobs that require standing for a long period and sitting for a long period have caused an increase in complaints of varicose .
can the veins be used in heart operations ?
the questions like , &quot; I have varicose , what is done if I have a heart attack in the future ? &quot; are frequently asked by people .
here are the answers to these questions .
there are two types of vein system in the legs :
1 . in the leg , there is a vein system that we call the main path which carries venous blood to the lungs and collects the main venous blood of the leg .
these are named the deep femoral vein and superficial femoral vein .
these problems in the veins are seen less often , the vessel cannot be closed during illness and medical treatment is applied to keep these veins open .
in the leg , there is a superficial vein system which we refer to as the lateral pathway that carries venous blood to the lungs and integrates with the deep vein system in the groin .
this system consists of two big and two small veins we call saphena .
deficiency and varicose grow in all of these four vessels .
the veins , which can be used in heart operations , are the superficial veins called big saphena .
a lack of these vessels does not cause any harm to the body and for this reason , they can be used in heart operations .
however , the vessels should be healthy for these vessels to be used in a heart operation .
because the heart is a vital organ .
the operation of removing varicose veins or burning with a laser by leaving them in place via an operation reduces the workload of deep veins and ensures that the leg is healthier .
it is wrongly believed among people that the vessels can be used as a spare even if they have varicose .
Varicose veins are never ever used in heart operations !
there are other vessels that can be used in heart operations .
the spare vessel systems that can be used in heart operations are under the rib cage , around the stomach and arm .
therefore , keeping varicose veins to use for the heart and worries about this issue are groundless .

a meaningful message from Özbek before the Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President , Dursun Özbek , published an announcement before the Super Cup Final to be played between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş .
here are the words with which Dursun Özbek drew attention to the unity and solidarity in Turkish football :
two well @-@ rooted and favorite clubs in Turkish sport , Galatarasay and Beşiktaş will compete for the Super Cup in the Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena on the evening of August 13 , Saturday .
this match is neither the first nor the last match in a competition where two more outstanding clubs are left behind .
it is a vital match in terms of timing .
as you all know , our country survived a big crisis on July 15 night .
the coup attempt by the Fetullah Terrorist Organization / Parallel State Structure ( FETO / PDY ) , which intended to kill our democracy , was thwarted thanks to the unity and solidarity of all factions of our society .
we as a nation paid a heavy price that night .
we lost martyrs .
we have many veterans .
this heavy cost once more reminded us of the merits of democracy and the necessity and importance of the fact that peace should dominate these lands , not fighting .
that night , all the representatives of Turkish sports objected to the coup with one voice and heart ; they stood together with democracy .
we need the unifying power of sports more than ever at this critical time .
corresponding with the 2nd anniversary of the death of our esteemed rival &apos;s dear President , Sülayman Seba and just before the new football season that carries the name of our club &apos;s legendary captain , Turgay Şeren , I hope this match will be the match that starts an environment of love and peace in Turkish sports .
I wish that the winner will be our country and Turkish sports whatever the score is at the end of the match to be played in front of tribunes which will be equally shared by the supporters of Galatasaray and Beşiktaş .

Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland &apos;s Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men &apos;s team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012 .
the Glaswegian 23 @-@ year @-@ old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit .
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds .
and they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March &apos;s Track World Championships in London , despite Hoy having since retired .
the issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist Starter Jamie Staff .
they did so just in time as Hindes emerged .
Hoy &apos;s retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill .
Skinner was the man Britain &apos;s coaches stuck with , seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised .
Hindes , Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying , but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the duel for gold .
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap , but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and , in particular , Skinner to keep pace .
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner , Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Skinner , from Glasgow , said : &quot; it &apos;s a flattering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there &apos;s no better way to win it .
after triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy , Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain &apos;s rivals .
there was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
Hindes said : &quot; it felt like London , with all the GB flags in the stand . &quot;
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we &apos;ve been losing out on so many world titles , so to win the Olympics again is just amazing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits .
with the form Kenny demonstrated , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy &apos;s feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games .
that would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy , who is also born on 23 March ( that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah and Roger Bannister ) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as Hoy &apos;s .
Kenny next competes in the sprint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bolton said : &quot; I &apos;m just enjoying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your mates .
it &apos;s a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest .
Hindes said : &quot; if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a knighthood . &quot;
it was the day &apos;s only medal event , but there was further good news for Britain .
Sir Bradley Wiggins , Ed Clancy , Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four @-@ man , four @-@ kilometres team pursuit .
they finished in 3 : 51.943 .
the world record , set in winning gold at London 2012 , is 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and final ( 10.42pm ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where Wiggins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride , when officials summoned him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s event , which resumes and concludes tomorrow , Laura Trott , Joanna Rowsell Shand , Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time , clocking 4 : 13.260 .
team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals .
after truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London , expectations have been played down in the lead @-@ up to Rio .
there have been dramas in the background , not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations , and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton .
however , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s racing in the velodrome , it looks like GB &apos;s now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
Portland smelter &apos;s future in doubt with axing of power contract
the future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant &apos;s owners is to terminate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be axed .
the move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20 @-@ year fixed subsidy expires in November .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa &apos;s Portland plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional knock @-@ on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria &apos;s entire electricity output .
in 2014 , Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant .
Alcoa &apos;s Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
AGL , which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina , with China &apos;s CITIC and Japan &apos;s Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares .
&quot; AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue , &quot; it said .
AGL said the contracts are so @-@ called &apos; hedging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
&quot; as such , AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 187 million in &quot; anticipation of a termination event . &quot;
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect Alcoa &apos;s ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter . &quot;
the US company said it entered into a 20 @-@ year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , AGL &apos;s head of operations , Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts .
if both of those plants go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
and as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good for us , &quot; he said .
not just a Kardashian reality TV star , Kendall &apos;s on the cover of September &apos;s Vogue
Kendall Jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of mother @-@ manager Kris &apos;s Kardashian @-@ Jenner clan , is on the cover of US Vogue &apos;s coveted September issue .
Kendall , who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan , Paris and New York fashion weeks , announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room with a bunch of people I love , looking at this cover made me cry , &quot; Kendall wrote .
the cover revelation was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians @-@ esque ? ) , scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian @-@ Jenner family ( bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn , and joined by everyone &apos;s favourite showbiz uncle , keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest ) forgetting about their sister &apos;s cover , only to end with the classic twist : they were all planning a surprise party .
it &apos;s the cliche plot line of nearly every &quot; birthday &quot; episode of a children &apos;s television show ( Seacrest delivers the line , &quot; You thought we forgot about you ? , &quot; with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot ) , but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow .
because , with a spot on Vogue &apos;s September issue , we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian .
Kendall &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue ( she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014 ) , but the magazine &apos;s September cover is a league unto itself .
the September Issue is Vogue &apos;s highest selling edition of the year .
with a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers ( Fashionista counted 615 of last year &apos;s 832 @-@ page Tome as advertising content ) .
the revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that , in the past two years , pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement .
previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell , Linda Evangelista and Kate moss .
in recent years , the cover has certainly featured more &quot; celebrities who model &quot; than &quot; models who are celebrities . &quot;
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013 , the year after Lady Gaga had the honour .
but , even on the off @-@ chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakout model &quot; of her generation - falls into the former category , she is in pretty good company .
these celebrities are not relatives of famous people , or reality stars , or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video ( although Jenner is all of these things ) .
they are legitimately talented women , excelling in the entertainment industry .
Beyonce , who appeared on last year &apos;s cover , has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of lemonade .
of course , not everyone is pleased about Jenner &apos;s success .
with her reality television history , Jenner &apos;s position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught .
in June , original Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid , calling them the &quot; bitches of the moment . &quot;
this sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner &apos;s Vogue cover appearance .
but dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point .
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue .
she is a supermodel , in the purest sense of the word .
she &apos;s walking for Marc Jacobs .
she &apos;s selling you Estee Lauder foundation .
she , and all of her sisters , are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled Apps .
she &apos;s selling pictures of Cindy Crawford &apos;s daughter she photographed to love magazine .
and , in her downtime , possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids , she &apos;s on reality television .
community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the nation &apos;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already @-@ stretched operations .
in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are bracing for further cuts .
from June next year , those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; Queensland &apos;s community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crippling debts , families going through separation , workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they &apos;re not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the Attorney @-@ General , and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;re faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities , and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work .
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
new York : Donald Trump &apos;s campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February .
the incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini , a former software trainer for the state campaign .
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
the director , Earl Phillip , &quot; produced a pistol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and drove the barrel into Vincent &apos;s knee cap , &quot; Bordini said in the complaint .
after complaining to local and regional campaign leadership , Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip , according to the filing .
&quot; guns don &apos;t have to fire to inflict damage , &quot; Bordini said in the complaint .
the suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second Amendment people &quot; -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges .
trump &apos;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn &apos;t advocating violence .
Bordini &apos;s complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision , and from Phillip for assault , battery and infliction of emotional distress .
trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn &apos;t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful .
WCCB , a local news affiliate in Charlotte , reported Phillip recently left the campaign .
a call left at his consulting firm , Innovative Consulting Services , wasn &apos;t immediately returned .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign .
the case is Bordini V. Donald J. Trump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14300 , General Court of Justice , Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .

they were inspired by Bordum and made a &apos; model village &apos; in Sivas
under the Gölova district of SİVAS , Canköy was made a &apos; model village &apos; by the District Governorship and a benefactor businessman .
in the village where the streets were asphalted and paving stones were laid on the pavements , all the houses were painted in blue and white colors , taking the Bodrum District of Muğla as a model .
Gölova District Governorship prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages under the district .
in this context , the model village was selected as Canköy , which is 12 km from the district center and has 66 dwellings .
village roads , in which infrastructure and superstructure services were increased , were asphalted and its pavements were covered with paving stones .
the village houses , having many different color tones , were painted with the support of the businessman Selahattin Ayan who is the owner of Pelit pastry shops .
all the village took the form of buildings painted with white and blue colors .
Bodrum was taken AS A model
giving information about the work , Gölova District Governor , İsa Erat , stated that they prepared this project to put their signature under works that create a role model for other villages and said , &quot; A more modern view of the village and the color unity of all the houses are one part of our project . &quot;
while starting this project , we searched for a place to take as a model .
when we went to Bodrum , the view of the houses painted white with blue windows came to our attention .
we wanted to take Bodrum as a model because of the white color &apos;s cleanliness and its positive effect on the people .
we performed our work and got all the houses in Canköy painted in white and blue colors .
this work happened with cooperation from the state and a benefactor .
the project cost around 200 thousand lira .
with this work , Canköy in Sivas looks like a little Bodrum .
we want to continue this kind of work with our budget and the support of our businessmen .
66 @-@ year @-@ old Abdullah Macit , Canköy president , said that the village gained a fresh new look with the support of the District Governorship .
Macit stated that being a model village pleased both them and the village people very much , and thanked everyone who contributed their efforts .

wealth fund , audit of which is discussed , is in the committee
expected to rank among the biggest funds in the world , Turkey &apos;s Wealth fund was removed from the bag bill in a quiet and retiring way upon the objections .
it was decided that the fund would be discussed again because of the lack of an audit mechanism , but it was discussed in the committee without any amendment .
evaluating the bill of law about Turkey &apos;s Wealth Fund brought by AKP to sozcu.com.tr , CHP Deputy and Planning Budget Committee member , Utku Çakırözer , said , &quot; We are certainly against keeping this structure , which will consist of public assets , obligatory retirement deductions from laborers and workers and the unemployment fund to be collected for the unemployed , out of the Constitutional audit mechanisms . &quot;
prepared by the government to provide long @-@ term funds for investments and projects , Turkey &apos;s Wealth Fund bill of law was removed on Tuesday from the bag bill with the opinion of the opposition that it should be discussed separately .
however , AKP brought the bill to the Planning and Budget Committee in the same form .
Utku Çakırözer , CHP member of the TBMM Planning and Budget Commission and Eskişehir Deputy , talked to sozcu.com.tr about the worries and concerns of CHP with regard to the Wealth Fund bill of law .
Çakırözer said , &quot; When the establishment of this fund came to the Planning and Budget Committee in the bag bill , our former Minister of Finance at the head of the CHP delegation , Zekeriya Temizel , expressed our worries and concerns and suggested the removal of it from the bag bill and detailed discussion of it separately . &quot;
the government , accepting our opinion , withdrew the bill .
the bill came to the committee in the same form yesterday .
he said , &quot; The government seems to be insistent on passing this from the Assembly within a week . &quot;
stating that there should be a consensus for passing the Wealth Fund law , Çakırözer said , &quot; Our biggest concern for this bill is irregularity . &quot;
he explained , &quot; Public assets , obligatory retirement deductions from laborers and workers and the incomes to be created from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed , and incomes to be obtained from privatization are handed over in an unlawful way to a structure which is outside of the Assembly and Court of Account &apos;s audit and does not have any responsibility . &quot;
stating that countries like Russia , China , and Gulf countries , where these kinds of funds are established , have petroleum income and a trade surplus , and the fund is financed in this way , Çakırözer said , &quot; However , we have a savings gap . &quot;
for this reason , the fund will consist of public sources , in other words , people &apos;s money .
it is planned that money will be transferred to the total of 100 billion to the unemployment fund , 100 billion from the individual retirement fund that was made obligatory for employees , and 50 billion from privatizations .
he said , &quot; In other words , this fund , to be all created by the money of the people , should certainly be under public auditing and this money should not be spent irresponsibly . &quot;
stressing that it is unacceptable that a fund , in which public sources are collected and public assets are supplied as collateral in incurring debt , is outside of the Assembly &apos;s audit , Çakırözer talked about his worries and concerns with regard to the Wealth Fund bill of law as follows :
works and procedures for the collecting and spending of such a big public asset and providing it as collateral cannot be glossed over with audits only from independent auditing firms .
there should certainly be public auditing and a transparent structure .
in the bill of law , there is no provision for the Wealth Fund &apos;s audit by the institutions and transparency .
a restriction was not placed on how many resources will be transferred .
no one will be able to call to account how the fund is used .
financing of big projects is shown as a reason for the aim of the fund .
therefore , there is no need to establish an unchecked fund outside of the budget .
why don &apos;t you include it in the budget ?
therefore the question , &quot; Why does it escape from an audit by the Court of Accounts and Assembly ? , &quot; naturally comes to mind .
stating that they are not against the transfer of the money collected in the Wealth Fund to investments , but they are against the fact that it is done with a nontransparent mechanism that does not give an account , Çakırözer continued as follows : &quot; it can be discussed whether there is a need for such a fund . &quot;
however , if the government is insistent on this , then we have to ensure that the international standards , which are valid in the countries where these kinds of investment funds are established , will be valid also in Turkey .
it should certainly be structured in a way that an auditing and responsibility mechanism is brought .
it should be established in a way that there won &apos;t be any blemish , and it will give an account to the citizens for their own money down to the last kurus .
underlining that they are certainly against the Wealth Fund bill of law in the form that it came to the committee , Çakırözer said , &quot; We are glad that AKP listens to our criticisms in the Assembly , especially after the July 15 coup attempt . &quot;
we hope that AKP will listen to our constructive criticisms also in this bill of law .
we are against unlawful use , transfer of the national assets , and irresponsibility of those who use them and the lack of public auditing .
he said , &quot; The desired Wealth Fund may be beneficial only if these concerns are eliminated . &quot;
it was reported that work has been done to ensure a consensus between AKP and the opposition on the coming bill of law .
&quot; the investments we made are a sign of the trust we place in Turkey &quot;
talking at a meeting in İstanbul , Chairman of the Executive Board in Ford Otomotiv , Ali Koç , said , &quot; the 30 billion TL investment we made in the last 5 years is a sign of the trust we put in the future of our country . &quot;
the Vice Chairman of the Executive Board in Koç Holding and the Chairman of the Executive Board in Ford Otomotiv , Ali Koç , and a large number of managers in foreign capital companies came together in the meeting under the theme &quot; Those who trust in Turkey , those who produce in Turkey , &quot; which was organized by the İstanbul Chamber Of Industry ( ISO ) .
speaking at the meeting , Ali Koç said , &quot; We , together with our partners , express our belief and trust in our country not only in an oral way but we also offer our support through our investments and actions . &quot;
the 30 billion TL investment we made in the last 5 years is a sign of the trust we put in the future of our country .
the indispensable aspects of Turkey to attract more foreign investment are a reliable and fair law system , a democracy of international standards , a skilled workforce and R &amp; D , innovation , entrepreneurship and an ecosystem which encourages added value .
our government offered the most comprehensive incentives of our Republic &apos;s history to our industrialists in recent years .
he added , &quot; I believe that we will be able to start the new &apos; Investment Action &apos; that we need with these incentives and integrated strategies . &quot;
chairman of the Board and CEO in Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey , Hüseyin Gelis , said , &quot; No issue is the problem of just one country anymore , we know this as global players . &quot;
we came to Turkey with a long term view .
our problems will be solved as long as we are in unity and solidarity .
we were able to bring something that could not happen in Turkey in the last 160 years .
we will continue to be present in these areas in Turkey .
he said , &quot; We will certainly establish factories but our horizon should be open in this area . &quot;
stating that Turkey is one of 10 countries as a priority for them , Shell Turkey President , Ahmet Erdem , said , &quot; Turkey is one of 10 countries that are a priority for Shell . &quot;
we believe in the potential and future of Turkey .
we made investments in many areas especially in energy , and we are continuing to do so .
we thank our President , Prime Minister and Ministers for their work that supports international investors .
reassuring work is done for international investors .
he said , &quot; This is in the direction of increasing the competitive power of our country . &quot;
Sandoz / Novartis Turkey and Middle East Region Director Dr. Altan Demirdere , &quot; Our Global CEO was about to come to Turkey on August 10 . &quot;
however , the trip was postponed .
we opposed this .
because the CEO &apos;s arrival was very important .
they made some requests such as a bulletproof car and guards .
then , when he came here , he saw that everything is normal .
he left the guards and car , and returned to his country happily .
investment in a country is like a marriage .
firstly , a promise is made , then the engagement is done if everything goes smoothly and you get married by making a long term plan .
we are married to Turkey and we do not have any intention to get divorced .
we returned from the brink of the abyss !
the Prime Minister , Binali Yıldırım , addressed the businessmen by participating by teleconference in the consultation meeting with the theme &quot; Those who trust in Turkey , those who produce in Turkey , &quot; which was organized in the Swiss Hotel by the İstanbul Chamber of Commerce .
stating that the industrial sector is the sector that will ensure Turkey &apos;s comparative advantage , Prime Minister Yıldırım said , &quot; In the industrial sector , we should avoid missing the process of transition into &apos; Industry 4.0 . &apos; &quot;
he said , &quot; If we give importance to becoming high in added value and a locomotive for our country and reach the 2023 targets , we need to think about the industrial revolution in the informatics and technology revolution , and achieve it . &quot;
adding that Turkey returned from the brink of an abyss on the night of July 15 , Prime Minister Yıldırım said , &quot; If those who intended to kill the future of our country , those who tried to demolish its democracy , the rascals who did not stop from bombing our Veteran Assembly , had been successful , we would be talking about a different Turkey today . &quot;
we would be talking about a Turkey , whose management was taken by the coup , whose national will was removed and which dropped from the world of developing countries league into the 3rd world countries .
he said , &quot; Thanks to God , we expelled this calamity with our nation &apos;s determination , our Chief Commander and esteemed President , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s sagacity , and our Government &apos;s determination . &quot;
Prime Minister Yıldırım continued as follows : &quot; we will immediately get over the impact of this incident and look ahead . &quot;
it is never , ever proper that we live with coups .
we have many assertive targets ahead .
this coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy .
those who expected chaos and crisis were mistaken again .
today both our democracy and economy are sound and on their feet .
our banking sector , finance sector are continuing to work in a healthy way .
it seems that the foreign trade deficit decreased by 25 percent in 2015 .
while the ratio of current deficit to national income was 5.8 percent in 2014 , this ratio fell to 4.5 in 2015 .
we are aiming to drop it to 4 by the end of the year .
we will never change our tight stance on public finance .
Turkey &apos;s 2016 budget is higher than the national income of 130 countries .
we decreased the ratio of the budget deficit to national income , which was over 11 percent , to the level of 1.3 percent in 2015 and we are struggling to maintain these ratios .
with regard to public debt , we are in a better situation than the EU and many countries in the world .
our banking and finance sectors are continuing their work on a stable base .
he added , &quot; Our Central Bank did not need to add foreign currency to the market in spite of July 15 and a decrease in our reserves is out of the question , we have a gross reserve of over 121 billion dollars . &quot;
explaining that they will provide all kinds of conveniences for the development of the economy , increasing production and creating new employment areas , Prime Minister Yıldırım said , &quot; In addition , we are issuing comprehensive regulations to get rid of your retrospective debts . &quot;
we realized many regulations from the remission of stock to the installment of cash surplus and unpaid tax debts by again introducing new conveniences , and we are continuing to realize .
he said , &quot; As long as you continue to produce for the country and trust in your country , your government will continue to remove the obstacles for you one by one . &quot;

for this reason , as a matter of fact , our President talks about this matter repeatedly .
Turkey needs to get rid of this distress with the unity and solidarity that politics has shown after the July 15 civil Turkish democracy revolution with its real sector , banking system , government , and politics .
we welcome the recent developments here .

he explained , &quot; We will never , ever blink ; we won &apos;t lose the birds in our hands while going after the bird on the branch . &quot;
Zeybekçi stated that a green passport will be given to exporters later on as well , and added , &quot; A law for one of the recent decisions was issued , and we finished its regulation in the ministry of economy ; we will put the privileged green passport which represents our country under the order of our exporters with around 17 or 20 thousand exporters among the exporters in the first round . &quot;
&quot; those WHO committed the coup attempt should BE cleared from the state &quot;
mentioning the July 15 coup attempt and the state of emergency declared afterwards , the Deputy Prime Minister , Mehmet Şimşek , described the coup attempt as a &apos; nightmare &apos; and said , &quot; However , it is now behind us , we should look ahead from now on . &quot;
stating that the state of emergency was declared because of two reasons , Şimşek said , &quot; surely those who were starting an insurrection and those who committed the coup attempt should be cleared from the state and this process is advancing ; however , the more important thing is that serious administrative reform is needed in order not to face these kinds of coup attempts . &quot;
therefore the State of Emergency was declared as an atmosphere needed for these administrative reforms and many serious structural reforms have been done up until now .
he said , &quot; surely we acted and we will act within the democratic principles and state of law while doing all this . &quot;
expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas , Şimşek stressed that there is no reason to worry for the companies and individuals that have not been involved in the financing of terrorism .
mentioning that Turkey &apos;s democracy got stronger , Şimşek said , &quot; In my opinion , the foundations of Turkey &apos;s democracy got stronger ; because when you look at the root of the problems in the recent past , you will certainly see that this gang of betrayers had a hand in the matter . &quot;
he said , &quot; Therefore , the clearing of this terrorist organization from the state , and the closing of this period in Turkey will strengthen Turkey &apos;s democracy . &quot;
explaining that economic foundations are strong and they returned to their structural reform agenda without losing any time , Şimşek said , &quot; Turkey returned to its main agenda , there are advances in the structural reforms . &quot;
as a matter of fact , structural reforms are our sine qua non because populism and protectionism are rising around the world .
he said , &quot; Turkey can be prepared for the future only by making reforms . &quot;
finally stressing that Turkey will not break loose from the West , Şimşek said , &quot; Turkey may have a clash of ideas with our western allies , friends from time to time but Turkey will not break loose from the West , it will not give up on the European Union . &quot;
he dove headfirst from 25 meters to the sea and ...
17 @-@ year @-@ old Şamil Tayyar Bayrakçı was hospitalized after he dove headfirst from the cliff called &quot; Eagle Hill &quot; from a height of 25 meters into the sea in Antalya .

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attraction of Heathrow , just as it was with London 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games .
the Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow .
for our local communities alone we &apos;ll create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great .
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage .
the doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it .
like the Olympics , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211bn in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK .
we have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £ 11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from T5 - voted the world &apos;s best airport terminal five years in a row , to T2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s busiest two runways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of .
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus , Facebook in &quot; cat @-@ and @-@ mouse game &quot; over ad blocking
for companies that make money from online advertising , attempts to circumvent ad @-@ blocking software amount to a &quot; cat @-@ and @-@ mouse game , &quot; according to one of the companies that makes that software .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site , Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again .
on Tuesday , Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads .
but Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes .
in a blog post , Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this sort of back @-@ and @-@ forth battle between the open source ad @-@ blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented , &quot; and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry .
globally , roughly 200 million people use ad blockers , according to a study last year from Pagefair and adobe ; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices , mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company is going after ad blockers on desktop however , because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook &apos;s mobile Apps for the social network and Instagram , a spokesperson said .
desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on Tuesday , Facebook said it would be updating its &quot; ad preferences &quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock &apos;s new filters were concerning because they would also block some non @-@ advertising content on the site .
&quot; this isn &apos;t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , &quot; a Facebook spokesperson said in an e @-@ mailed statement .
AD blockers are a blunt instrument , which is why we &apos;ve instead focused on building tools like Ad preferences to put control in people &apos;s hands .
woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday .
a woman lay down in the dark on the road &quot; in a desperate act &quot; and was hit by several vehicles , Vaud police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a Swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lorry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a &quot; logical &quot; step in a situation like this , lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that &apos;s what the prosecutor must determine , &quot; said Hofstetter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone with information about Thursday &apos;s incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at NASA &apos;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus &apos; past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not Venus , with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ chocked atmosphere , might have once hosted Earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that Venus &apos; slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin , Earth @-@ like atmosphere and still spun slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of early Venus .
the planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer .
&quot; in the GISS model &apos;s simulation , Venus &apos; slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time , &quot; GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release .
this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating .
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth &apos;s today .
the model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists .
though likely once habitable , Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
its Oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light .
as its hydrogen escaped , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus , the Venus we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Patrick Roy resigns as avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado avalanche on Thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
Colorado executive vice president / general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; for the past three years , I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado avalanche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy said in the statement .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and VP @-@ hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
Sakic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanked Roy for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick informed me of his decision today , &quot; Sakic said .
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league &apos;s best coach during his rookie season with the avalanche in 2013 @-@ 14 .
he guided the club to 112 points and a first @-@ place finish in the Central Division , but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
the avalanche posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in 2015 @-@ 16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild @-@ card spot in the Western Conference .
a Hall of Fame goaltender , Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the avalanche .
north Sea oil workers resume talks , suspend strike
labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negotiators said .
strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group and the unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute , &quot; a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full @-@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
Shell , for its part , has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega @-@ merger with British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation .
the North Sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; in the North Sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
the latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , &quot; Luisa Rebull , a research scientist at Caltech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena , said in a news release .
the Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light @-@ years from Earth .
many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood , having been born roughly 125 million years ago .
they &apos;re spinning as fast as they ever will .
at their peak spin rates , these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind .
as these winds travel across the stars &apos; magnetic fields , they enact a braking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures each star &apos;s spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots .
the latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
Rebull likens the stars to dancers , larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &apos; ballet &apos; of the Pleiades , we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars , &quot; said Rebull .
because the Pleiades cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates .
&quot; the Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Rebull .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their &apos; dance shoes , &apos; so to speak .
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal .

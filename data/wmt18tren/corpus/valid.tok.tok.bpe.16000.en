in 9@@ 11 C@@ all , Professor Ad@@ mits to S@@ ho@@ oting gir@@ l@@ friend
in a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly shak@@ y , colle@@ ge professor Shan@@ non lam@@ b told police he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lam@@ b made a point to say his " swe@@ et do@@ g " was there ali@@ ve and probably up@@ set , and said the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found A@@ my P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s ' body and a hand @ - @ written note s@@ cri@@ b@@ b@@ led on a wh@@ ite legal p@@ ad : " I am so very sor@@ ry I wish I could take it back I lov@@ ed A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever lov@@ ed me , " read the letter authorities say was signed by lam@@ b .
there was no indic@@ ation that lam@@ b , who was teac@@ hing two online cl@@ ass@@ es for Del@@ ta State University in C@@ lev@@ el@@ and , Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi , had already trav@@ ele@@ d 300 mil@@ es to the school 's camp@@ us , where police believe he shot and killed a well @ - @ lik@@ ed history professor , E@@ than Sch@@ mid@@ t , in the do@@ or@@ way to his office .
Del@@ ta State University police chief L@@ yn@@ n Bu@@ for@@ d said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a@@ .@@ m@@ .
he said lam@@ b made the fa@@ te@@ ful 9@@ 11 call some@@ time after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and fac@@ ulty to hi@@ de behind loc@@ ked doors , authorities were still trying to pi@@ ece together what motiv@@ ated lam@@ b .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who k@@ new him helped pain@@ t a picture of a tal@@ ented but pos@@ sibly troub@@ led teac@@ her .
students said they lo@@ oked forward to his class .
police in G@@ auti@@ er , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Sch@@ mid@@ t himself had included lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the " won@@ der@@ ful people " he shared his academ@@ ic life with .
both ta@@ ught in the Di@@ vision of Social Sciences and H@@ ist@@ ory , which lists 17 fac@@ ulty members , and many students took cour@@ ses from both .
at the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
a student who praised lam@@ b , Br@@ and@@ on Be@@ aver@@ s , said he also se@@ e@@ med ag@@ it@@ ated and j@@ it@@ tery , " like there was something wrong with him . "
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said lam@@ b told him he was dealing with st@@ ress at the end of the 2014 @ - @ 15 academ@@ ic year .
lam@@ b had earlier asked Del@@ ta State University for a medical leave of ab@@ s@@ ence , saying he had a health issue of some sor@@ t .
this year , he was only teac@@ hing two online cl@@ ass@@ es .
recent changes in the university 's h@@ iring policies meant that the doc@@ torate lam@@ b had worked so hard to ear@@ n would not guarantee him an auto@@ matic ten@@ ure track to become an ass@@ istant professor .
University President Wil@@ liam La@@ For@@ ge said he didn ' t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Sch@@ mid@@ t but " obvi@@ ously there was something in Mr@@ . lam@@ b 's mind . "
those are questions lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after fle@@ eing the camp@@ us , police later pic@@ ked up lam@@ b 's tra@@ il when he cros@@ sed back into Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be appre@@ hen@@ ded , lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 38 @ - @ cal@@ i@@ ber p@@ ist@@ ol in the back@@ yar@@ d of a home about a m@@ ile south of his parents ' home on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Gre@@ en@@ vil@@ le , Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi , said Washington Coun@@ ty Cor@@ on@@ er Me@@ the@@ l John@@ son .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to that home , though John@@ son said she believes he k@@ new the people who lived there .
lam@@ b grew up in the area .
lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and ta@@ ught geo@@ graphy and education cl@@ ass@@ es .
he received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of lam@@ b 's l@@ ong@@ time friends described him as s@@ mar@@ t , char@@ is@@ matic and fun@@ ny .
Carla H@@ air@@ st@@ on said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the co@@ ol ol@@ der gu@@ y who tried for several years to te@@ ach her to play gu@@ it@@ ar .
he was quite the he@@ art@@ thro@@ b back then .
all the gir@@ ls would me@@ l@@ t when he was around , " said H@@ air@@ st@@ on , now 40 and living in the J@@ ack@@ son su@@ bur@@ b of Br@@ and@@ on .
lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had appar@@ ently been dating for some time .
in the 9@@ 11 call , lam@@ b said " I killed my wife , " but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
they had a do@@ g named L@@ igh@@ t@@ ning that lived with them at the bri@@ ck house that backs up to a bay@@ ou in G@@ auti@@ er .
police said the do@@ g was O@@ K .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s ' e@@ x @ - @ hus@@ band , S@@ ha@@ wn O ' Ste@@ en , said they di@@ v@@ or@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a da@@ ughter who 's now 19 .
" she was completely dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted , " O ' Ste@@ en said of his da@@ ughter .
she and her mother were absol@@ u@@ tely best friends .
O ' Ste@@ en said he had not met lam@@ b but heard through his da@@ ughter A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il that lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blu@@ es .
lam@@ b met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s when he and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occas@@ i@@ onal gi@@ g .
O ' Ste@@ en said his da@@ ughter wri@@ tes and s@@ ings her own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mik@@ e S@@ ha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment co@@ ordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Ro@@ om , a di@@ mly lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said he last saw lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s the night of Sep@@ t . 5 , after lam@@ b had finished playing his gu@@ it@@ ar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
there was no sign of anything am@@ is@@ s .
" just a happy couple , " he said .
we were c@@ utting up and thro@@ wing one @ - @ lin@@ ers at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of w@@ it about them .
Sch@@ mid@@ t , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first @ - @ year semin@@ ar program and speci@@ al@@ ized in N@@ ative American and col@@ on@@ ial history , said D@@ on Al@@ lan Mit@@ ch@@ el@@ l , an English professor at the school .
he was mar@@ ried and had three young children .
he stu@@ died at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in Kan@@ sas and was president of his f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity and student government .
on the Del@@ ta State camp@@ us in C@@ lev@@ el@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including fac@@ ulty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a c@@ and@@ le@@ light mem@@ orial .
Sch@@ mid@@ t 's wife , L@@ iz , and bro@@ ther J@@ ef@@ f Sch@@ mid@@ t also attended the vi@@ gi@@ l , during which the university cho@@ ir san@@ g " b@@ right Mor@@ ning St@@ ar " and " amaz@@ ing gr@@ ace . "
cl@@ ass@@ es resume Wednesday .
" we 're trying to get our students to come back , " La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of he@@ aling .

this story has been correc@@ ted to reflect that police are now saying lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Sch@@ mid@@ t , and that while lam@@ b refer@@ red to P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indic@@ ation the two ever mar@@ ried .

UN Chief S@@ ays Th@@ ere I@@ s N@@ o Military Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary @ - @ General Ban Ki @ - @ moon says his response to Russia 's stepped up military support for Syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five @ - @ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the U@@ . N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U@@ . N@@ . Security Council , to un@@ ite and support inclu@@ sive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U@@ . S@@ . , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the side@@ lines of the General Assembly 's minist@@ erial session later this month to discuss Syria .
he expressed regre@@ t that di@@ visions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers " made this situation un@@ sol@@ v@@ able . "
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l N@@ um@@ bers Th@@ at S@@ how Donald Tr@@ um@@ p I@@ s F@@ or Re@@ al
some have tried to la@@ bel him a f@@ li@@ p @ - @ F@@ l@@ op@@ per .
others have dismissed him as a j@@ oke .
and some are holding out for an im@@ pl@@ os@@ ion .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to drag Donald Tr@@ um@@ p down from at@@ op the polls , it has@@ n ' t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Tr@@ um@@ p 's lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l 's nomin@@ ation chances .
of course , it 's still early in the election cy@@ cle .
none of this is to say that Tr@@ um@@ p is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nomin@@ ation .
pun@@ di@@ ts point out that at this time in 2011 , Ric@@ k Per@@ ry 's lead was giving way to a rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush 's Su@@ per PA@@ C and the economic conservative group Club for Gro@@ w@@ th are reco@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ing Tr@@ um@@ p 's st@@ ay@@ ing power and beginning to un@@ lo@@ ad their dol@@ lar@@ s to top@@ ple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is@@ n ' t just a passing phase :
tr@@ um@@ p 's fav@@ or@@ ability ratings have turned 180 de@@ gre@@ es .
right before Donald Tr@@ um@@ p announced his candidacy in mid @ - @ June , a Mon@@ m@@ outh University poll showed only two in 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @ - @ July , it was 40 per@@ cent .
in early August , it was 52 per@@ cent .
now , six in 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a fav@@ or@@ able view of Donald Tr@@ um@@ p .
roug@@ h@@ ly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac poll in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 per@@ cent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans there had a fav@@ or@@ able view of Tr@@ um@@ p .
two @ - @ thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ um@@ p as the nomin@@ e@@ e .
in a CNN / O@@ R@@ C poll last week , 67 per@@ cent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either " en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tic " or " satisfied " if Tr@@ um@@ p were the nomin@@ e@@ e .
only two in 10 say they would be " up@@ set " if he were the nomin@@ e@@ e .
only B@@ en Car@@ son gener@@ ates roug@@ h@@ ly the same level of en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m as Tr@@ um@@ p ( 43 per@@ cent say they would be " en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tic " v@@ s@@ . 40 per@@ cent who say the same of Tr@@ um@@ p ) .
the next clos@@ est in en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m ?
Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o with only 21 per@@ cent .
on the f@@ li@@ p side , 47 per@@ cent of Repub@@ lican voters say they would be " dis@@ satisfied " or " up@@ set " if establishment fav@@ or@@ ite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nomin@@ e@@ e .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans don ' t see Tr@@ um@@ p 's temper@@ am@@ ent as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ um@@ p has been widely cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed for his bomb@@ ast and ins@@ ults , 52 per@@ cent of le@@ an@@ ed Repub@@ lican voters nation@@ wide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ am@@ ent to be president , according to Monday 's AB@@ C News / Washington Post poll .
the same number holds in the first @ - @ in @ - @ the @ - @ nation ca@@ uc@@ us state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 per@@ cent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the person@@ ality to be commander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
still , 44 per@@ cent think he doesn ' t have the person@@ ality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 indepen@@ dents say his temper@@ am@@ ent does not bel@@ ong in the White House , according to AB@@ C / Post .
Repub@@ lican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pun@@ dit hat@@ s , Repub@@ lican voters think Tr@@ um@@ p is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nomin@@ ation , four in 10 said Tr@@ um@@ p was the best bet , according to a CNN / O@@ R@@ C poll out last week .
that 's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
full dis@@ closure : G@@ O@@ P voters ha@@ ven ' t had the clear@@ est cr@@ y@@ st@@ al ball in the past .
at this time last cy@@ cle , four in 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans pic@@ ked Ric@@ k Per@@ ry to win the nomin@@ ation , v@@ s@@ . only 28 per@@ cent for eventual nomin@@ e@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
still , it shows that a pl@@ ur@@ ality of G@@ O@@ P voters see Tr@@ um@@ p 's campaign as pla@@ u@@ sible .
even if Repub@@ lic@@ ans ral@@ lied around another candidate , Tr@@ um@@ p still be@@ ats almost everyone .
some pun@@ di@@ ts point out that the sp@@ l@@ inter@@ ed field is likely contribut@@ ing to Tr@@ um@@ p 's lead , while anti @ - @ Tr@@ um@@ p support is be spread di@@ ff@@ us@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a Mon@@ m@@ outh University poll in early September shows that , in a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical head @ - @ to @ - @ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Tr@@ um@@ p and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ um@@ p almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
he leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o by 14 points , W@@ alk@@ er by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ AN@@ D Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Ch@@ ris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
he 's in a dead he@@ at with T@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
B@@ en Car@@ son would lead the business@@ man by a wide 19 points in a hy@@ po@@ the@@ tical head @ - @ to @ - @ head .
a b@@ are majority of Donald Tr@@ um@@ p 's supporters say they 've made up their min@@ ds .
a new C@@ B@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Tr@@ um@@ p say they have loc@@ ked in their votes .
obvi@@ ously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 per@@ cent said they are leaving the door open to s@@ wit@@ ching candidates .
still , Tr@@ um@@ p 's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ si@@ der ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ on B@@ en Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their min@@ ds are twice as likely to go for Tr@@ um@@ p .
six in 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ um@@ p on immig@@ ration .
even since Donald Tr@@ um@@ p called immigrants from M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o " rap@@ ists " in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immig@@ ration has been front and cen@@ ter in the 20@@ 16 con@@ vers@@ ation .
some are wor@@ ried that Tr@@ um@@ p 's bomb@@ ast will drive crucial H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic voters away from the Repub@@ lican Party and damage re@@ bran@@ ding efforts .
but according to Monday 's new AB@@ C / Post poll , six in 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ um@@ p on immig@@ ration issues .
so as long as immig@@ ration remains in the sp@@ ot@@ light , it seems Donald Tr@@ um@@ p will remain too .
fru@@ stration with government is cli@@ m@@ bing to new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ um@@ p and B@@ en Car@@ son now account for roug@@ h@@ ly half of the support from Repub@@ lican voters , largely due to their out@@ si@@ der status .
six in 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Monday 's new AB@@ C / Post poll say they want a political out@@ si@@ der over someone with government experience .
and they are an@@ gr@@ y at Washington , too .
a D@@ es Mo@@ ines Re@@ g@@ ister / Bloomberg poll in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ stra@@ ted with Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per@@ cent " un@@ satisfied " and 21 per@@ cent " ma@@ d as hel@@ l . "
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n to make de@@ but at Prime Minister 's Qu@@ es@@ tions
since his election , M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's de@@ but at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly aw@@ ai@@ ted
new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n is to make his de@@ but at Prime Minister 's Qu@@ es@@ tions later , taking on David Cam@@ er@@ on for the first time .
M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six al@@ l@@ ot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely s@@ cru@@ tin@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
he has called for " less theatre and more facts " at the weekly sho@@ w@@ pi@@ ece .
he has also said he could sk@@ ip some ses@@ sions , leaving them to colleagues .
the en@@ counter will be the first parliamentary test of M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's leadership , coming after his appointment of a sha@@ dow cabinet and his speech to the T@@ U@@ C annual con@@ gress on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader 's decision to stand in sil@@ ence during the sing@@ ing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ att@@ le of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several front page st@@ ories in the newspapers .
M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokesman for M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n said he had " stood in respec@@ t@@ ful sil@@ ence " and did recognise the " her@@ o@@ ism of the R@@ oy@@ al Air Force in the B@@ att@@ le of Britain . "
but a member of M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's sha@@ dow cabinet , O@@ w@@ en S@@ mit@@ h , told BBC T@@ w@@ o 's News@@ night programme he would have advis@@ ed the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them " ir@@ respective " of his beli@@ ef that the mon@@ arch@@ y should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen sha@@ dow ministers have refused to serve in M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspondent R@@ ob@@ in Bran@@ t says policy differences are also " stac@@ king up " within Labour following M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government 's ca@@ p on benefits .
M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n told the T@@ U@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a ca@@ p al@@ together .
hours later M@@ r S@@ mit@@ h , the sha@@ dow work and pensions secretary , said the party was " very clear " that it was only op@@ posing government plans to reduce the level of ca@@ p from £ 2@@ 6,000 to £ 2@@ 3,000 .
M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cam@@ er@@ on has faced across the desp@@ at@@ ch bo@@ x over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has " crowd sour@@ ced " ideas for questions to ask M@@ r Cam@@ er@@ on and has been given more than 30,000 sugges@@ tions .
the Is@@ l@@ ington North MP has said P@@ M@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will ref@@ rain from both " re@@ par@@ tee " and tra@@ ding bar@@ bs , instead vo@@ wing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , in@@ equality and the challenges facing young people .
M@@ r Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n has said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the sha@@ dow business secretary , will de@@ pu@@ ti@@ se for him at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when M@@ r Cam@@ er@@ on is travel@@ ling abroad .
he has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the flo@@ or on occas@@ ion , saying he had appro@@ ac@@ hed the Com@@ m@@ ons Speaker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , M@@ r Cam@@ er@@ on said he wanted to move away from the " pun@@ ch and Ju@@ dy " st@@ yle of politics often associ@@ ated with P@@ M@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first tele@@ vised in 1990 , P@@ M@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ ome@@ ter of a leader 's ju@@ d@@ gement , their command of the Com@@ m@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and is in need of far @ - @ reaching reforms .

Met@@ cash laun@@ ches gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots campaign to fight Al@@ di inc@@ ur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its I@@ G@@ A sto@@ res from an Al@@ di on@@ sla@@ ught in South Australia and Western Australia .
gro@@ cer@@ y wh@@ o@@ le@@ sal@@ er Met@@ cash has kicked off a gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots campaign to defend the market share of I@@ G@@ A reta@@ il@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di inv@@ asion .
as Al@@ di prepar@@ es to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 sto@@ res in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ G@@ A super@@ markets are strengthening relation@@ ships with local food supp@@ li@@ ers and building the I@@ G@@ A br@@ and through main@@ stre@@ am and social media market@@ ing and events such as the A@@ de@@ la@@ ide show .
I@@ G@@ A reta@@ il@@ ers and supp@@ li@@ ers are jum@@ ping on board , with br@@ ands such as D@@ un@@ s@@ bor@@ ough @ - @ based ice cre@@ am maker Sim@@ mo 's offering tas@@ te test@@ ing at I@@ G@@ A sto@@ res and st@@ ore owners selling dis@@ coun@@ ted South Austral@@ ian football le@@ ague tic@@ kets to lo@@ yal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reve@@ al more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liqu@@ or and har@@ d@@ w@@ are wh@@ o@@ le@@ sal@@ er hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash 's I@@ G@@ A st@@ ore foot@@ print and gener@@ ate higher profit mar@@ gin@@ s than Met@@ cash 's I@@ G@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Austral@@ ian and Western Austral@@ ian shop@@ p@@ ers are not@@ ori@@ ously par@@ o@@ chi@@ al and I@@ G@@ A reta@@ il@@ ers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Vic@@ tor@@ ia and Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in w@@ a compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as M@@ organ Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the gro@@ cer@@ y market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first sto@@ res , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent reta@@ il@@ ers .
in a report this week , M@@ organ Stan@@ ley analyst T@@ om Ki@@ er@@ ath estimated that I@@ G@@ A reta@@ il@@ ers could lose $ 3@@ 60 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 20@@ 16 .
this forec@@ ast is based on the ass@@ um@@ ption that Al@@ di opens 25 sto@@ res in SA and 30 in w@@ a next year , gener@@ ating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales and vol@@ u@@ mes on Met@@ cash 's high fixed @ - @ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in ear@@ nings before interest and tax , M@@ r Ki@@ er@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Co@@ les , even though a recent Ro@@ y M@@ organ survey found I@@ G@@ A shop@@ p@@ ers were most lo@@ yal .
M@@ organ Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ cash 's food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 20@@ 16 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 17 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish D@@ ou@@ g@@ las@@ s , the founder of Mag@@ el@@ lan Financial Group , told a business l@@ un@@ ch in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne that Met@@ cash could " highly , probably dis@@ appear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to M@@ r D@@ ou@@ g@@ las@@ s ' comments .
but it is under@@ stood that a Met@@ cash board member cont@@ acted M@@ r D@@ ou@@ g@@ las@@ s last week .
I@@ G@@ A 's market share has fal@@ len from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and ear@@ nings from Met@@ cash 's food and gro@@ cer@@ y business , which supplies about 1@@ 200 I@@ G@@ A reta@@ il@@ ers , have fal@@ len 43 per cent since 2012 , reflec@@ ting operating de@@ le@@ ver@@ age as sales and mar@@ gin@@ s come under pressure .
however , the wh@@ o@@ le@@ sal@@ er is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year mat@@ ching shel@@ f prices at Co@@ les and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping I@@ G@@ A reta@@ il@@ ers ref@@ ur@@ b@@ ish sto@@ res by adding fas@@ ter @ - @ growing fresh food , and rol@@ ling out a better range of private la@@ bel gro@@ cer@@ ies .
Met@@ cash chief executive I@@ an Mor@@ ri@@ ce says the price mat@@ ching and st@@ ore ref@@ ur@@ bis@@ hment progra@@ ms are gaining tr@@ action and is hoping the wh@@ o@@ le@@ sal@@ er will return to under@@ lying profit growth in 20@@ 17 , for the first time in four years .
T@@ han@@ asi K@@ ok@@ kin@@ akis backed by T@@ en@@ nis Australia president Ste@@ ve He@@ al@@ y
T@@ han@@ asi K@@ ok@@ kin@@ akis de@@ serves ku@@ do@@ s rather than criticism for his behavi@@ our .
T@@ han@@ asi K@@ ok@@ kin@@ akis has been the col@@ la@@ ter@@ al damage in the recent stor@@ m around his friend Nic@@ k Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os and de@@ serves ku@@ do@@ s rather than criticism for his own behavi@@ our , according to T@@ en@@ nis Australia president Ste@@ ve He@@ al@@ y .
K@@ ok@@ kin@@ akis , the youn@@ ger of the tal@@ ented du@@ o regular@@ ly refer@@ red to as the " Special K@@ S , " was dra@@ g@@ ged into an un@@ welcome sp@@ ot@@ light by the inf@@ am@@ ous Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os s@@ le@@ dge of St@@ an W@@ a@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Mon@@ tre@@ al Mas@@ ters .
in a fi@@ ery qual@@ if@@ ying match in C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ ati soon after , K@@ ok@@ kin@@ akis and his oppon@@ ent R@@ yan Har@@ ris@@ on twice had to be separ@@ ated by the cha@@ ir ump@@ ire , with Har@@ ris@@ on declar@@ ing : " W@@ a@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should 've dec@@ ked Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os , and I should dec@@ k that k@@ id . "
while he was last seen s@@ mas@@ hing a rac@@ qu@@ et after c@@ ram@@ p fo@@ iled a potential US Open up@@ set of Richard G@@ as@@ qu@@ et , K@@ ok@@ kin@@ akis has been def@@ ended sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ al@@ y .
the te@@ en@@ ager is currently in G@@ las@@ go@@ w , competing with S@@ am Gro@@ th for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Ber@@ n@@ ard Tom@@ ic in the Dav@@ is Cup se@@ mi @ - @ final against Britain .
" one thing I do feel quite ke@@ en@@ ly about is I think T@@ han@@ asi 's been dra@@ g@@ ged into the fra@@ y a little bit , " He@@ al@@ y said .
he did break a rac@@ qu@@ et when he lost when he cra@@ mp@@ ed in the US , but he 's not the first player to break a rac@@ qu@@ et out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know T@@ han@@ asi well enough to know he wo@@ uldn ' t be pro@@ ud of that .
but , really , he 's hand@@ led himself extremely well , in pre@@ t@@ ty pro@@ vo@@ c@@ ative circumstances in the US with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he de@@ serves a lot of credit .
he 's a great team around him , he 's got a great family around him and I just think he 's been a little hard done by .
he 's a very ma@@ ture 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old , he works very hard , and he f@@ its in with the team and so on , he has@@ n ' t ever had an issue with the other players , he 's well respected in the loc@@ ker room , he tra@@ ins hard , he 's in great shap@@ e , he 's a very stable and ma@@ ture young gu@@ y and I just think he de@@ serves to be ju@@ dged on his own mer@@ its .
He@@ al@@ y also backed the decision to over@@ look Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os for the important ti@@ e , starting on Friday , describing the " mutual decision " as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long @ - @ term fi@@ x@@ ture in the team .
" first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the ti@@ e and not all the controversy around [ Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os ] , " He@@ al@@ y said .
and I think Nic@@ k , he 's ris@@ en very quickly , as people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ra@@ y have pointed out , he 's growing up in the public eye and he 's made some ter@@ ri@@ ble er@@ r@@ ors and de@@ serves all the criticism he gets , but we 're trying to support him , we 're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the li@@ me@@ light where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it 's best for the team and it 's best for him .
Europe mig@@ rant crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , se@@ als border , de@@ tains mig@@ rants
declar@@ ing a state of emergency , Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , a@@ iming to shut down the f@@ low of mig@@ rants po@@ uring in .
cha@@ os en@@ su@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of mig@@ rants p@@ iled up in a no man 's land , and Serbian officials reac@@ ted with ou@@ tra@@ ge .
st@@ uc@@ k for an un@@ known amount of time on a stri@@ p of road between the two countries ' chec@@ k@@ points , those fle@@ eing violence in their home@@ lands p@@ it@@ ched ten@@ ts and sett@@ led in .
but fru@@ str@@ ations were on the rise .
as a police helicop@@ ter h@@ over@@ ed above , mig@@ rants chan@@ ted " Open the border ! " and sh@@ ou@@ ted ins@@ ults at Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister declared it was " unacceptable " that mig@@ rants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arri@@ ving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not col@@ la@@ ter@@ al damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , " Ivica Dacic said in Pra@@ gue .
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @ - @ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @ - @ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immig@@ ration policy at a conten@@ ti@@ ous meeting in Brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people seeking ref@@ uge in over@@ wh@@ el@@ med Italy and Greece and spoke hop@@ efully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 1@@ 20,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the contin@@ ent 's immig@@ ration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not p@@ in@@ ning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neigh@@ b@@ ors .
Tuesday 's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a ra@@ zor @ - @ w@@ ire f@@ ence along part of its border with Romania to stop the f@@ low of mig@@ rants through the country , now that it has finished a f@@ ence on the Serbian border .
C@@ B@@ S News correspondent Char@@ li@@ e D ' Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ ma@@ tes were en@@ listed in the race to finish the ra@@ zor w@@ ire f@@ ence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last few months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ k and entry point into the European Union for mig@@ rants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister V@@ ik@@ tor Or@@ ban , however , has insisted that most arri@@ ving are economic mig@@ rants seeking a better life , not war refugees enti@@ tled to protection - a view sharply at od@@ ds with other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws that took effect at mid@@ night in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4 @ - @ me@@ ter ( 13 @ - @ fo@@ ot ) ra@@ zor @ - @ w@@ ire f@@ ence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffic@@ kers .
" due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es a state of crisis , " government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kovac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of S@@ z@@ e@@ ged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
techn@@ ically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but As@@ soci@@ ated Press reporters at the border have seen heav@@ ily armed military personnel with vehicles and do@@ gs for days .
G@@ y@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , home@@ land security adviser to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deep@@ er in the country .
they got across by dama@@ ging the f@@ ence , are now in police custody and are being charged with commit@@ ting offen@@ ses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly rep@@ air@@ ing the f@@ ence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deplo@@ ying a train car covered with ra@@ zor w@@ ire to close one of them .
cha@@ os en@@ v@@ elop@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hungar@@ ians opened a tin@@ y office in a metal con@@ tain@@ er to process people and crow@@ ds pres@@ sed to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of mig@@ rants blocked the main highway connec@@ ting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were ref@@ using food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
election 20@@ 16 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Ber@@ ni@@ e Sand@@ ers cut by half in national poll
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @ - @ dig@@ it lead in the Democratic race for the nomin@@ ation nation@@ ally , but Sen@@ . Ber@@ ni@@ e Sand@@ ers is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 per@@ cent ) , while Sand@@ ers comes in second , with 27 per@@ cent ( up from 17 per@@ cent ) .
Vice President Jo@@ e Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , recei@@ ves support from 15 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary con@@ tests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their min@@ ds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but Clinton 's back@@ ers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month 's C@@ B@@ S News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while Sand@@ ers has made some gain@@ s .
Clinton main@@ tains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have nar@@ ro@@ wed .
her support among men has dropped consider@@ ably and Sand@@ ers only tra@@ ils her by 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated , and she and Sand@@ ers are now even .
however , Clinton still has a large lead with ol@@ der voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of Sand@@ ers by double @ - @ dig@@ its among liber@@ als , but Sand@@ ers now has a 5 @ - @ point ed@@ ge with this group .
about half of Democratic primary voters nation@@ wide say they would en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tically support Clinton if she became the party 's nomin@@ e@@ e .
a quarter would support her with some reser@@ v@@ ations and another 15 per@@ cent would only back her because she is the nomin@@ e@@ e .
six per@@ cent would not support her .
perhaps not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , Clinton 's current supporters are especially likely to be en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tically support her .
while 48 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters say they would en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ tically back Clinton , fe@@ wer Repub@@ lican voters say that about their f@@ ron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald Tr@@ um@@ p ( 35 per@@ cent ) .
when Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open @ - @ ended question why they want her to be the nomin@@ e@@ e , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 per@@ cent ) , followed by it 's time for a woman president ( 13 per@@ cent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per@@ cent ) .
also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with B@@ ill Clinton ( 9 per@@ cent ) .
agreement on the issues , and elec@@ t@@ ability are also cited .
as the vice president weigh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jum@@ p in the race - although a third don ' t think he should .
when Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party 's nomin@@ ation , Biden is the top pic@@ k .
among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sand@@ ers .
if Biden cho@@ os@@ es not to run for the Democratic nomin@@ ation , Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sand@@ ers wi@@ den@@ s , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fif@@ ty @ - @ five per@@ cent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 per@@ cent last month .
Biden is a dist@@ ant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has ris@@ en .
still , when asked which is more important in a nomin@@ e@@ e , Democratic voters pic@@ k issues over elec@@ t@@ ability .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nomin@@ e@@ e to these primary voters .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key character@@ isti@@ cs among their party 's primary voters .
maj@@ orities see Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Biden as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y and as having strong leadership qu@@ alities .
Biden does the best of the three on hon@@ es@@ ty , while Clinton 's streng@@ th is leadership .
thir@@ ty per@@ cent of Democratic primary voters don ' t think Clinton is hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y , twice as many as say that about Sand@@ ers ( 15 per@@ cent ) , but 27 per@@ cent don ' t have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sand@@ ers and Biden as in line with their views ide@@ olog@@ ically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sand@@ ers .
as questions continue about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal e@@ mail address and ser@@ ver while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her ex@@ plan@@ ation of the matter and say it has@@ n ' t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
but it 's a different story among the American public overall .
half of Americ@@ ans are now dis@@ satisfied with her ex@@ plan@@ ation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public 's views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americ@@ ans say the e@@ mail controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 per@@ cent say their opinion of her has gro@@ wn worse .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
even though Clinton is viewed as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y by her party 's voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 per@@ cent see her as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
six@@ ty @ - @ two per@@ cent of registered voters don ' t think of her as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y .
at the same time , 55 per@@ cent of registered voters nation@@ wide don ' t see Tr@@ um@@ p as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y either .
both Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ p , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tes@@ ted , Biden , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on hon@@ es@@ ty .
more see Sand@@ ers as hon@@ est than not , but like Car@@ son , many don ' t have an opinion of him .
the mar@@ gin of er@@ ror for the sa@@ mp@@ le of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
B@@ en Car@@ son dra@@ ws close behind Donald Tr@@ um@@ p in national poll
B@@ en Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Tr@@ um@@ p in the new@@ est C@@ B@@ S News / New York Times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ roun@@ ging for a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old
Repub@@ lican voters nation@@ wide continue to back Tr@@ um@@ p in large numbers , cli@@ m@@ bing from 23 % support in the last C@@ B@@ S poll , conducted before the Fo@@ x News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
but Car@@ son ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demo@@ graphic groups , ed@@ ging out Tr@@ um@@ p among colle@@ ge @ - @ edu@@ cated Repub@@ lican voters .
the rest of the field , with the excep@@ tion of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o G@@ ov@@ . John Kas@@ ich , has sli@@ pped behind with Wis@@ cons@@ in G@@ ov@@ . Scot@@ t W@@ alk@@ er fal@@ ling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former F@@ l@@ ori@@ da G@@ ov@@ . Je@@ b Bush , former Ar@@ kan@@ sas G@@ ov@@ . Mik@@ e H@@ uc@@ kab@@ e@@ e and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da Sen@@ . Mar@@ co Ru@@ bi@@ o all ti@@ ed for third place with 6 % .
the mar@@ gin of er@@ ror for the 3@@ 76 @ - @ person sa@@ mp@@ le of Repub@@ lican voters in this new@@ est poll is plus @ - @ or @ - @ min@@ us 6 % , and was conducted Sep@@ t .
the latest CNN / O@@ R@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- lan@@ ding at 19 % support among Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ um@@ p 's 32 % support .
the latest poll from AB@@ C News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ um@@ p significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
facing a rising Car@@ son last week , Tr@@ um@@ p took some pot@@ sh@@ ots at the retired ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ur@@ ge@@ on , even as Car@@ son ap@@ olo@@ giz@@ ed for questi@@ oning Tr@@ um@@ p 's fa@@ ith .
" we need energy , " Tr@@ um@@ p said last Saturday during a campaign stop in I@@ ow@@ a .
five f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity members charged in death of Bar@@ u@@ ch Col@@ le@@ ge fres@@ h@@ man
nearly two years after a colle@@ ge student died during a f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity haz@@ ing r@@ itu@@ al in Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia 's Po@@ con@@ o Moun@@ tains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of New York City 's Bar@@ u@@ ch Col@@ le@@ ge P@@ i Del@@ ta P@@ S@@ I f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity bru@@ t@@ ally assa@@ ul@@ ted ch@@ un " Michael " Den@@ g during an initi@@ ation r@@ ite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contribut@@ ing to his death , police said .
officials said he was b@@ lin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , sad@@ d@@ led with a 30 @ - @ p@@ ound back@@ p@@ ack full of s@@ and , and repeatedly tack@@ led while he tried to wal@@ k to@@ ward a target across a fro@@ zen field .
Mr@@ . Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined that his head hur@@ t then fell un@@ con@@ sci@@ ous .
P@@ i Del@@ ta P@@ S@@ I f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Den@@ g passed out , and allegedly w@@ ai@@ ted an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change Den@@ g 's c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , Google his sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity 's national president to seek ad@@ vice , Police Chief Ch@@ ris W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference .
" at this point , members began to hi@@ de par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ al@@ ia and bas@@ ically put the f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity 's well @ - @ being over that of Michael Den@@ g 's , " Chief W@@ ag@@ ner said .
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning .
according to an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was sub@@ j@@ ected to repe@@ ated b@@ l@@ un@@ t force tra@@ uma to his head , tor@@ so , and th@@ igh@@ s .
" too many families have been dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted as a result of f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity haz@@ ing , with at least one student d@@ ying every year from haz@@ ing since 19@@ 70 , " D@@ ou@@ g@@ las Fi@@ er@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ney representing Den@@ g 's family , said in a statement .
Fr@@ ater@@ n@@ ities and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a Mon@@ ro@@ e Coun@@ ty gr@@ and jur@@ y recommended third @ - @ degree murder charges for the first five members .
thir@@ ty @ - @ two other f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity members , including Mr@@ . Men@@ g , will also be charged with assa@@ ult haz@@ ing and criminal con@@ spir@@ acy .
" we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there 's an organiz@@ ation that sanc@@ tioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we 're going to hold them accoun@@ table as well , " W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ u@@ ch Col@@ le@@ ge banned the f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity and the national f@@ r@@ ater@@ n@@ ity rev@@ oked its af@@ fil@@ i@@ ation with the local chapter .
here 's what will happen when the F@@ ed ra@@ ises interest rates
a rate hi@@ ke will come and the bul@@ l market will st@@ um@@ ble , bon@@ d yi@@ elds will cli@@ m@@ b and the economy will sli@@ p into a recession .
this we know .
what we don ' t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specif@@ ically , history offers little gu@@ ide about ti@@ ming .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hi@@ ke and as long as 86 months .
the F@@ ederal Res@@ er@@ ve 's ag@@ gres@@ si@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that 's why officials at the U@@ . S@@ . central bank have stressed so v@@ ig@@ or@@ ously that investors should not be focused on when it star@@ ts raising rates but rather the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory of how long it will take to normal@@ ize .
there are , indeed , multi@@ ple vari@@ ab@@ les at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate @ - @ hi@@ ke f@@ us@@ s may have been over@@ done .
" the first hi@@ ke from the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably be interpre@@ ted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of ' che@@ ap money , ' " Ju@@ li@@ an J@@ es@@ so@@ p , chief global economist at Cap@@ ital Econom@@ ics , said in a note to cli@@ ents .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U@@ . S@@ . interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the se@@ is@@ m@@ ic sho@@ ck that many seem to fear .
that 's not to say there won ' t be effects , however .
here 's a look at how some areas of the economy could re@@ act , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip@@ ation of rate hi@@ kes can make things v@@ ola@@ tile for a while .
once the hi@@ ke h@@ its , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
" it does seem there is a trend for equ@@ ity returns to st@@ all 12 @ - @ 24 months after the first hi@@ ke , which again perhaps reflects the la@@ g in monetary policy , " Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happen@@ s after the F@@ ed hi@@ kes .
more specif@@ ically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 per@@ cent - head@@ ing into the rate hi@@ ke , fair@@ ly fla@@ t in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.@@ 6 per@@ cent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cy@@ c@@ les of 14@@ .@@ 4 per@@ cent , according to a recent analysis Bo@@ b dol@@ l , chief equ@@ ity strate@@ g@@ ist at N@@ u@@ ve@@ en As@@ set Man@@ agement , pos@@ ted on Bar@@ ron 's .
Deutsche said the impact on sto@@ cks ten@@ ds to get more pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ced later in the rate @ - @ hi@@ king cy@@ cle and returns begin to di@@ min@@ ish .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but rate hi@@ kes often help them along .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could has@@ ten a recession .
most not@@ ably , gr@@ os@@ s domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a F@@ ed rate hi@@ ke .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hi@@ kes since 19@@ 50 , only twice has nomin@@ al year over year GDP been below 4.5 per@@ cent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 per@@ cent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter trac@@ king at just 1.5 per@@ cent , according to the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed .
hi@@ king rates into such a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be risk@@ y and set up the question of " whether this time is different , " Deutsche said .
market participants have been br@@ ac@@ ing for a F@@ ed hi@@ ke all year , with all ey@@ es turned to@@ ward this week 's F@@ ederal Open Mar@@ ket Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
while many strate@@ g@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe the FO@@ M@@ C could approve a hi@@ ke at this meeting , fut@@ ures tra@@ ding indi@@ cates just a 25 per@@ cent pro@@ b@@ ability .
" in our study since 19@@ 50 , all hi@@ king cy@@ c@@ les to date have been in a sup@@ er cy@@ cle of increasing le@@ ver@@ age with GDP ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing pr@@ er@@ ec@@ ession pe@@ aks very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , " the report said .
by contrast this has been a uni@@ qu@@ ely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sa@@ mp@@ le period .
the current cy@@ cle is by far the l@@ ongest the F@@ ed has w@@ ai@@ ted since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and coun@@ ting .
fixed income also has been v@@ ola@@ tile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hi@@ ke , and the pat@@ tern is some@@ what similar to what equ@@ ities experience .
the princip@@ al difference is that the impact happen@@ s fas@@ ter in bon@@ ds than sto@@ cks when the F@@ ed changes course in policy .
for bon@@ ds , it does seem yi@@ elds change direction immediately as the first hi@@ ke / cut in the cy@@ cle arri@@ ves .
at the end of the hi@@ king cy@@ cle bon@@ d yi@@ elds fall immediately , " Deutsche said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b strate@@ g@@ ists believe the hi@@ ke in rates will cause yi@@ elds between longer - and sh@@ or@@ ter @ - @ dated bon@@ ds to move closer together , f@@ lat@@ ten@@ ing the cur@@ ve .
high @ - @ yi@@ eld bon@@ ds often perform better in such a climate , though " we are still ca@@ uti@@ ous about st@@ ret@@ ching for yi@@ eld , " Kath@@ y J@@ ones , fixed income analyst at Sch@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , J@@ ones thinks markets already have adap@@ ted to F@@ ed policy expectations .
" in addition to the streng@@ th in the dol@@ lar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has ad@@ jus@@ ted to the prospect of tigh@@ ter monetary policy , " she wrote .
short @ - @ term interest rates are up , the yi@@ eld cur@@ ve is f@@ latter , credit sp@@ read@@ s have wi@@ den@@ ed and v@@ ola@@ ti@@ li@@ ty has increased - all character@@ isti@@ cs of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens policy .
broad@@ ly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U@@ . S@@ . will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dol@@ lar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
" history shows that ' quality ' sto@@ cks ten@@ d to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hi@@ ke , " Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s analysts said in a report for cli@@ ents .
firms with strong balance s@@ he@@ ets out@@ p@@ ac@@ ed weak balance s@@ he@@ et companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hi@@ kes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low v@@ ola@@ ti@@ li@@ ty sto@@ cks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of flo@@ ating rate debt stand to lose the most , Gol@@ d@@ man said .
outside p@@ ure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dol@@ lar .
sa@@ vers could see gain@@ s as well through higher yi@@ elds at the , though experts di@@ ffer on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a cop@@ y of C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M says MP An@@ drew B@@ ing@@ ham
conservative MP An@@ drew B@@ ing@@ ham criticised station for ' d@@ umb@@ ing down '
argues it 's becoming increasingly in@@ dist@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from commercial rival
also took aim at the BBC Mu@@ sic A@@ wards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Br@@ its
colle@@ ague D@@ am@@ i@@ en Col@@ lin@@ s MP attacked The Vo@@ ice , saying that too was@@ n ' t original
BBC Radio 3 is " turning into " C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M , a leading MP has claimed , pil@@ ing fresh pressure on the broadcas@@ ter to prove that it does something that commercial broadcas@@ ters do not .
conservative MP An@@ drew B@@ ing@@ ham also told BBC bos@@ ses that the public service radio station appeared to be " d@@ umb@@ ing down " and is becoming increasingly in@@ dist@@ in@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from its commercial rival .
" Radio 3 seems to be - I don ' t like to use the word " d@@ umb@@ ing down " - but it seems to be turning into C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M , " he said .
he also took aim at the BBC Mu@@ sic A@@ wards , launched last December .
the BBC Mu@@ sic A@@ wards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
so , if you 're trying to do something different - those are two examp@@ les from the top of my head where you 're actually just mim@@ ic@@ king what is already on the market , " M@@ r B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about clas@@ sical music from any@@ where else .
and it 's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
" and also , Radio 3 's commitment to finding new music and com@@ mission@@ ing new works I think is also really important , " he said .
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 control@@ ler Al@@ an Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work har@@ der to eng@@ age audi@@ ences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less edu@@ cated about clas@@ sical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only ele@@ ment of the BBC 's output which came under fire for t@@ reading on the to@@ es of commercial ri@@ v@@ als , during the Culture , Media and S@@ port selec@@ t committee hearing .
T@@ ory MP D@@ am@@ i@@ en Col@@ lin@@ s attacked The Vo@@ ice - the mu@@ sical tal@@ ent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ p@@ a Media at an estimated cost of £ 2@@ 2@@ million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly dist@@ inc@@ tive ?
L@@ or@@ d H@@ all insisted that the B@@ B@@ C@@ 1 show - which st@@ ars Pal@@ om@@ a F@@ a@@ ith and bo@@ y George as judges - was produced " in a particularly BBC way . "
he added that he wants the Corporation to " find a hit from our own in @ - @ house stable " next time it laun@@ ches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out or@@ dering more series of The Vo@@ ice in the future , or spending lic@@ ence fe@@ e pay@@ ers ' money on other entertainment for@@ ma@@ ts .
internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since recor@@ ds began in 2000
online sales bol@@ ster@@ ed three years ago by the use of mobile for shop@@ ping
experts believe November 's Black Friday could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtu@@ al shop@@ ping has been bo@@ oming and turning many of Britain 's high streets into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are lev@@ el@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since recor@@ ds began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are lev@@ el@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
' I@@ f you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to rati@@ on@@ alise over time , ' Andy M@@ ul@@ ca@@ h@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Guardian .
he explained that online sales were bol@@ ster@@ ed three years ago when shop@@ p@@ ers started using their mobile ph@@ ones to make purch@@ as@@ es .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different con@@ tex@@ ts , such as on the SO@@ FA .
but now that is pla@@ te@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the Black Friday phenom@@ enon , which has been impor@@ ted from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slow@@ ing sales .
experts believe shop@@ p@@ ers could be holding off making purch@@ as@@ es ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of shop@@ p@@ ers f@@ loc@@ ked to their computers to sn@@ ap up deals cr@@ ash@@ ing a number of reta@@ il@@ ers web@@ sites .
experts believe Black Friday , which saw shop@@ p@@ ers fight over bar@@ gain@@ s , could be holding shop@@ p@@ ers off from making purch@@ as@@ es
research published by the British R@@ et@@ ail Con@@ sorti@@ um found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as T@@ V@@ s and w@@ ash@@ ing mach@@ ines , more than one third of purch@@ as@@ es are now done through web sto@@ res .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying c@@ lo@@ th@@ es and sho@@ es online , rather than using high street fas@@ hion cha@@ ins .
Muslims bur@@ y those killed in mec@@ ca cr@@ ane cr@@ ash as B@@ in La@@ den family sanc@@ tioned

the sad pos@@ session passed by the hol@@ y site , where just days earlier a construction cr@@ ane cr@@ as@@ hed through the ce@@ iling of the mosque and top@@ p@@ led onto wor@@ ship@@ ers .
the bodies were released for fun@@ eral as the S@@ au@@ di King sanc@@ tioned the B@@ in La@@ den family construction group over the disaster , which also left 3@@ 9@@ 4 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the wor@@ ship@@ ers killed when a cr@@ ane cr@@ as@@ hed collap@@ sed at mec@@ ca 's Grand Central Mos@@ que were carried through the streets
among the dead was father @ - @ of @ - @ four Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram , from B@@ ol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Man@@ ches@@ ter , who was on his first pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge when the cr@@ ane cr@@ as@@ hed down .
M@@ r Ak@@ ram had been in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual ha@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge .
S@@ au@@ di officials have already vowed that the ha@@ j@@ j to mec@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to des@@ c@@ end on the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin@@ la@@ din Group should not have left the cr@@ ane 's ar@@ m up when it was not in use .
an Ara@@ bic version of the dec@@ ree , carried by the state @ - @ run S@@ au@@ di Press Agency , said the Bin@@ la@@ din Group was part@@ ly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency 's English service did not report that deta@@ il , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travel@@ ling abroad .
earlier this week Sal@@ man vowed to reve@@ al what caused the cr@@ ane to top@@ ple into a cour@@ t@@ yar@@ d of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have con@@ ver@@ ged ahead of the ha@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge later this month .
Bin@@ la@@ din Group has not released any statements about the cr@@ ane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the ro@@ yal dec@@ ree also bla@@ med the group for not using up @ - @ to @ - @ date safety measures and failing to co@@ ordin@@ ate with me@@ teor@@ ological officials .
dozens of cr@@ an@@ es sur@@ round mec@@ ca 's Grand Mos@@ que , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ la@@ din Group .
the Bin@@ la@@ din family has been close to S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ bia 's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
al Q@@ ai@@ da 's late leader O@@ sa@@ ma bin La@@ den was a ren@@ eg@@ ade son dis@@ owned by the family in the 1990s .
the cr@@ ash came amid high win@@ ds and rain just days before millions arrive in the k@@ ing@@ dom for the pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge , which is required at least once in the life of every able @ - @ bo@@ died Muslim .
officials said 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million ri@@ y@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those perman@@ ently injured .

B & Q bos@@ s says Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men working che@@ ap is behind trend
Brit@@ ons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men says Ver@@ on@@ i@@ que La@@ ury
number of s@@ killed tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
resul@@ ting in 200 more S@@ cre@@ w@@ fi@@ x sto@@ res , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , opening
at same time K@@ ing@@ fis@@ her is closing 60 B & Q out@@ lets across the country
by Ru@@ per@@ t Steiner , Chief City Cor@@ respon@@ dent for the Daily Ma@@ il
Brit@@ ons are said to be putting down their ham@@ mers and pain@@ t@@ br@@ us@@ hes in favour of emplo@@ ying s@@ killed Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men to carry out work in their home
if you are hand@@ y with a ham@@ mer or a wh@@ iz@@ z at pain@@ ting wal@@ ls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because Brit@@ ons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the bos@@ s of the company behind B & Q@@ .
Ver@@ on@@ i@@ que La@@ ury , new chief executive of K@@ ing@@ fis@@ her , which ow@@ ns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of s@@ killed tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock @ - @ bot@@ tom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , K@@ ing@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more S@@ cre@@ w@@ fi@@ x sto@@ res , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B & Q out@@ lets .
Mr@@ s La@@ ury said she wants more women to be employed in B & Q shops because eight out of ten purch@@ asing decisions in st@@ ore are made by the fa@@ i@@ rer se@@ x .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demo@@ graphic trends which have seen more single female hous@@ ehol@@ ds who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mr@@ s La@@ ury said : " we still have a majority of men working in our sto@@ res .
we need to move more towards a balance .
funda@@ ment@@ ally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purch@@ ased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision @ - @ making process .
Mr@@ s La@@ ury , who is one of only five women at the hel@@ m of Britain 's F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restruc@@ tured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
K@@ ing@@ fis@@ her is almost alone in having exac@@ tly 50 per cent of its team st@@ aff@@ ed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mr@@ s La@@ ury said : " this was a con@@ sci@@ ous decision - di@@ versity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
K@@ ing@@ fis@@ her pos@@ ted a fall in both half @ - @ year profit and sales after the group sho@@ ul@@ dered the cost of sh@@ utting sto@@ res .

decision time on interest rates for US F@@ ederal Res@@ er@@ ve
the world is wat@@ ching as the US F@@ ederal Res@@ er@@ ve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists pol@@ led by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the F@@ ed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0 @ - @ 0.@@ 25 per@@ cent range .
it 's a historical event because it 's been seven years since the F@@ ed cut rates to zer@@ o .
for the first time we are appro@@ ac@@ hing a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zer@@ o bar and start a process of normal@@ iz@@ ation of interest rates , " said An@@ gel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
the US economy has been perfor@@ ming relatively well , the recovery adding tr@@ il@@ li@@ ons of dol@@ lar@@ s to the balance s@@ he@@ et and gener@@ ating little inflation .
however the F@@ ed can not ign@@ ore the less ros@@ y global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hi@@ ke but indic@@ ations are they also believe the od@@ ds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20@@ .@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
Del@@ ta State University sho@@ o@@ ter left note of ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colle@@ ague later that day - Shan@@ non lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was " sor@@ ry " for the first murder and w@@ ished he " could take it back , " authorities revealed Tuesday .
police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mis@@ s@@ . said lam@@ b , a geo@@ graphy and social science education in@@ struc@@ tor at Del@@ ta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a@@ .@@ m@@ .
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
lam@@ b told the dis@@ pat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said " I shot my wife last night " and also mentioned that there is a " swe@@ et do@@ g " in the house that is " not going to bo@@ ther anyone " but is likely up@@ set .
police asked the cal@@ ler his name , but he didn ' t give it .
lam@@ b did not provide an ex@@ plan@@ ation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from lam@@ b , 45 , that said : " I am so sor@@ ry I wish I could take it back .
I lov@@ ed A@@ my and she is the only person who ever lov@@ ed me .
after wr@@ iting the note , lam@@ b dro@@ ve 300 mil@@ es to Del@@ ta State where he killed E@@ than Sch@@ mid@@ t , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as c@@ ops closed in .
University President Wil@@ liam La@@ For@@ ge said he didn ' t know of any conflict between lam@@ b and Sch@@ mid@@ t but " obvi@@ ously there was something in Mr@@ . lam@@ b 's mind . "
despite reports Monday that lam@@ b allegedly believed P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was also ro@@ man@@ tically involved with Sch@@ mid@@ t , authorities said Tuesday that there was " no information , no evidence " of a " love tri@@ an@@ gle . "
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was described as a " good person " by S@@ ha@@ wn O ' Ste@@ en , who said he had been mar@@ ried to her for about seven years .
the two di@@ v@@ or@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O ' Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a da@@ ughter , who is 19 , and she was " dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted . "
he said P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and her da@@ ughter were " absol@@ u@@ tely best friends . "
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ no@@ w@@ les , identified as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s by the S@@ un Herald .
K@@ no@@ w@@ les said P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , who had a ho@@ und do@@ g named L@@ igh@@ t@@ ning , had been dating lam@@ b for about three years .
" she always wanted to help other people , " K@@ no@@ w@@ les said .
police said lam@@ b had ph@@ oned relatives at some point Monday to tell them " he 's not going to jail . "
when c@@ ops caught up with him on H@@ igh@@ way 1 near Gre@@ en@@ vil@@ le later that night , lam@@ b pul@@ led his car over , bail@@ ed out on fo@@ ot , ran into the wo@@ ods and shot and killed himself .
lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from Del@@ ta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume pos@@ ted on the university 's website .
st@@ ars who lost their mo@@ jo
the actor ( left ) , pic@@ tured with his son R@@ ed@@ mon@@ d ( right ) , has had a st@@ res@@ s@@ ful few years .
in 2001 , he batt@@ led le@@ uk@@ em@@ ia , and in 2009 , he lost long @ - @ time partner , Far@@ ra@@ h F@@ aw@@ c@@ et@@ t , to cancer .
the actor has also reportedly strugg@@ led with drugs , and in 2008 , he was b@@ us@@ ted for drug pos@@ session .

Man@@ ches@@ ter United 's Luk@@ e S@@ ha@@ w out for months with double f@@ rac@@ ture
Luk@@ e S@@ ha@@ w suffered a double f@@ rac@@ ture of his right le@@ g during Man@@ ches@@ ter United 's Cha@@ mp@@ ions League defeat at P@@ S@@ V E@@ in@@ d@@ h@@ ov@@ en .
while this left the full @ - @ back in te@@ ars and will rule him out for at least six months , L@@ ou@@ is van Ga@@ al remains hop@@ eful S@@ ha@@ w could play again this season .
the injur@@ y was caused by a rec@@ k@@ less tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ en@@ o in the 15th minute after the 20 @ - @ year @ - @ old S@@ ha@@ w had bur@@ st into the P@@ S@@ V area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the p@@ it@@ ch and required o@@ x@@ y@@ gen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : " he has a double le@@ g f@@ rac@@ ture and is in hospital . "
he will be transferred tom@@ or@@ row or may@@ be a day later and then oper@@ ated on in Man@@ ches@@ ter .
it is aw@@ ful - a bo@@ y who comes to Man@@ ches@@ ter United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fan@@ tas@@ tically and then this happen@@ s .
when it was in the d@@ ressing room he had an o@@ x@@ y@@ gen mas@@ k on .
he was cr@@ ying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double f@@ rac@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ en@@ o appeared fortun@@ ate to es@@ cape a red card and the con@@ cession of a sp@@ ot @ - @ kic@@ k .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ i , the refer@@ e@@ e , did not pen@@ alise the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an .
van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
you can judge for yo@@ ur@@ self when I say it is a penal@@ ty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two leg@@ s .
a t@@ we@@ et on S@@ ha@@ w 's account read : " than@@ k you everyone for your messages , words can ' t descri@@ be how g@@ ut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery star@@ ts now , I will come back stronger . "

for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was head@@ ing in a different direction , so it lo@@ oked like he [ Mor@@ en@@ o ] tou@@ ched it , but I co@@ uldn ' t see the tackle on Luk@@ e .

su@@ rely David Cam@@ er@@ on kno@@ ws The L@@ or@@ ax better than this ?
it 's one thing any par@@ ent soon lear@@ ns : when your child lov@@ es a book , it won ' t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are David Cam@@ er@@ on .
asked by a provi@@ der of holiday ch@@ ild@@ care sch@@ e@@ mes to name his favour@@ ite ki@@ ds ' book , the prime minister op@@ ted for The L@@ or@@ ax , the 197@@ 1 environmental f@@ able by D@@ r Se@@ us@@ s .
it was a difficult choice , Cam@@ er@@ on wri@@ tes in a message published on the website of the Su@@ per@@ C@@ amp@@ s company , continuing : " fun@@ ny , moving , cre@@ ative and with a powerful message , it 's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously mis@@ sed . "
all very well , except that the subsequ@@ ent par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h in which Cam@@ er@@ on sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly describ@@ es the plo@@ t of the book instead gives a pr@@ é@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new charac@@ ters and deta@@ il to p@@ ad out the fair@@ ly brief original text .
" set in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @ - @ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commo@@ di@@ ty , a bo@@ y named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dre@@ am gir@@ l , Au@@ dre@@ y , by fulfil@@ ling her wish to see a real t@@ ree , " it read@@ s , ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest un@@ known to D@@ r Se@@ us@@ s , real name The@@ odor Se@@ us@@ s Ge@@ isel , who died in 1991 .
if that was@@ n ' t suspic@@ ious enough , Cam@@ er@@ on 's submitted text read@@ s in part like a plo@@ t sum@@ mary of the L@@ or@@ ax film provided on the Internet Mov@@ ie dat@@ ab@@ ase website , which begins : " in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @ - @ Vil@@ le , where everything is arti@@ fic@@ ial and even the air is a commo@@ di@@ ty , a bo@@ y named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dre@@ am gir@@ l , Au@@ dre@@ y .

given he is an av@@ ow@@ ed@@ ly hands @ - @ on par@@ ent , it seems unlikely Cam@@ er@@ on is so un@@ fam@@ ili@@ ar with the book 's plo@@ t , in which a young un@@ named bo@@ y he@@ ars how the local environment was dev@@ as@@ ta@@ ted by the av@@ ar@@ ic@@ ious , t@@ ree @ - @ ch@@ op@@ ping , th@@ need @ - @ k@@ n@@ it@@ ting On@@ ce @ - @ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ ony@@ mous L@@ or@@ ax , a squ@@ at , m@@ ou@@ st@@ achi@@ o@@ ed cre@@ ature who " speaks for the tre@@ es .

most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly P@@ R task would have been out@@ sour@@ ced to an aide , seem@@ ingly one who has never read The L@@ or@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cam@@ er@@ on 's constitu@@ ency office .
Su@@ per@@ C@@ amp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cam@@ er@@ on 's staff , but had no further immediate comment .
A@@ dam L@@ y@@ th was clearly at risk of Eng@@ land omis@@ sion but it 's still tough

Al@@ as@@ ta@@ ir Co@@ ok 's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of sp@@ in in that bat@@ ting lin@@ e@@ up and the collective min@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful positi@@ v@@ ity .
with the ball , Mo@@ e@@ en Ali is developing as a sp@@ in@@ ner and A@@ dil Ras@@ hi@@ d , even if he is an un@@ known qu@@ anti@@ ty at T@@ est level , represents an attac@@ king option .

the decision to om@@ it A@@ dam L@@ y@@ th is obvi@@ ously a tough one for me to analy@@ se as his head coach at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
his seven T@@ ests have been against two good attacks in challen@@ ging conditions and the simple but har@@ s@@ h reality is that cri@@ c@@ ket@@ ers are ju@@ dged on output .
there were no question marks over Jo@@ e Ro@@ ot , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selec@@ tors .
a couple of half @ - @ centuries and L@@ y@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own dest@@ in@@ y .
hop@@ efully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire another opportunity will come along .
the Eng@@ land head coach , T@@ rev@@ or Bay@@ lis@@ s , praised his attitude even when he was not perfor@@ ming as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a T@@ est bat@@ sman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
L@@ y@@ th got seven cap@@ s - like S@@ am R@@ ob@@ son before him - while Nic@@ k Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
the only gri@@ pe you could have was that Eng@@ land went for Jon@@ a@@ than T@@ rot@@ t in the Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an first - when L@@ y@@ th was in top form - but that was@@ ted opportunity is in the past now .
A@@ le@@ x Hal@@ es comes in and he is a bat@@ sman I rate highly .
he is an X @ - @ factor cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire saw early this season when he made 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bri@@ dge p@@ it@@ ch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be affor@@ ded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make @ - @ up of the side in the U@@ A@@ E .
the idea of Mo@@ e@@ en opening the bat@@ ting al@@ ong@@ side Co@@ ok , which would get the ex@@ tra sp@@ in@@ ner in while keeping four quic@@ ks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don ' t see why a stro@@ kem@@ aker can not bat there and this left @ - @ han@@ der has already shown he is one hel@@ l of a cri@@ c@@ ke@@ ter .
Mo@@ e@@ en may not have done the job for his coun@@ ty , Wor@@ ces@@ ter@@ sh@@ ire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team @ - @ M@@ ate J@@ us@@ tin L@@ an@@ ger played his first 38 T@@ ests at first drop before ste@@ pping up to open in 2001 .
he pe@@ ele@@ d off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back @ - @ up sp@@ in@@ ner and , in my limited de@@ al@@ ings with him , he has stru@@ ck me as very impres@@ sive young man .
people may look at his ra@@ w stat@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ in@@ ners putting their hands up and selec@@ tors have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squ@@ ad , Eng@@ land look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d addi@@ tions to their co@@ ac@@ hing staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ den@@ e , the S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka bat@@ sman , as a consul@@ tant for the T@@ est mat@@ ches could be a mas@@ ter@@ stro@@ ke .
he is one of the game 's lov@@ eli@@ est blo@@ kes , who will bring a we@@ alth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ l@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the wh@@ ite @ - @ ball le@@ g of the tour and will bring both energy and a ru@@ th@@ less stre@@ ak into the set@@ up .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cri@@ c@@ ket , be it playing or co@@ ac@@ hing , and like Mah@@ ela has n@@ ous that can be tap@@ ped .
sometimes new voic@@ es in the d@@ ressing room , even if the messages are cons@@ istent with what has been said before , can fres@@ h@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly 's Dur@@ ham team @ - @ M@@ ate B@@ en st@@ ok@@ es is res@@ ted for the one @ - @ day@@ ers , Ro@@ ot was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the co@@ aches and selec@@ tors do not set the sch@@ ed@@ ule .
and you have to re@@ member , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken lightly .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ dr@@ ums by 20@@ 17
David Cam@@ er@@ on 's half @ - @ bak@@ ed rene@@ goti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deep@@ er into troub@@ le with every day that pass@@ es , even without the election of gen@@ ial Jerem@@ y " I@@ s it Y@@ es or N@@ o ? " Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the T@@ U@@ C c@@ utting up roug@@ h over Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have their Cor@@ b@@ y@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages too .
a European diplomat ch@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in as@@ sor@@ ted cris@@ es as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are f@@ ed up with Britain 's self @ - @ absor@@ bed agenda of di@@ visi@@ ve con@@ ces@@ sions and dis@@ rup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don ' t want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton for its annual be@@ an , the T@@ U@@ C decided it didn ' t want them either if they er@@ o@@ ded social protection .
we could even call it D@@ ave and George 's sel@@ fi@@ e agenda .
p@@ m and chan@@ cellor rock up to sum@@ mits or bilateral ses@@ sions in foreign cap@@ itals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local mon@@ ument , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it 's all about me .
my European PA@@ L , who wants an ou@@ tw@@ ard @ - @ looking Britain inside the EU tent - " D@@ on ' t leave us alone with France , " says Berlin - suggests that more short @ - @ si@@ gh@@ ted ministers and officials in some cap@@ itals have got to the point where they don ' t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany 's ca@@ uti@@ ously level @ - @ headed chan@@ cellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Ko@@ h@@ l ( 16 ) .
France 's Fran@@ ço@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de is facing re @ - @ election or re@@ pla@@ cement in 20@@ 17 .
he is a f@@ ad@@ ing force too .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ al@@ istic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
it 's hard to see them breaking a le@@ g to help the Sel@@ fi@@ e Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scot@@ land leaving the UK - something they don ' t want either because most have similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ den@@ cies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make de@@ liber@@ ately un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful remarks , SN@@ P @ - @ st@@ yle , during the UK 's 20@@ 17 referendum campaign to has@@ ten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my PA@@ L suggests .
" the rene@@ goti@@ ation was a fi@@ x " and " Britain got nothing of value out of the rene@@ goti@@ ation . "
the Europe@@ ans know to their cost how pre@@ d@@ atory F@@ le@@ et Street can be and how EU @ - @ scep@@ tic the ol@@ ig@@ arch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the T@@ ony Ben@@ n @ - @ in@@ sp@@ ired 19@@ 75 referendum which endorsed our 197@@ 3 entry by a rati@@ o of 2 : 1 .
they may di@@ mly re@@ member Boris John@@ son , the arch Euro @ - @ opportun@@ ist , making his name as an " EU stra@@ ight ban@@ an@@ as " Brussels correspondent in the early 9@@ 0s .
for all his fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ness E@@ d Mil@@ ib@@ and k@@ new who his en@@ em@@ ies were .
they included the med@@ ley of tax @ - @ sh@@ y ras@@ c@@ als , phone @ - @ hac@@ king foreigners and p@@ se@@ u@@ do non @ - @ d@@ oms who own most of our great newspapers .
actually T@@ ony Blair thought much the same about them , but re@@ alised that when you 're in a c@@ age with a R@@ and@@ y gor@@ il@@ la you have to pass the ban@@ an@@ as to dist@@ r@@ act it from having you for l@@ un@@ ch and again for te@@ a .
in fact Mil@@ ib@@ and was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in op@@ posing Cam@@ er@@ on 's referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conce@@ ded the principle over the EU 's ab@@ or@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get @ - @ out card .
the press never for@@ gave him that either .
but n@@ ice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at W@@ est@@ min@@ s@@ ter on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re @ - @ adop@@ ting Ne@@ il K@@ in@@ no@@ ck 's boycott Mur@@ do@@ ch strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mist@@ ake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to eng@@ age with the media , not with me , but certainly with An@@ drew Mar@@ r whose BBC SO@@ FA he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evol@@ ving .
he says he '@@ d like us to stay in a refor@@ med EU .
well , most people outside U@@ k@@ ip 's wo@@ ad @ - @ we@@ aring ten@@ den@@ cy and the w@@ il@@ der sho@@ res of T@@ ory little Eng@@ lan@@ der@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
it 's what Hil@@ ary " A Ben@@ n , but not a Ben@@ n@@ ite " Ben@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the bo@@ y S@@ c@@ out in him strugg@@ led not to ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's appointment of ab@@ r@@ asi@@ ve John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ el@@ l as sha@@ dow chan@@ cellor was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old da@@ d strugg@@ led on TV to be dis@@ lo@@ yal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary 's struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in " in all circumstances " - Ben@@ n 's ph@@ r@@ ase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ el@@ l was saying , nor what J@@ C told pe@@ ers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bot@@ tom @ - @ up , tou@@ ch@@ y @ - @ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n wants to conv@@ ey - re@@ member , he even tou@@ ched me - message discipl@@ ine remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ st@@ rom that is social media , a h@@ ot@@ bed of par@@ an@@ o@@ ia and bet@@ r@@ ay@@ al .
it 's fair enough not to give Cam@@ er@@ on a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour 's support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ el@@ l has said .
Sim@@ on J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ el@@ l and Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's basic equ@@ i@@ vo@@ cation about EU membership - cons@@ istent with their Ben@@ n@@ ite si@@ e@@ ge economy , anti @ - @ cap@@ it@@ alist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic discussion among lef@@ tw@@ ing dis@@ si@@ dents for whom the nar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central T@@ en@@ et of doc@@ tr@@ in@@ al squ@@ ab@@ ble@@ s .
as with his equ@@ i@@ vo@@ cation over Na@@ to - T@@ om Wat@@ son is ada@@ man@@ t that J@@ C won ' t campaign to qu@@ it - foreign diplomats will be obli@@ ged to try to make sense of it all for their mas@@ ters at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspic@@ ious voters too - on con@@ ces@@ sions to Britain when it may all be poin@@ t@@ less ?
the US is already pre@@ t@@ ty dis@@ appointed with the Br@@ its " fe@@ e@@ ble military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @ - @ c@@ utting T@@ ory government in power , as I was remin@@ ded at the launch of something called the British In@@ f@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health Eng@@ land e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes review
claims by a government @ - @ funded agency that e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes are 95 % less har@@ m@@ ful than smoking ar@@ ose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts wr@@ iting in the British Medi@@ cal Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) joined the L@@ an@@ c@@ et in critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health Eng@@ land ( P@@ H@@ E ) in its report on e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes .
P@@ H@@ E published the " land@@ mark " report last month , describing it as a " comprehensive review of the evidence . "
but several researchers have questi@@ oned the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an edi@@ tor@@ ial in the L@@ an@@ c@@ et medical journ@@ al last month attacked the " extra@@ ordin@@ arily f@@ lim@@ sy foundation " on which P@@ H@@ E based its main conclusion .
wr@@ iting in the B@@ M@@ J , two further researchers have questi@@ oned whether the claims were " built on rock or s@@ and . "
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ gi@@ ene and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medi@@ cine , and Sim@@ on Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of cl@@ in@@ ical ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ po@@ ol , said : " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effec@@ tiveness . "
they said the public would expect P@@ H@@ E 's claims that " the current best esti@@ mate is that e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes are around 95 % less har@@ m@@ ful than smoking " would be based on a deta@@ iled review of evidence and model@@ ling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi @ - @ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ C@@ DA ) model to syn@@ th@@ es@@ ise their opinions on the har@@ ms associ@@ ated with different nic@@ ot@@ ine @ - @ con@@ taining products ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said one spon@@ sor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ co for an independent study .
he also endorsed B@@ AT 's public health cre@@ denti@@ als in a sustain@@ ability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e @ - @ cigar@@ ette manufac@@ tu@@ rer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the rati@@ on@@ ale for selec@@ ting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e @ - @ cigar@@ ette champ@@ ions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their exper@@ ti@@ se in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at P@@ H@@ E .
the research paper produced by the group " tel@@ l@@ ingly conce@@ des " there is a lack of " hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , " Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , none of these links or limit@@ ations are discussed in the P@@ H@@ E report .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said P@@ H@@ E 's claims that " there is no evidence so far that e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non @ - @ sm@@ ok@@ ers " were pre@@ ma@@ ture .
Pr@@ of K@@ ev@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and wel@@ l@@ being at P@@ H@@ E , said the claims in the B@@ M@@ J had been responded to before .
he said : " e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes are significantly less har@@ m@@ ful than smoking . "
one in two lif@@ el@@ ong sm@@ ok@@ ers dies from their addi@@ ction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes are small by compar@@ ison , but we must continue to study the long @ - @ term effects .
P@@ H@@ E has a clear duty to infor@@ m the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public conf@@ u@@ sion about the rela@@ tive dan@@ gers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people a year di@@ e of a smoking @ - @ related ill@@ ness and smoking costs the N@@ H@@ S £ 2@@ b@@ n a year .
by sp@@ el@@ ling out clearly the current evidence - that while e @ - @ cigar@@ et@@ tes are not risk @ - @ free , they carry only a f@@ rac@@ tion of the har@@ m caused by smoking - we are fulfil@@ ling our national re@@ mit .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says former Chan@@ nel 4 chief
the former Chan@@ nel 4 chairman Luk@@ e John@@ son has said the BBC should stop broadcas@@ ting programmes such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders and The Vo@@ ice , saying its commercial ri@@ v@@ als would " give their right ar@@ m " for hit shows such as the Albert S@@ qu@@ are so@@ ap .
John@@ son said the lic@@ ence fe@@ e should only be used to make the sor@@ t of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcas@@ ters .
he criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be wat@@ ched by a smaller audience in tough s@@ lots against its ri@@ v@@ als " biggest rating shows , and on chan@@ n@@ els such as B@@ B@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC 's director general , T@@ ony H@@ all , said the cor@@ poration wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , John@@ son said he had tried for six years in his time at Chan@@ nel 4 to do a ti@@ e @ - @ up with the BBC without success .
" I do struggle with the idea that the BBC com@@ missions and broadcas@@ ts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ v@@ als , " John@@ son told the House of L@@ or@@ ds communication committee , as part of its in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into the future of the BBC .
if you keep the lic@@ ence fe@@ e , which I 'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others ar@@ en ' t making and com@@ mission@@ ing .
they broadcast The Vo@@ ice in a prime s@@ lot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a j@@ oke , it 's lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us , it 's obvi@@ ously n@@ on@@ sense .
John@@ son said : " I don ' t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsi@@ dy .
the Vo@@ ice is one , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mit@@ tedly made in @ - @ house .
f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly other chan@@ n@@ els would give their right ar@@ m for it .
I struggle to see how it 's public service broadcas@@ ting .
I don ' t think that would di@@ min@@ ish the BBC at all .
John@@ son , a ser@@ ial entrepren@@ e@@ ur who led Chan@@ nel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ asing ratings " because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long @ - @ term support . "
his comments about the BBC 's most popular shows ech@@ o those of former Sk@@ y executive T@@ ony B@@ all , who used his Mac@@ T@@ ag@@ gar@@ t lec@@ ture in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh in 2003 to propos@@ e that the BBC sell off shows such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders .
John@@ son said the BBC 's more nic@@ he public service programmes " go on to B@@ B@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can ' t measure the audience but they fulfil their re@@ mit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious missions about jus@@ tif@@ ying £ 4@@ b@@ n in lic@@ ence fe@@ e income , " Wel@@ l of course , we do all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one wat@@ ched . "
they put them on a s@@ lot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the lic@@ ence fe@@ e , John@@ son told the committee : " I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I won@@ der if they do because they don ' t consum@@ e a lot of the BBC .
former Sk@@ y and Chan@@ nel 5 executive David El@@ ste@@ in , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should re@@ vis@@ e its Re@@ ith@@ ian mission to " infor@@ m , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . "
he said little of the BBC 's output was now formally clas@@ si@@ fied as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.@@ 1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcas@@ ters in Australia and Canada and change it to " infor@@ m , en@@ ligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . "
on the issue of part@@ ner@@ ships , El@@ ste@@ in said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a hand@@ ful were shown on TV , and enter into al@@ li@@ ances with commercial broadcas@@ ters to make them all available to watch online .

" they 've done a fan@@ tas@@ tic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair , " says T@@ om Dav@@ ies at Am@@ nes@@ ty .
what we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally tra@@ ded on our do@@ or@@ step .
perhaps the most cre@@ ative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside exc@@ el , where exhibi@@ tors flo@@ g fan@@ tas@@ tically e@@ up@@ hem@@ istic products .
in a press release , Sa@@ a@@ b revealed an order from the US army for " the sho@@ ul@@ der @ - @ launched AT@@ 4@@ C@@ S RS . "
this includes a " unique shap@@ ed @ - @ charge war@@ head that deli@@ vers outstanding behind @ - @ ar@@ m@@ our @ - @ effects inside the target . "
whatever that does , it won ' t be ple@@ as@@ ant .
eight gol@@ den rules for living in student hal@@ ls
it 's been 11 years since I moved into student hal@@ ls as an obli@@ vi@@ ous 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old , still believ@@ ing in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ al rela@@ ti@@ vis@@ m , but it 's only now I rec@@ all the stra@@ ined s@@ mil@@ es of those I anno@@ yed - and the numerous , len@@ g@@ th@@ y complaints about others .
most of what I lear@@ ned can be dis@@ til@@ led into eight simple rules .
moving into hal@@ ls can range from mil@@ dly ner@@ ve @ - @ rac@@ king to tot@@ ally ter@@ rif@@ ying .
it 's temp@@ ting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you 're from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n and why you " hon@@ est@@ ly neither love nor h@@ ate Mar@@ m@@ ite because seriously g@@ uy@@ s it 's just ye@@ ast ex@@ tr@@ act H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A I 'll be in my room . "
take a bre@@ ath .
and help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
it ste@@ ers the con@@ vers@@ ation and hel@@ ps you to S@@ c@@ out out the people you like ver@@ sus those you wo@@ uldn ' t talk to even if your ey@@ el@@ ashes were on fire and they were dis@@ pen@@ sing ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish@@ ers .
give people space .
people 's ro@@ oms often mor@@ p@@ h into dr@@ in@@ ks rec@@ ep@@ tions , movie @ - @ night ven@@ ues and commun@@ al han@@ g@@ out sp@@ ots , but they 're also where people get d@@ ressed and ad@@ just their under@@ we@@ ar .
related : don ' t even think about starting university in a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts get a ra@@ w deal at university .
your room should be a re@@ tre@@ at , yet many hal@@ ls form an inter @ - @ room @ - @ str@@ ol@@ ling culture that 's friendly , social and con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to lif@@ el@@ ong friend@@ ships .
that can be hel@@ l for someone who 's trying to re@@ charge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , " I like you and I want our friend@@ ship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I 've expen@@ ded on inter@@ acting with you . "
try to sense when a fellow student is ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted from soci@@ alising - and may@@ be text instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
one gu@@ y in my student hal@@ ls had a policy that if a door was@@ n ' t loc@@ ked he was invited in .
he saw some things .
make friends through bak@@ ing .
since you 're starting U@@ ni at the he@@ ight of bak@@ e @ - @ O@@ ff man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on people 's doors to introduce yo@@ ur@@ self with a pla@@ te of bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es seems mar@@ gin@@ ally less we@@ ir@@ d , less 19@@ 5@@ 0s " Wel@@ come to the neighbour@@ hood , I bak@@ ed you something , now sm@@ ile as I ask you personal questions . "
offering home@@ made tre@@ ats is a great way to make friends .
your hous@@ e@@ ma@@ tes will feel obli@@ ged to ch@@ at , and may end up associ@@ ating your face with a tas@@ ty surprise .
obvi@@ ously this is subject to you being a dec@@ ent bak@@ er .
po@@ or@@ ly @ - @ f@@ used lum@@ ps of fl@@ our , su@@ gar and f@@ at are more likely to make people pre@@ ten@@ d to be as@@ le@@ ep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student hal@@ ls .
obvi@@ ously nic@@ king some@@ ones ch@@ ic@@ ken is the@@ ft , but is taking a drop of milk for your te@@ a ste@@ aling ?
double chec@@ k with the milk owner .
chances are they 'll tell you to help yo@@ ur@@ self even if they 're se@@ eth@@ ing inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stu@@ ff , it 's anno@@ ying and you have my sy@@ mp@@ ath@@ ies - but try to deal with it more ma@@ tu@@ rely than my hal@@ l@@ mate , who tain@@ ted her milk with w@@ ash@@ ing @ - @ up liqu@@ id to pun@@ ish those who st@@ ole it .
she 's in jail now .
you sho@@ uldn ' t make no@@ ise that ke@@ ep@@ s people from s@@ le@@ eping or stu@@ d@@ ying .
this is@@ n ' t just to be a dec@@ ent human , but because you are the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al people in g@@ las@@ s houses .
a gir@@ l on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbour if they wo@@ uldn ' t mind turning down the dru@@ m and bas@@ s because it was 3 am and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .
they responded by turning it up .
when they finally shut up at 5 am , she kin@@ dly let them s@@ le@@ ep for two hours before b@@ lasting her own music , loc@@ king her door as she left for her three @ - @ hour ex@@ am .
wo@@ uldn ' t it be ro@@ man@@ tic if your future sp@@ o@@ use happened to move into the same h@@ all as you ?
Con@@ ver@@ sel@@ y , wo@@ uldn ' t it be k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ le @ - @ bit@@ ingly aw@@ k@@ ward if you mist@@ o@@ ok a hal@@ l@@ mate for your future sp@@ o@@ use , ho@@ oked up , broke up and had to see them every day and pos@@ sibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends ?
of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a ho@@ t hal@@ l@@ mate is defin@@ itely not your future sp@@ o@@ use , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .
in the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment you realise someone 's left their ke@@ ys inside their un@@ loc@@ ked room , the line between pr@@ an@@ king and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good pr@@ an@@ k is fun@@ ny , but takes mom@@ ents to rever@@ se .
te@@ ach a valu@@ able and am@@ using les@@ son about security by hiding something - but never tr@@ ash someone 's room with to@@ o@@ th@@ pas@@ te and s@@ ham@@ po@@ o .
lock their door and put their ke@@ ys in a g@@ las@@ s of water , which you then put in the fre@@ ez@@ er - but don ' t B@@ lu @ - @ T@@ ack their pos@@ ses@@ sions to the ce@@ iling more than twice .

her heart stopped while becoming be@@ auti@@ ful
Ra@@ qu@@ el San@@ to@@ s ( 28 ) , a mother of two living in R@@ io de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o , consul@@ ted a plas@@ tic sur@@ ge@@ on last Monday to er@@ ase the la@@ ughter lines around her m@@ outh .

she then suffered a heart attack and died .
the police are now investig@@ ating whether the medicine she used daily , " Pot@@ en@@ ay , " played any role in her death .
the actual cause of death will become clear after the aut@@ op@@ sy .

oil companies officially collap@@ sed
an investment of 400 billion dol@@ lar@@ s was shel@@ ved and most deep @ - @ sea oil expl@@ oration projects were suspended between 2014 , when oil prices started to drop , and the end of last year .
according to research from the consul@@ ting company Wo@@ od Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie , low oil prices were the cause of the suspen@@ sion of the 3@@ 80 billion dol@@ lar @ - @ project for oil and gas expl@@ oration / production , and the production of millions of bar@@ re@@ ls of oil was postponed in a v@@ ast area reaching from the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an G@@ ul@@ f to Africa .
the report showing that the biggest reason for the price drop is that oil prices have fal@@ len from their 2014 level of 1@@ 15 dol@@ lar@@ s to their lowest level in the last 12 years , losing more than 70 per@@ cent of their value in 1.5 years , includes the statement that " company bud@@ gets have dra@@ matically sh@@ run@@ k . "
400 billion dol@@ lar@@ s O@@ N hold
while the cru@@ de oil price continues to surprise every single day , it has recently fal@@ len under the 30 dol@@ lar mark , which is its lowest level in the last 12 years .
in these days of he@@ ated deb@@ ates about " whether the price of oil can fall below 15 dol@@ lar@@ s , " or " whether oil is dir@@ t che@@ ap , " the research published by the energy consul@@ ting firm Wo@@ od Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie reve@@ als how the sector has been affected by the fal@@ ling prices .
suggesting that the fal@@ ling oil prices caused the suspen@@ sion of 46 big energy investments worth 200 billion dol@@ lar@@ s in a report published in July , Wo@@ od Mac@@ ken@@ z@@ ie , in new research , dis@@ closed what the total figure was up to the end of 2015 .
according to this , while 22 more projects were postponed in the last six months of 2015 , a total of 68 projects were suspended from 2014 , when the drop in oil prices began .
the value of these projects is estimated at around 400 billion dol@@ lar@@ s .
2.@@ 9 million bar@@ re@@ ls P@@ E@@ R day
in the research , it has been under@@ lined that the low oil prices had a " bru@@ tal " effect on company plans and it has been noted that the projects most affected were deep water development projects .
the suspended projects correspon@@ d to a total reser@@ ve of 27 billion bar@@ re@@ ls of cru@@ de oil , and the daily production of 2.@@ 9 million bar@@ re@@ ls has therefore been delayed until 20@@ 25 .
according to the research , the final investment decision for most of the af@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned projects was later shel@@ ved until 20@@ 17 , and the first production goals are tar@@ get@@ ing the years between 2020 and 20@@ 23 .
the report under@@ lines that the postponed 68 projects include a potential 1@@ 70 billion dol@@ lar investment that is predic@@ ted to be carried out in the next 5 years , and " most of the 1@@ 70 billion dol@@ lar@@ s is com@@ prised of deep water projects . "
the reason for this is the high preliminary investment costs .
it is said that " 70 per@@ cent of the deep @ - @ sea expendi@@ ture is made up in particular of oil based projects in Ni@@ ger@@ ia , An@@ g@@ ola and the M@@ ex@@ ic@@ an G@@ ul@@ f in the U@@ . S@@ . "
according to the research , the countries having the biggest number of suspended projects are Canada , An@@ g@@ ola , Kazak@@ h@@ stan , Ni@@ ger@@ ia , Norway and the U@@ . S@@ .
these six countries have almost 90 per@@ cent of the suspended liqu@@ id ( oil ) reserves .
Mo@@ zam@@ bi@@ que , Australia , Mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a and In@@ don@@ es@@ ia account for the biggest number of suspended gas reserves with 85 per@@ cent of the total .
most of the natural gas waiting to be ex@@ tr@@ acted lies in deep waters , and requires complex and expensive solutions such as building a liqu@@ ef@@ ied natural gas ( L@@ N@@ G ) plant from s@@ cr@@ at@@ ch .
it has been stated that the most en@@ danger@@ ed companies are the oil gi@@ ants having suc@@ cessive under@@ tak@@ ings in the Can@@ adi@@ an oil San@@ ds and the Cas@@ p@@ ian Sea Regi@@ on , and it is said that these companies are trying to adap@@ t to the scenar@@ io of " lower for longer " oil prices .
ey@@ es O@@ N Iran
just four years ago the situation was as follows : the U@@ . S@@ . and Europe imposed an embar@@ go on Iran oil to stop T@@ eh@@ ran 's nuclear program ; the bar@@ rel price of oil was around 110 dol@@ lar@@ s and debate cent@@ red on how Iran 's oil exports would be cut without ca@@ using any sharp jum@@ p in the prices .
when we return to this week , we witness a very different scenar@@ io .
oil prices have fal@@ len below 30 dol@@ lar@@ s for the first time since 2004 , and the princip@@ al cause of this was the production bo@@ om in the U@@ . S@@ . ; and embar@@ goes imposed on Iran being abol@@ ished .
for this reason , all the ey@@ es are on Iran .
if Iran increases its oil exports , more oil will be added to the market , which is said to be already quite full .
this may cause the price to fall below even the sur@@ prising levels of today .
some analysts are saying that S@@ au@@ di Ara@@ bia , not w@@ an@@ ting to lose any market share to Iran , will p@@ um@@ p more oil and Iran and S@@ . Ara@@ bia will enter a price war .
soon after the elimin@@ ation of the enfor@@ c@@ ements , it is stated that the princip@@ al targets of Iran are India , being the fas@@ test growing oil market in Asia , and its old partners in Europe .
Iranian officials have previously said that they aimed to increase initial exports by 500 thous@@ and bar@@ re@@ ls a day and to ad@@ d the same amount to the market after a while .
according to the map data from Reuters , there are 22 very large cru@@ de carri@@ ers ( V@@ L@@ C@@ C ) waiting off the coast of Iran , 13 of which are fully or mostly lo@@ aded .
Iran is in the position of being the country with the fourth biggest pro@@ ven oil reserves in the world .
thanks to excep@@ tions within the embar@@ go , Iran currently exports approximately 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls of cru@@ de oil to some countries including Turkey .
before the embar@@ go , Iran 's daily oil export increased to 3 million bar@@ re@@ ls a day .
a research speci@@ alist at sec@@ ur@@ ities company Des@@ tek Men@@ k@@ ul Değ@@ er@@ ler , Ay@@ sun Gö@@ k@@ su , ans@@ wers the question of whether oil will fall below 20 dol@@ lar@@ s as follows : " China @ - @ cent@@ red global growth concerns increase down@@ ward pressure on commo@@ di@@ ty prices and intensi@@ fi@@ es the drop in oil prices . "
we are seeing that losses reached 20 per@@ cent since the beginning of the year amid concerns that the demand for oil would decline in line with the economic slow@@ down in China , which is the biggest oil impor@@ ter in the world .
in addition to this , we may witness oil prices below 30 dol@@ lar@@ s in the for@@ th@@ coming days due to the effects of the global appreci@@ ation of the dol@@ lar and the problem of global ex@@ cess supply .
as long as we do not see any permanent pri@@ cing above the 32 @ - @ 33 dol@@ lar @ - @ level , the up@@ ward movement of oil prices may remain limited and the down@@ ward pressure on prices may increase .
at that point , we can say that closing prices under the 30 dol@@ lar @ - @ level will play a key role in the continu@@ ation of the decline .
in this situation , it should be no surprise if it is seen that there is a lo@@ os@@ ening of the support level of 2@@ 3.@@ 30 @ - @ 25@@ .@@ 60 in the lower end .
Is@@ ham Sar@@ dou@@ k : " the era of an@@ gel@@ s is now over ! "
while carrying out the duty of trend creation in W@@ GS@@ N , which determin@@ es the fas@@ hion trends of Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's Sec@@ ret and the world ; why did you change your course to Turkey ?
- I am always pro @ - @ change .
I was born in Paris , lived in London , and after that went to New York .
I took up key positions there .
meanwhile , I started to provide consul@@ tan@@ cy services to Kot@@ on over the last two years .
after that I saw the potential in this area and the br@@ and Kot@@ on .
I real@@ ized that everything needed to be a worldwide chain st@@ ore was there .
now I 'm here to make it happen .
can you achieve this in a short time ?
- sure .
even though it is a small br@@ and , it is already sold in 50 countries .
we launch 50 collec@@ tions every year , we have 15 different sec@@ tions .
in other words , there is everything a chain st@@ ore needs to have .
we can respond to the needs of the consumers in different areas from Dub@@ ai to Moscow .
currently , we are opening a st@@ ore in Paris in May , and it is the beginning of a new and ex@@ citing era ...
is it a must to open a st@@ ore in Paris ?
- Y@@ es .
it is not because the economic situation in Europe is great .
however , you open some sto@@ res for image .
you have sto@@ res in fas@@ hion cap@@ itals such as Paris , London and you make money in the Middle East .
one of them adds presti@@ ge to the br@@ and and the other adds money ; both of them are necessary for a br@@ and making an effort to be global .
O@@ K , so let 's talk about the trends ...
- We have a ro@@ man@@ tic and chi@@ c season ahead of us .
fl@@ ying chi@@ ff@@ on d@@ resses , s@@ mo@@ ot@@ h ton@@ es , p@@ in@@ ks , wh@@ i@@ tes , re@@ ds .
design@@ s ...
we are experi@@ en@@ cing har@@ s@@ h and bru@@ tal times ; the fas@@ hion world always brings chi@@ c and heart @ - @ war@@ ming design@@ s to the po@@ di@@ um and tries to ad@@ d a tin@@ y bit of happ@@ iness to life in times like this .
what we are doing is the same .
for this reason , the " era of ele@@ g@@ ance " is returning in the new season .
let 's go back to your years in Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's Sec@@ ret .
who was the most legen@@ dary an@@ gel ? - Kar@@ ol@@ ina Kur@@ kova .
I am not talking about her gor@@ ge@@ ous phy@@ si@@ que : she is so positive and she is such a good gir@@ l !
while working , she sat bes@@ ide me and said " Ar@@ e you hun@@ gr@@ y , hon@@ ey ? " and gave me an app@@ le , et@@ c .
in a word , she was so swe@@ et .
you also know what I am talking about , I lo@@ oked into you and discovered that you have done lots of inter@@ views with all the mode@@ ls of Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's Sec@@ ret .
Kar@@ ol@@ ina is so be@@ auti@@ ful , is@@ n ' t she ?
but Adri@@ ana L@@ ima also impres@@ sed me with her be@@ a@@ uty ...
- Y@@ ou have a point , but that voice !
her voice , her in@@ ton@@ ation ...
it st@@ resses you after a while and you say , " sit some@@ where and look be@@ auti@@ ful ; do nothing else ! "
it can ir@@ r@@ itate .
yes , you can experience these kin@@ ds of sho@@ cks .
I done an interview with Can@@ di@@ ce Sw@@ an@@ e@@ po@@ el .
she was the most be@@ auti@@ ful gir@@ l I 've ever seen in my life but I was ast@@ on@@ ished by her emp@@ ty @ - @ he@@ ade@@ d@@ ness .
- M@@ ost of them are like that .
the new an@@ gel@@ s are not like in the past ...
I re@@ member the time of G@@ is@@ ele ...
it was quite hard to work with her though .
she used to come back@@ stage and sm@@ oke like a ch@@ im@@ ney .
it was not because she is addi@@ c@@ ted .
nobody can sm@@ oke you see , only she can sm@@ oke !
it is just to be a " di@@ va . "
broadcast two months ago , the Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's Sec@@ ret fas@@ hion par@@ ade got the lowest rating in its history .
why do you think that is ?
- A@@ s I said , that legen@@ dary era of be@@ auti@@ ful an@@ gel@@ s is now over .
par@@ don me , who needs G@@ ig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d ?
what is be@@ auti@@ ful about her ?
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , for example , she is as fla@@ t as a board ...
there are no cur@@ ves , there is nothing .
K@@ ate mos@@ s is not cur@@ v@@ y either but she became the biggest name in the fas@@ hion industry .
- I@@ t is true but her face was so be@@ auti@@ ful .
I want to use my right to obj@@ ect .
last year , I did an interview with her ; her face has g@@ ot@@ ten quite old ...
- B@@ et@@ ween smoking and alco@@ hol , she n@@ atur@@ ally lost her be@@ a@@ uty .
but she had such a be@@ auti@@ ful face in the n@@ in@@ e@@ ties .
her li@@ ps were like Bri@@ git@@ te Bar@@ do@@ t 's .
she represents the end of the super@@ model era .
the era of Linda E@@ van@@ gel@@ ist@@ a , Na@@ om@@ i C@@ amp@@ bel@@ l and Christ@@ y Tur@@ l@@ ington ...
Christ@@ y was my next door @ - @ neighbour and I saw her without mak@@ e@@ up .
there can not be such p@@ ure be@@ a@@ uty , there can not be such ele@@ g@@ ance .
what about C@@ ara D@@ ele@@ v@@ ing@@ ne ?
- S@@ he 's was@@ ting her@@ self .
there is no need to be involved in every campaign .
people get bo@@ red .
besides , there is no hun@@ ger for " famous mode@@ ls and cele@@ bri@@ ties " like in the past .
people want to see real faces like their own faces in the campaigns .
we will go towards this .
because the trend is this .
a letter to Turkey from 25 auth@@ ors
according to reports from BBC Turkish , writ@@ ers from the Wor@@ ldwide Association of W@@ rit@@ ers ( P@@ E@@ N ) , including its presidents in Eng@@ land , Wal@@ es and Scot@@ land , stated that threats and phy@@ sical attacks against their colleagues , writ@@ ers and publis@@ h@@ ers in Turkey have become a normal part of life .
in the letter , the investigations and detention of journalists in Turkey were regar@@ ded as wor@@ rying developments as well as the two attacks on the Hurriyet daily newspaper , the raid on the Koz@@ a Group and detention of Vice News correspon@@ dents .
part @ - @ time work rights for mo@@ thers ca@@ uses debate
Türk @ - @ İş says " We think that part @ - @ time rights have been given to mo@@ thers to bring in labour for h@@ ire . "
" it may be a Tro@@ jan hor@@ se , " and T@@ İ@@ SK claimed " We are wor@@ ried about whether this regulation on behalf of women will prevent women from work or not . "
new rights planned for civil ser@@ van@@ ts and working women after giving birth or adoption were passed by the committee after day long negotiations .
" labour for h@@ ire " became the main topic in the committee negotiations of the regulations , which will bring the right of part @ - @ time work or un@@ paid leave to 6 months after giving birth and part @ - @ time work up until primary school age for the child .
while stat@@ ing that it is proper to rec@@ ru@@ it on a part @ - @ time basis until the child star@@ ts primary school they still have wor@@ ries , a CHP deputy of Iz@@ mir Mus@@ a Ç@@ am added , " I@@ f you bring the labour for h@@ ire regulation , we will stand against it to the bit@@ ter end . "
taking part in the ne@@ go@@ tions on behalf of Türk @ - @ İş and saying they have the same wor@@ ries , En@@ is Bağ@@ da@@ di@@ oğlu stated , " We have doubts about how the places for part @ - @ time working women will be fil@@ led . "
adding that if labour for h@@ ire is added to the agenda again on this occas@@ ion there will be matters much more proble@@ matic than su@@ b @ - @ contr@@ acted labour , Bağ@@ da@@ di@@ oğlu said , " We will watch the developments related to private employment agencies with much concern . "
the general secretary of T@@ İ@@ SK , B@@ ül@@ ent P@@ irler stated that part @ - @ time work for a period of 5 years came about with this law , and he added , " Th@@ ere is no part @ - @ time work for such a long period in other countries . "
also look at the matter this way .
" it is necessary to think about the consequences of this implementation in places having 1 or 2 employees . "
T@@ O@@ BB advis@@ or Ahmet Ş@@ ağ@@ ar also said that there will be problems finding workers if the regulation is implemented .
adding that there is no legislation related to the rules to be implemented on part @ - @ time work , Ş@@ ağ@@ ar stated , " Em@@ plo@@ yers and employees should come to an agreement until regulations related to private employment agencies have been made . "
M@@ etin F@@ ey@@ zi@@ oğlu : we don ' t support it
the statement from F@@ ey@@ zi@@ oğlu is as follows : " we don ' t stand by this declaration ; it is not possible for us to stand by and support it . "
because there is@@ n ' t one sentence of criticism against the PKK .
you co@@ uldn ' t say anything un@@ favourable , even one sentence against this separ@@ ati@@ st terror organiz@@ ation , the PKK ; they are considered above blame .
they are only har@@ s@@ h expres@@ sions to the state ; we don ' t take those who used them seriously or find them s@@ inc@@ ere .
we are legal experts , we are lawyers .
if there is any illegal behavi@@ our from representatives of the state , public officials and security forces in this context , let us go after it .
when we say " don ' t dem@@ ol@@ ish the state " to the separ@@ ati@@ sts or the re@@ lic@@ s of the period of tru@@ ce who sy@@ mp@@ ath@@ ise and ro@@ man@@ tic@@ ise the separ@@ ati@@ sts , they attack by calling us " separ@@ ati@@ st , fas@@ c@@ ist . "
when we say , " this state should be@@ have in accordance with the law and should always value the law most , " they say , " you are acting as a separ@@ ati@@ st " to us .
we are a bridge .
we are the people who are obli@@ ged to always tell the truth .

who is Ber@@ gen ?
Ber@@ gen , whose real name is Bel@@ gin Sar@@ ıl@@ mış@@ er , was born in Mer@@ sin on July 16 , 19@@ 60 .
when her parents di@@ v@@ or@@ ced in 19@@ 66 , she sett@@ led in Ankara with her mother S@@ eb@@ ah@@ at Ç@@ ak@@ ır .
after attending Yen@@ ima@@ hal@@ le Yun@@ us Em@@ re Pri@@ mary School , she entered the Pi@@ ano Department of Ankara State Con@@ serv@@ atory , but left because of financial difficulties and worked at the post office for a while by lying about her age .
she accepted an offer of work after she took to the stage in the F@@ ey@@ man N@@ ight Club where she went for a night out with friends in 197@@ 9 .

she released her L@@ P " I H@@ ave an a@@ x@@ e to gr@@ ind " with the record company At@@ las P@@ lak in 198@@ 2 .
while she was making her break@@ through in her arti@@ sti@@ c life , Ber@@ gen had to cop@@ e with a violent hus@@ band and she es@@ cap@@ ed from him many times .
in October 198@@ 2 while working in İz@@ mir , ac@@ id was thro@@ wn in her face under the orders of her hus@@ band .
having lost an eye and suffer@@ ing bur@@ ns to much of her body , Ber@@ gan was per@@ su@@ aded to return to the stage by Cen@@ gi@@ z Öz@@ şek@@ er after her treatment , who is the com@@ pos@@ er of the song " Wh@@ o kno@@ ws ? " popular@@ ised by Ki@@ bar@@ iye .

they will be de@@ por@@ ted with bi@@ cy@@ c@@ les
however , the refugees , most of whom are Syri@@ ans , will have to return to Russia by p@@ ed@@ alling in min@@ us 20 de@@ gre@@ es because the two countries could not reach an agreement .
a group of refugees went to Russia by plan@@ e , travel@@ led to the north of the country and went to Norway from Mur@@ man@@ s@@ k because it is saf@@ er and che@@ aper during the summer months .
as the agreement between the two countries does not allow crossing of the border on fo@@ ot , the refugees cros@@ sed the border by bi@@ cy@@ cle .
Norway has now decided to return these refugees .
for this reason , the Norway Police ordered the rep@@ air of the bi@@ cy@@ c@@ les that were aband@@ oned after crossing the border .
" 3 billion euros to Turkey " crisis in EU
the crisis is continuing with 3 billion euros pledged to Turkey for the refugees .
the President of the European Commission , Jean C@@ lau@@ de J@@ unc@@ ker , criticised the Prime Minister of Italy , Mat@@ te@@ o Ren@@ zi 's blocking of the funds to be transferred to Turkey .
stat@@ ing that the mo@@ od between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good , J@@ unc@@ ker under@@ lined that the EU has to find the 3 billion euros .
J@@ unc@@ ker said " T@@ his money is not for Turkey , but for Syrian refugees in Turkey . "
we have not yet reached 3 billion .
" this is an issue related to the credi@@ bility of the EU and is therefore very important , " he said .
J@@ unc@@ ker stated that he expected the money to be completed by January 26 , which was the deadline given .
Italy is one of the countries drawing attention for their positive attitu@@ des when it comes to Turkey .
diplomatic sources say that Rome 's stance is related to the financial package and not towards Turkey , and is related to the problems between Italy , the European Commission and some member countries of the union .
there has been tension between Italy and the EU for a while now .
Ren@@ zi continued to har@@ sh@@ ly cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , and the EU in the latest EU summit on energy , banking and immig@@ ration .
cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ing the attitude of Ren@@ zi in y@@ es@@ ter@@ day 's press conference , J@@ unc@@ ker said that " Ren@@ zi should qu@@ it accus@@ ing the EU . "
" it is wrong of Ren@@ zi , even though I like him very much , to hum@@ ili@@ ate the European Commission on every occas@@ ion . "
J@@ unc@@ ker imp@@ lied that Ren@@ zi plays to internal public opinion .
1 billion of the 3 billion euros , promised to Turkey , will be covered by the EU budget .
2 billion euros will be covered by the bud@@ gets of the member countries .
Germany will contribute at le@@ st 4@@ 27 million euros .
it has been decided that 2.@@ 3 billion euros will be transferred to the EU budget and used to support J@@ or@@ dan and Lebanon by the Greek Cypriot Administration , which declared that it won ' t transfer money to Turkey for political reasons .
the funds are predic@@ ted to be used during the 20@@ 16 @ - @ 20@@ 17 period .
I cri@@ ed when I saw the Char@@ li@@ e H@@ eb@@ do car@@ to@@ on
speaking to the Russian official news agency Sp@@ ut@@ nik , the father Abdullah Kur@@ di reac@@ ted strongly and said , " to tell the truth , I cri@@ ed because of that car@@ to@@ on . "
" I felt very bad . "
stat@@ ing that he expected positive things from the French s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal magazine Char@@ li@@ e H@@ eb@@ do , which has become the symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack , Kur@@ di added the following :
they made a bad car@@ to@@ on unfortunately .
everybody felt very sad about this car@@ to@@ on .
Ay@@ lan is a 2 year old bo@@ y and he died .
Char@@ li@@ e H@@ eb@@ do was sup@@ posed to show respect to Ay@@ lan , to me and my family , but the ex@@ act op@@ pos@@ ite is true .
this magazine should show respect to the dead children .
they published a dis@@ respec@@ t@@ ful car@@ to@@ on about our hon@@ our@@ able Pro@@ p@@ he@@ t .
they even made public@@ ations regarding Al@@ lah .
compared with the public@@ ations on Al@@ lah and our Pro@@ p@@ he@@ t , what they done to my son is a small thing .
Kur@@ di , living in Er@@ bil , made the following appeal : " I call on the whole world and the s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal magaz@@ ines to show respect to all the dead children . "
they should not ad@@ d to the gri@@ ef the families are already suffer@@ ing .
T@@ ima Kur@@ di , an a@@ un@@ t of Ay@@ lan Kur@@ di living in Canada , is also among those to re@@ act to the car@@ to@@ on .
in the car@@ to@@ on by La@@ ur@@ ent " R@@ is@@ s " S@@ our@@ is@@ se@@ au , it is imp@@ lied that 3 year old Syrian Ay@@ lan Kur@@ di , whose dead body came ash@@ ore at B@@ od@@ rum , " may have become one of the se@@ x ab@@ users in Germany when he gro@@ ws up . "
last year , having been ex@@ posed to an attack in which religious ra@@ dic@@ als killed 12 people because of the public@@ ation of car@@ to@@ ons dep@@ ic@@ ting Mu@@ ham@@ ma@@ d , French s@@ ati@@ ri@@ cal magazine Char@@ li@@ e H@@ eb@@ do become the focus of discussions with its car@@ to@@ on of Ay@@ lan Kur@@ di .
in the car@@ to@@ on the mo@@ le@@ st@@ ers , with pi@@ g heads , ev@@ oking immigrants and also ch@@ asing women , who were por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed like the women ab@@ used during the new year celebrations in Germany , especially C@@ olo@@ gn@@ e .
having s@@ tir@@ red up different reactions on social media , the car@@ to@@ on is part of a col@@ umn cons@@ isting of 4 fra@@ mes .
" this is not France " is written on the col@@ umn , and the lost values of France and increasing hos@@ ti@@ li@@ ty against refugees are cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed according to many read@@ ers .
on the other hand , the car@@ to@@ on caused many people to acc@@ use Char@@ li@@ e H@@ eb@@ do of rac@@ ism .
while Char@@ li@@ e H@@ eb@@ do praised Germany , which accepted 800 thous@@ and refugees , it cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed France for its un@@ willing attitude towards opening its doors to refugees in an issue published last year .
it was said in the car@@ to@@ on " the goal was too close " and " two children 's men@@ us for the price of one " was written in the adverti@@ sing pos@@ ter .
" A@@ ut@@ op@@ si@@ es in Germany for the Ger@@ man@@ s who died in Sul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met "
according to information on the website of the weekly magazine D@@ er Sp@@ i@@ e@@ gel , the German F@@ ederal Prosecutor 's Office decided that the bodies of the 10 people who died in the attack , will be brought to Germany .
the bodies of the dead will be brought home today or tom@@ or@@ row on a German Air Forces plan@@ e and will be welcomed by a ceremony at the airport .
experts from the I@@ denti@@ fication Commission of the F@@ ederal Criminal Police Office ( B@@ K@@ A ) , who carry out for@@ en@@ sic operations in Germany , nor@@ m@@ ally travel to the countries where an incident has occurred to conduct the identi@@ fication and aut@@ op@@ sy for German citizens killed in acci@@ dents or attacks .
however , the magazine D@@ er Sp@@ i@@ e@@ gel wrote that things will be done differ@@ ently this time .
according to the magazine , officials from the F@@ ederal Criminal Police Office applied to Turkish authorities to conduct the identi@@ fication and aut@@ op@@ sy operations in Istanbul but the request was refused .
the F@@ ederal Criminal Police Office sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack .
treatment is continuing on seven German tourists who were injured in the attack .

ban@@ ning of mal@@ e refugees from swim@@ ming po@@ ols
in a report in the German press , it was reported that the ban will be lif@@ ted if the volunte@@ er workers from the d@@ or@@ mit@@ ories no@@ ti@@ fy them that the message has been under@@ stood by the refugees .
stat@@ ing in his interview to W@@ D@@ R that the municipality does not want to pun@@ ish in@@ no@@ cent people because of the behavi@@ our of a few people , an official from the social affairs department , Mark@@ us Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ ka , said that those st@@ ay@@ ing in the d@@ or@@ mit@@ ories had been informed in three languages about the important values in Germany .
noting that they will not discuss the value of gender equality important to Germany , Sch@@ n@@ ap@@ ka added that the municipality will pun@@ ish all kin@@ ds of attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
meanwhile , R@@ he@@ in@@ berg has cancel@@ led its annual car@@ ni@@ val because of the possibility of C@@ olo@@ gn@@ e @ - @ st@@ yle attacks oc@@ curr@@ ing during the celebrations .
the municipality declared that the festival par@@ ade was cancel@@ led because there is no guarantee that incidents of har@@ ass@@ ment would not occ@@ ur .
what are the benefits of ste@@ am co@@ oking ?
a tech@@ ni@@ que that does not k@@ ill v@@ it@@ am@@ ins and min@@ er@@ als in food , ste@@ am co@@ oking is becoming increasingly popular .
ste@@ am co@@ oking , one of the most pre@@ ferred co@@ oking meth@@ ods in the F@@ ar @ - @ East for centuries , strength@@ ens the met@@ abol@@ ism and makes di@@ ges@@ tion easier .
bac@@ ter@@ ia and ger@@ ms in food are completely er@@ adi@@ cated with this meth@@ od , which also elimin@@ ates problems such as dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ si@@ a .
substan@@ ces found in fo@@ ods such as prote@@ in , cel@@ lul@@ ose and star@@ ch completely dis@@ ol@@ ve using this tech@@ ni@@ que , making the food sof@@ ter .
taking place in low pressure , ste@@ am co@@ oking is done in a co@@ oking po@@ t with the help of ste@@ am pot@@ s or ste@@ am mach@@ ines .
both the amount of water used and the co@@ oking time is less when co@@ oking at high pressure .
the best example of this is co@@ oking in a pressure co@@ ok@@ er .
especially for co@@ oking di@@ etary fo@@ ods such as ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les , it is necessary to was@@ h the ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les well first , and then it is necessary to put them into a stra@@ in@@ er and wait for the water to stra@@ in .
one @ - @ third of a deep co@@ oking po@@ t is fil@@ led with water and a ste@@ am stra@@ in@@ er is placed inside the po@@ t .
the m@@ outh of the co@@ oking po@@ t is half closed .
in this way , we allow ste@@ am to es@@ cape from the co@@ oking po@@ t .
fir@@ st@@ ly the he@@ at of the ov@@ en is set to the highest degree and the water is bo@@ iled ; after the temper@@ ature is fixed by setting the he@@ at in the ov@@ en to a lower degree .
the ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les and food are ste@@ am co@@ oked for 10 @ - @ 15 minutes and are then chec@@ ked with the help of a for@@ k once they are co@@ oked .
the co@@ oked ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les are removed from the ov@@ en and served on pla@@ tes .
appearance , col@@ our and ar@@ om@@ a of the food do not change with the ste@@ am co@@ oking tech@@ ni@@ que ; therefore this is a health@@ y meth@@ od .
the dist@@ inc@@ tive tas@@ te of the food st@@ ays the same .
therefore the quality and f@@ lav@@ our of the food are not sp@@ o@@ iled .
loss of n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion is kept to a minimum in ste@@ am co@@ oking , which is also the most econom@@ ical way of co@@ oking .
Ste@@ a@@ med ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les offer a satis@@ factory f@@ lav@@ our for the din@@ er with their fresh and vi@@ br@@ ant appearance .
frequ@@ ently used , especially as part of a di@@ et , this meth@@ od is often pre@@ ferred also because it is very light .
David Bo@@ wi@@ e - Bla@@ ck@@ star : the ali@@ en 's " last al@@ bu@@ m "
kno@@ wing that you will di@@ e ; produc@@ ing that final al@@ bu@@ m without telling anyone ; making your de@@ ath@@ bed an arti@@ sti@@ c expression in the music video you shot ...
these kin@@ ds of actions may seem " extre@@ me " to us m@@ ort@@ al earth@@ lings .
I say m@@ ort@@ al earth@@ lings because I am among those who believe that the man who did this is both Im@@ m@@ ort@@ al and ali@@ en .
he came to our world from some cor@@ ner of the uni@@ ver@@ se ; now he has returned to his mo@@ ther@@ land ; which is just how it goes .
he came because it was necessary to in@@ sp@@ ire not only K@@ is@@ s , Mar@@ il@@ y@@ n M@@ ans@@ on or L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a , but also all the sin@@ gers of the world .
he fulfilled his duty with success .
David Bo@@ wi@@ e , Bla@@ ck@@ star , i@@ T@@ un@@ es price : 9.@@ 99 T@@ L 5 / 5
may@@ be he was no@@ ur@@ ished by W@@ ar@@ hol and K@@ ub@@ ri@@ ck from the same plan@@ et as him .
when A@@ pol@@ lo 11 lan@@ ded on ear@@ th , he decided to say " this is nothing , I am an ali@@ en , " and he joined us by sing@@ ing " Sp@@ ace Od@@ di@@ ty . "
actually he did not join us ; he was always ahead of us .
thanks to him , many people found their way .
both mu@@ sicians and l@@ isten@@ ers ...
if we leave aside his interest in plas@@ tic ar@@ ts , his acting et@@ c . , it would be wrong to say that his music was " just music . "
the charac@@ ters he created by himself , travel@@ ling from song to song , his refer@@ ences , innov@@ ation , tab@@ o@@ o @ - @ breaking behavi@@ our and dis@@ co@@ graphy reflect an arti@@ sti@@ c integrity for me .
I can re@@ member him neither as the father of g@@ lam rock , nor as the co@@ us@@ in of pun@@ k ...
if I re@@ member him like that , what will happen to his av@@ ant @ - @ gar@@ de and electronic works , and to jazz , which he kept as an internal love since his ch@@ ild@@ hood ?
David Bo@@ wi@@ e always remin@@ ded us what the expression " ic@@ on " means , up until that time when the word spread like w@@ ild@@ fire .
he was not a man ; he was not a woman ; he was not " human . "
he was a body .
it se@@ e@@ med to us that he was on a mission .
that body left this world two days after the release of his 26th stu@@ di@@ o al@@ bu@@ m " Bla@@ ck@@ star . "
he tried to prepare us for the fact that he would leave with " Bla@@ ck@@ star " and " Lazar@@ us , " which we had l@@ ist@@ ened to before the release of the al@@ bu@@ m .
we thought that " he has g@@ ot@@ ten old now , so he talks about death , " but he was aware of everything .
one more final hand ...
we can say that there are four son@@ gs that we already k@@ new when the al@@ bu@@ m was released ; " Bla@@ ck@@ star " and " Lazar@@ us , " sho@@ ul@@ dering the burden of message and em@@ o@@ tion , " S@@ ue ( O@@ r I@@ n A Se@@ ason O@@ f Cri@@ me ) " and " T@@ is A p@@ ity S@@ he W@@ as A Wh@@ ore , " previously released but re @ - @ recorded for this al@@ bu@@ m .
I would ad@@ d that the remaining son@@ gs , " G@@ ir@@ l L@@ ov@@ es M@@ e , " " I C@@ an ' t Gi@@ ve E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing A@@ way " and " D@@ ol@@ lar D@@ ays , " are also very good .
when we look at " Bla@@ ck@@ star " as a whole , it was created on a very strong mu@@ sical structure , but it fe@@ els like it was produced with s@@ inc@@ ere and in@@ stan@@ tan@@ e@@ ous feel@@ ings as well .
it is an al@@ bu@@ m neither of death nor a " rec@@ kon@@ ing with the past ... "
it is just a real " final " al@@ bu@@ m .
" the En@@ d " cap@@ tion of a life in music , which is a mas@@ ter@@ pi@@ ece in its enti@@ re@@ ty .

upon speculation that " the price of bre@@ ad would increase " before the new year , especially in December , Far@@ uk Ç@@ elik , minister of food , agriculture and li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and B@@ ül@@ ent T@@ üf@@ ek@@ çi , minister of customs and trade stated that " there would be no price increase . "
however , 25@@ 0@@ g of bre@@ ad was selling for 1 T@@ L y@@ es@@ ter@@ day in the capital , Ankara .
the head of the Turkish Bak@@ ers ' Federation , Hal@@ il İbrahim Bal@@ cı stated that , regarding the 25 kur@@ uş price increase on bre@@ ad , " N@@ o price increase was imposed , the price list of 2 years ago began to be applied " and added :
" it was a price decision taken 2 years ago . "
the Chamber of mer@@ chan@@ ts ' union decided on this price 2 years ago .
it is a price implemented throughout Turkey .
in other words , there was no application and implementation of a price increase .
however some bak@@ er@@ ies sold bre@@ ad for 75 kur@@ uş in some regions of Ankara due to competition .
in other regions , it was already being sold for 1 T@@ L .
bak@@ ers , confident about the quality of their bre@@ ad , did not decrease their prices . they have to implement 1 T@@ L due to competition .
there is no price increase .
they are implementing the price that had not been implemented before .
" the price of bre@@ ad per kilo certainly won ' t exce@@ ed 5 T@@ L in the first half of 20@@ 16 , and we will end this year with this price if we do not experience any major problems . "
in some areas of Istanbul , bre@@ ad started to be sold for 1.@@ 25 T@@ L .
blo@@ ody terror attack this time in Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o
23 people from 18 different countries were killed in the attack which targeted a lu@@ x@@ ury hotel known to be pre@@ ferred by foreigners and officials from the United N@@ ations in the West Afri@@ can country Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o .
al Qaeda 's North Africa branch claimed responsibility for the attack .
the attack in Bur@@ k@@ ina F@@ as@@ o occurred four days after the terrorist attack by Is@@ is on Jak@@ ar@@ ta , the capital of In@@ don@@ es@@ ia , which is the most crow@@ ded Muslim country in the world with a population of 250 million .
one Can@@ adi@@ an and one In@@ don@@ es@@ ian were killed in the gun and bomb attacks that were carried out during the day@@ time at a branch of Star@@ bu@@ cks and a police bo@@ x on a b@@ us@@ y street con@@ taining foreign em@@ bas@@ si@@ es , lu@@ x@@ ur@@ ious hotels and shops .
In@@ don@@ es@@ ian officials explained that the att@@ ack@@ ers were in@@ sp@@ ired by the Paris massacre on November 13 .
a security correspondent from English television channel the BBC , Frank gar@@ ner , pointed out that this attack was a part of a fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing ten@@ den@@ cy man@@ i@@ fes@@ ting itself recently in different cities around the world .
the U@@ . S@@ . was also hur@@ t by terrorist actions a short time ago .
14 people were killed in an armed attack carried out by a couple sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic to I@@ sil in S@@ an Ber@@ n@@ adin@@ o , C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia in the U@@ . S@@ . at the beginning of last December .
the " S@@ an Ber@@ n@@ ard@@ ino " attack hor@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the U@@ . S@@ .
after the suic@@ ide bomb@@ ing attack on Sul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met that killed 10 German tourists , T@@ ho@@ mas de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ere , the German Minister of Inter@@ nal Affairs , remin@@ ded us that there are many terrorist attacks oc@@ curr@@ ing in many places around the world , and added , " We have experienced two big attacks in Paris . "
if we say this , then terror will win ...
we used the expression " standing firm . "
I@@ sil have stopped using W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p , and now use the Al@@ ra@@ w@@ i application
according to a new report , the terrorist organiz@@ ation I@@ sil is benef@@ iting from its own ch@@ at to@@ ol for communic@@ ating without having to depend on applic@@ ations such as W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p and tele@@ gra@@ m .
according to the report from Def@@ en@@ se O@@ ne , the organiz@@ ation is benef@@ iting from a new mes@@ sa@@ ging application for mes@@ sa@@ ging inside the organiz@@ ation .
named " Al@@ ra@@ w@@ i , " this An@@ dro@@ id application is distribu@@ ted and instal@@ led via an A@@ P@@ K f@@ ile .
the application allows the organiz@@ ation to cip@@ her messages and share media among themselves .
a sur@@ prising move from I@@ sil in Iraq
according to gh@@ ost Security Group , func@@ tion@@ ality of the application is " pri@@ m@@ iti@@ ve " in compar@@ ison with such popular applic@@ ations as W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p and tele@@ gra@@ m .
for now , it is not known how strong the ci@@ ph@@ ering used is .
before this , I@@ sil carried out all of its communication via tele@@ gra@@ m , an application allowing messages to be sent on en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ted connections .
however , tele@@ gra@@ m revealed all the chan@@ n@@ els in which the I@@ sil members were ch@@ at@@ ting .
in addition to this , the U@@ . S@@ . government has requested that application develop@@ ers put back @ - @ doors in their applic@@ ations .
for this reason , the organiz@@ ation has now started to use its own solutions rather than re@@ lying on the ci@@ ph@@ ering of W@@ hat@@ s@@ ap@@ p and tele@@ gra@@ m .

how to use the mid @ - @ term break ?
how should students use the mid @ - @ term break ? - we asked this question to educational speci@@ alist and student coach , Mur@@ at Ay@@ d@@ ın .
students should not only think of mid @ - @ term break as spending time rest@@ ing , enter@@ taining and wat@@ ching television .
mid @ - @ term break is an important opportunity to get ready for the new school term and to review last term .
being free time , the mid @ - @ term break is also a good opportunity for person@@ ality development , acqu@@ is@@ ition of knowledge and skills , and taking up a new ho@@ b@@ by .
make a list of what to do during the term .
wr@@ ite down everything you plan to do , and try to put it into practice .
you can be sure that you will benefit from this and have a more efficient term .
now , fir@@ st@@ ly , let 's talk about how efficient the term should be for students preparing for the Y@@ G@@ S @ - @ L@@ Y@@ S ex@@ ams .
because the most common questions coming from the students preparing for Y@@ G@@ S @ - @ L@@ Y@@ S are as follows : " how should we use this time , should we solve a lot of questions or finish in@@ complete sub@@ j@@ ects ? "
fir@@ st@@ ly , lets introduce our article with both the ans@@ wers to these questions and some ad@@ vice to those who are preparing for the ex@@ am in order to spend the time effici@@ ently .
while the preparation period for the ex@@ ams should be a process that star@@ ts from the 9th gra@@ de , under normal conditions , we are trying instead to complete it in the final 1 year ; this obli@@ ges us to spend our last year more effectively , by using our time more effici@@ ently and proper@@ ly .
a final gra@@ de student must deal with both the ex@@ am preparation and preparation for school written ex@@ ams at the same time .
even if the gradu@@ ate students have finished school and experienced the ex@@ am ( Y@@ G@@ S @ - @ L@@ Y@@ S ) at least once , the year they prepare for the ex@@ am again as a gradu@@ ate student is critic@@ ally important for them as well .
because most gradu@@ ate students and their families see " that " year as a last chance , which cre@@ ates greater st@@ ress .
re@@ vision is the study that students do not like ; they do it because they feel obli@@ ged to do it ; and therefore they always post@@ p@@ one it to the last moment ; but it becomes completely a duty for the students that do it regular@@ ly and make it a ha@@ bit ; and there is always a plan for what and when things need to be done .
now we have a mid @ - @ term break ahead of us and we have to use it in the best way possible .
to do this , we should always have a plan that allows us to manage our time well .
stu@@ d@@ ying for L@@ ess@@ ons during mid @ - @ term break :
fir@@ st@@ ly , everyone should make a plan su@@ itable to their situation .
1 . they should include what they have covered , what are the in@@ complete sub@@ j@@ ects in their plan and they should plan their days , weeks and 15 @ - @ day peri@@ ods .
there should be both les@@ son re@@ vision and question sol@@ ving in this period .
in the mean@@ time , students that do not have any in@@ complete sub@@ j@@ ects can solve 1 or 2 mo@@ ck ex@@ ams on average .
deal with Y@@ our In@@ complete sub@@ j@@ ects : Studies show that people for@@ get 75 per@@ cent of what they learn in a week , 66 per@@ cent in a day , and 54 per@@ cent in an hour .
the best and most effective meth@@ od of elimin@@ ating this ten@@ den@@ cy to for@@ get is by doing re@@ vision .
especially students who make too many er@@ r@@ ors in prior les@@ sons should conc@@ entr@@ ate on stu@@ d@@ ying with general re@@ vision .
fir@@ st@@ ly , determine what are the in@@ complete sub@@ j@@ ects and make your plan every@@ day ; choose one les@@ son every@@ day and completely deal with it .
this planning will help you in both academ@@ ic and psych@@ ological situ@@ ations .
when adding sub@@ j@@ ects to your plan , pay attention to the sub@@ j@@ ects you make the most er@@ r@@ ors in .
because there will be no long holiday peri@@ ods in the future .
solve Qu@@ es@@ tions :
question sol@@ ving is as important as re@@ vis@@ ing les@@ sons .
because we can see how much we understand the sub@@ j@@ ects we study only through the fe@@ ed@@ back from the questions we solve .
do not for@@ get to selec@@ t a number of questions to be solved each day .
the number of questions you solve may change in line with what you study ; you may not solve many questions on a day that you mostly study les@@ sons , but we should still solve questions to a certain ex@@ tent , at least in order to see how much we lear@@ ned from the les@@ son of that day .
solve Mo@@ ck ex@@ ams :
another area of study to look into during mid @ - @ term break should be sol@@ ving mo@@ ck ex@@ ams .
even if all the sub@@ j@@ ects are not finished , you can solve mo@@ ck ex@@ ams at least for each les@@ son .
S@@ up@@ posing that you finished a Turkish les@@ son , you can solve a 40 @ - @ question mo@@ ck ex@@ am of Turkish .
you should defin@@ itely keep track of time while doing this .
if you solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes , your next target should be to complete it several minutes fas@@ ter .
vac@@ ation and ho@@ b@@ by Plan@@ s :
of course , a break does not only mean stu@@ d@@ ying for les@@ sons , you should spar@@ e a few days for vac@@ ation , to rest and spend time on your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es .
a holiday period spent only stu@@ d@@ ying for les@@ sons will stop you from having f@@ un and rela@@ x@@ ing .
for this reason , there should be special time set aside for yo@@ ur@@ self .
reading books , wat@@ ching television or sur@@ f@@ ing the internet may be in your plans , but the most important thing is how much time you spar@@ e for each activity .
I have some ad@@ vice for those who say that I could not spend the first term effici@@ ently .
if you can say that I could not spend the first term well , I could not study much and I mis@@ sed many les@@ sons , this mid @ - @ term break is a big opportunity for you as well .
nevertheless , you should fir@@ st@@ ly decide on and believe this .
most of the goals in the 2009 @ - @ 2010 Turkish Su@@ per League were scored between minutes 76 and 90 .
now , answer the question you ask ; do you go to the loc@@ ker room after the end of the match or is the match still continuing and is there enough time for you to score a goal ?
I sup@@ pose that no one wants to say , " we will look forward to our next match , " a conven@@ tional expression used by the coach or players of a losing football team .
now , the only thing you should do is look forward and let go of the past , and run instead of w@@ alk@@ ing .
to sum@@ mar@@ ize what we said :
1 ) Fir@@ st@@ ly make a mid @ - @ term break plan ,
2 ) re@@ vis@@ e the les@@ sons you know ,
3 ) Fin@@ ish any in@@ complete sub@@ j@@ ects ,
4 ) consolid@@ ate what you have lear@@ ned by sol@@ ving questions ,
5 ) Sol@@ ve mo@@ ck ex@@ ams ,
6 ) Re@@ ad books ,
7 ) determine new goals for next term ,
8 ) S@@ par@@ e time for you , your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es and the things you enjoy ,
9 ) S@@ par@@ e time for your family and your friends ,
10 ) S@@ par@@ e time for social and cultural activities ( cin@@ ema , s@@ port , theatre , concert , travel , pic@@ n@@ ics , et@@ c . )

we would have lik@@ ed people to dance and sing fol@@ k son@@ gs here .
however , where we stand now is under@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
the reality is that Turkey could not be govern@@ ed .
the resul@@ ting atmosphere over@@ sha@@ do@@ ws all of that .
the cause of the p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ m is those who are governing the country .
as a member of CHP , we are against terror no matter where it comes from .
terror is a crime against humanity and the terrorists should not be for@@ given .
the fight against terrorism is carried out with intelligence , knowledge and compre@@ hen@@ sion .
we certainly want to fight against it , and we want everybody to be un@@ tou@@ ched .
what is the difference between the photo@@ graph@@ s from the Southeast and the photo@@ graph@@ s from Syria and Lebanon ?
when they came to the table , they made serious mist@@ akes .
the government is responsible for all the blo@@ od@@ sh@@ ed , te@@ ars and victims .
they took over this country with zer@@ o terrorism in 2002 , but today Turkey has turned into a blo@@ od@@ b@@ ath .
who is responsible for them ?
the tax@@ i dri@@ ver Ş@@ eh@@ muz in Diyarbak@@ ır ?
for what does Turkey pay the price ?
we will participate gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely in the meetings to change the coup d ' et@@ at laws , we will offer our opinions .
we won ' t let any@@ body build a country on their personal views .
I say , " L@@ et 's change the pro @ - @ coup min@@ d@@ set . "
the houses of this country 's intellectu@@ als are rai@@ ded and they are taken into custody because they gave their opinion .
there are parts of what they say we do not agree with , but people should be able to offer their opinions fre@@ ely .
this tin@@ po@@ t dic@@ t@@ ator says , " Th@@ ose who benefit from the state , tre@@ at it as an en@@ em@@ y . "
I would also like to ask him ; those who benefit from the state , and use all the opportunities of the state , why don ' t they think about it when they ro@@ b the country ?
CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country .
we will make preparations together for the fourth biggest revol@@ ution .
we will defin@@ itely bring liber@@ tar@@ ian democracy to this country no matter what it costs .
they may de@@ tain us , they may take us into custody ; CHP will bring freedom to this country no matter what they do , no matter how heavy the price .
I 'm making a clear , stra@@ ight call to you , Davutoğlu .
do not hi@@ de behind the coup d ' et@@ at laws , those who hi@@ de behind them do not ban@@ ish from one 's mind the coup mental@@ ity .
you gave a mer@@ it@@ or@@ ious service medal to someone who gave a warning to you .
which coup are you talking about ?
it is completely aimed at de@@ ce@@ i@@ ving the people .
party officials listed the other 3 revol@@ utions as follows : the 1st big revol@@ ution is the foundation of the Republic by putting an end to the sul@@ tan@@ ate ; the 2nd big revol@@ ution is the passing from the single party era to the multi @ - @ party era in the time of İn@@ ön@@ ü ; the 3rd big revol@@ ution is passing into social democracy with B@@ ül@@ ent E@@ cev@@ it ...
there are qual@@ ific@@ ations and duties of the President .
there is a President 's o@@ ath in article 1@@ 03 .
we know how important the concep@@ ts of hon@@ es@@ ty and honour are in this society .
if someone comes out and gives this promise , they should keep their word to the death .
because hon@@ es@@ ty and honour are in@@ disp@@ ut@@ able for us .
what do hon@@ es@@ ty and honour mean for you , tin@@ po@@ t dic@@ t@@ ator ?
what do you understand from hon@@ es@@ ty and honour , why did you take this o@@ ath ?
what do hon@@ es@@ ty and honour mean to you ?
I want to learn this .
the concep@@ ts of hon@@ es@@ ty and honour are held in high es@@ te@@ em by religious people .
their intention is not to abol@@ ish the law of the coup , but to for@@ ti@@ fy the law of the coup .
it does not su@@ ffic@@ e and they want the presidential system .
what kind of presidency ; it is a presidential system with a bos@@ s .
why do you rej@@ ect the Ottoman parliamentary system ?
one person comman@@ ds and everybody does what is necessary .
do we have a health@@ y parliament in Turkey that works ?
no , it does not work .
if we bring liber@@ tar@@ ian democracy , the system will work .
they repeatedly say coup but they are strengthening the law of the coup .
declar@@ ing his nomin@@ ation for candidacy of the general presidency , İz@@ mir Deputy Mustafa Bal@@ b@@ ay could not join the race because he could not gather the sign@@ atures of 1@@ 28 deleg@@ ates necessary for the candidacy .
gather@@ ing 92 sign@@ atures , Bal@@ b@@ ay said , " I am not able to become a candidate under present conditions . "
the thing that attracted attention was that the previous CHP leader Deniz Bay@@ kal sat in the tri@@ bun@@ es with party members instead of the seats allocated to deputies and members of the party council ( PM ) , the central executive board ( M@@ Y@@ K ) and hon@@ or@@ ary board .
Istanbul deputy Gü@@ lay Y@@ ede@@ k@@ çi arrived early and sat near the section allocated to the General President K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu instead of s@@ it@@ ting in the area allocated to the deputies .
one of the things most spok@@ en about in the back@@ stage of the con@@ gress was the con@@ vers@@ ation between K@@ l@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu and the Y@@ al@@ ova deputy Mu@@ har@@ re@@ m İn@@ ce .
İn@@ ce explained that membership of the party council was offered to him , but he did not accept it .
however , sources from central office claim that the meeting request came from İn@@ ce and membership of the party council was not offered to him .
In@@ ce shared a message on T@@ wit@@ ter , " N@@ o matter who they are , the sources from the central office can get the details of the con@@ vers@@ ation from the Istanbul deputy Ali Öz@@ can . "
Öz@@ can said , " Ho@@ w can I know about the con@@ vers@@ ation between two people . "
he only said , " he went and spoke with him . "
K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu 's son ap@@ pla@@ u@@ ded his " father " repeatedly .
the back@@ stage of the party council left its mark on the first day of the ordinary " Congress of Democracy , Chan@@ ge and Bro@@ ther@@ hood . "
after his speech at the con@@ gress , K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu went to his home and started to work on the list of party council .
it was under@@ stood that while preparing the key list of 100 people , he called the 13 central executive board ( M@@ Y@@ K ) members and said he would include them in the list ; except for the current central executive board members Yak@@ up Ak@@ kaya , Sen@@ cer A@@ yat@@ a and Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ aş , who declared that they did not want to be on the executive and did not apply for the party council ( PM ) , and Sey@@ han Er@@ doğ@@ du , who applied once more to the party council .
it is stated that K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu may ref@@ er to another nar@@ row list in addition to the 100 person @ - @ key list of the party council .
in the 21 article @ - @ final declaration , accepted unanim@@ ously at the CHP con@@ gress , the abol@@ is@@ hment of the ann@@ ot@@ ation on the European Charter of Lo@@ cal Sel@@ f @ - @ Government was requested , which was brought into the agenda with the self government discussions of D@@ TK , and the increase of the authority share in the local affairs .
In@@ cle@@ ded in the declaration were the aims of " ending of the party state system " and " establishment of a transparent and accoun@@ table rule of law . "
Vice Chairman of the AK Party S@@ elç@@ uk Öz@@ da@@ ğ , İ@@ dri@@ s Bal@@ uk@@ en from H@@ DP and Ru@@ h@@ sa@@ r Dem@@ i@@ rel from M@@ HP wat@@ ched the con@@ gress .
AK Party member Öz@@ da@@ ğ and the delegation from the AK Party left the h@@ all when K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu har@@ sh@@ ly cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed President Erdoğan .
Öz@@ da@@ ğ said , " I saw that he kno@@ ws no boun@@ dar@@ ies of cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ing , it was not possible for me to accept it . "
the ban@@ ner with ph@@ otos of the arrested journalists C@@ an Dün@@ dar and Er@@ dem Gül and the text " I@@ f I don ' t bur@@ n , if you don ' t bur@@ n , if we don ' t bur@@ n , how will the light van@@ qu@@ ish the d@@ ark@@ ness ? , " and the ban@@ ner of " Peace " in English , Turkish and Kurdish attracted attention in the h@@ all .
the con@@ gress started in the morning with the son@@ gs of Group Y@@ orum and Ahmet K@@ aya .
there was big ap@@ pla@@ use for the message sent by Türk@@ an El@@ çi , wife of the B@@ ar president of Diyarbak@@ ır Ta@@ hir El@@ çi , who was killed in an armed assa@@ ult .
Ber@@ kin El@@ van 's mother G@@ ül@@ sü@@ m and father Sam@@ i El@@ van also participated in the con@@ gress .
the most ap@@ pla@@ u@@ ded part of the speech was the part in which K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu said that they will em@@ br@@ ace democracy " to the death " no matter what price they have to pay .
having as@@ sem@@ b@@ led 34 ordinary and 18 extra@@ ordinary con@@ gres@@ ses , 52 con@@ gres@@ ses in total until now , CHP as@@ sem@@ b@@ led the 5@@ 3rd big con@@ gress in Ankara Ar@@ ena y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
participation was high .
there were more than 15 thous@@ and CHP members in the h@@ all with a capacity of 12 thous@@ and seats .
however , the crowd didn ' t do justice to this number with their en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m .
the most ex@@ citing moment was the moment in which K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu entered the h@@ all with his wife Sel@@ v@@ i K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu .
the ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment continued when the K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu couple gre@@ e@@ ted the h@@ all with a wave .
there is no tr@@ ace of the discipl@@ ine seen in the con@@ gres@@ ses of the AK Party .
there was a lot of movement in the ground area of the ar@@ ena even when K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu was making speech .
it was obvi@@ ous that the CHP members , w@@ an@@ ting to enter the Party Council , pre@@ ferred to seek support by talking about themselves to party execu@@ tives and journalists .
one of the CHP execu@@ tives tried to expla@@ in that this situation was not a bad thing by saying , " I@@ t is better than s@@ it@@ ting down without moving and lining up the wal@@ k @ - @ on party members as in the party meetings of Ko@@ rea or the Soviet Union . "
the CHP con@@ gress has one more difference from the con@@ gres@@ ses of the AK Party or M@@ HP .
in these parties , only the general president talks .
in CHP , the con@@ gress becomes a platform in which the problems of the party are discussed .
when the number of party members w@@ an@@ ting to speak increased , Council Chairman Mur@@ at Kar@@ ay@@ al@@ ç@@ ın had difficul@@ ty in adj@@ ust@@ ing the time .
there was the expression " The home@@ land goes bad " in their faces , and there was a dist@@ ance to the comments " Y@@ ou will then change this course of events with the result coming from this h@@ all . "
all the CHP members said , " So@@ me@@ thing should be done , " but there was@@ n ' t a strong and co@@ her@@ ent answer to the question of " Wh@@ at should be done . "
the fact that there will be no election in the next 4 years had a big effect on the situation .
when K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu went up to the ros@@ tru@@ m , we journalists w@@ ai@@ ted for his answer to the question " Wh@@ at should be done . "
fir@@ st@@ ly , K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu ans@@ w@@ ered the question " what is going on . "
he highlighted the issue of the arrested journalists , what was done to academ@@ ics because of the declaration , what took place in the southeast , the dead@@ lock that foreign policy has come to .
he repeatedly ans@@ w@@ ered the " legen@@ ds of Anatol@@ ia " issue related to his CHP party , such as , " it is a party of non @ - @ beli@@ ever@@ s , " " it supports cou@@ ps d ' é@@ t@@ at " and " it is the party of eli@@ ti@@ sts . "
when it comes to the " Wh@@ at should be done " stage , he tried to put forward a " strategy " rather than discussing concrete steps .
he stressed that all of these problems could be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice .
he gave a promise on behalf of CHP and said , " We will work no matter what it costs until we bring democracy . "
" we will struggle to the death for democracy . "
one last note : it is necessary to re@@ member that CHP have solved the issue of " organiz@@ ation " as of the 5@@ 3rd con@@ gress , and it now succe@@ eds in as@@ sem@@ b@@ ling a con@@ gress without problem .
on another note , cards were prin@@ ted for 900 journalists said to be attending the con@@ gress , but journalist participation in the h@@ all was not at that level .
representatives of media organiz@@ ations from Ankara were not as e@@ ager as they were for the con@@ gres@@ ses of the AK Party .
life sentence was demanded for autonomy
the indictment , prepared by the Chief Public Prosecutor 's Office against 7 suspects , 3 of whom are in detention , was accepted by the 4th High Criminal Court .
in the indictment , it was stated that declar@@ ations under the name of " autonomy " were made in some distri@@ c@@ ts and neighbour@@ ho@@ ods of Diyarbak@@ ır , İstanbul , Ş@@ ır@@ nak , Mar@@ din , Mu@@ ş , Hak@@ kar@@ i , Si@@ ir@@ t , Bit@@ lis , Bat@@ man , Van and Ağ@@ r@@ ı upon the direc@@ tions and calls by senior execu@@ tives of the terrorist organiz@@ ation PKK / K@@ C@@ K .
indic@@ ating that there were calls for illegal actions by the r@@ ing@@ leaders and the youth and woman for@@ ma@@ tions of the organiz@@ ation , the indictment noted that there was an increase in the actions of bomb@@ ing , long bar@@ re@@ l@@ led weap@@ on and ro@@ c@@ ket laun@@ cher attacks on the security forces , public institutions and organiz@@ ations and people 's houses , work@@ places and vehicles in the S@@ ur , Bağ@@ lar , Sil@@ van , Bis@@ m@@ il , L@@ ice , Dic@@ le and Haz@@ ro distri@@ c@@ ts of Diyarbak@@ ır .
Is@@ is clas@@ hed with opponents ; our police station was hit
the clashes recently seen between Is@@ is and the Army of Con@@ qu@@ est , formed by a group of re@@ bel mil@@ iti@@ as , are becoming violent and continue in the Syrian villages of Du@@ di@@ yan , Q@@ ar@@ ah M@@ az@@ r ' ah , Bag@@ hi@@ din and Q@@ ar@@ ah K@@ ub@@ ri on the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the Y@@ av@@ uz@@ lu village of Kil@@ is .
during the clashes between Is@@ is and its opponents close to the border , gun@@ fire and the no@@ ise of mor@@ tar@@ s can also be heard in Turkey .
coming from the region in which explos@@ ions occ@@ ur frequ@@ ently , sm@@ oke could be seen from Turkey with the nak@@ ed eye , and security forces took conc@@ ent@@ rated prec@@ au@@ tions with ar@@ m@@ oured cars on the border .
on the other hand , har@@ ass@@ ment fire was opened from the Bag@@ hi@@ din village under the control of Is@@ is milit@@ ants at the Mart@@ y@@ r Mehmet Police St@@ ation on the border near the Y@@ av@@ uz@@ lu Vil@@ la@@ ge in Kil@@ is .
then , soldiers responded to the area from which the har@@ ass@@ ment fire was coming , with ho@@ wit@@ zer and heavy gun@@ s within the rules of engagement .
according to claims , Russian war@@ plan@@ es organiz@@ ed an attack on the village of Ha@@ mey@@ in , which is 17 kil@@ o@@ metres from the Turkish border .
wo@@ unded by the a@@ erial bomb@@ ing , 6 Syri@@ ans were brought to the state hospital of Kil@@ is by relatives .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new i@@ Ph@@ one operating system , as Ap@@ ple up@@ date is released
the new operating system can be requested by head@@ ing to the sett@@ ings ap@@ p , t@@ app@@ ing " General , " and then selec@@ ting " Sof@@ tware up@@ date . "
if it 's ready , the phone will give you the option to down@@ lo@@ ad and then in@@ st@@ all it .
some have run into problems after that instal@@ lation , being hit by an er@@ ror message telling them that " Sof@@ tware up@@ date failed . "
to get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the r@@ ush to di@@ e down , or to try and upgrade through i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
the phone itself will gu@@ ide you through the rest of the process .
that might include de@@ le@@ ting Ap@@ ps to make space - but Ap@@ ple has made that less likely by s@@ lim@@ ming down the up@@ date , and also easier to do using a special to@@ ol that will suggest Ap@@ ps to de@@ le@@ te and then re @ - @ in@@ st@@ all them once the process is over .
it 's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the up@@ date happen@@ s , so that it doesn ' t run out of bat@@ tery .
if the charge is too low , Ap@@ ple won ' t let the up@@ date go ahead , since the phone d@@ ying hal@@ f@@ way through could lead to the up@@ date breaking .

F@@ ed@@ E@@ x ear@@ nings mixed , low@@ ers fiscal 20@@ 16 outlook
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x reported dis@@ appoin@@ ting results for its latest quarter , and the deli@@ very giant cut its full @ - @ year profit forec@@ ast on we@@ aker demand for fre@@ ight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to h@@ ire about 5@@ 5,000 se@@ as@@ onal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x announced it would h@@ ire 50,000 se@@ as@@ onal workers for the holidays .
its shares fell about 2.5 per@@ cent in pre@@ market tra@@ ding 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday 's opening bel@@ l .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to ear@@ n between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 c@@ ents from an earlier pre@@ di@@ ction .
analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ S@@ et .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hi@@ kes aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 per@@ cent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground ship@@ ment of heavy or large pack@@ ages , which begin in November .
the company said it still expects ear@@ nings to grow over the previous year because of cost @ - @ c@@ utting , higher revenue and growth in online commer@@ ce .
chairman and CEO F@@ red S@@ mit@@ h said the company was " perfor@@ ming solid@@ ly given we@@ aker @ - @ than @ - @ expected economic conditions , especially in manufac@@ turing and global trade . "
the holiday @ - @ h@@ iring plans were announced a day after rival U@@ PS said that that it plans to h@@ ire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 ex@@ tra workers , about the same that it hi@@ red last year .
in the quarter that ended Aug@@ . 31 , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x ear@@ ned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 per@@ cent from a year earlier .
ear@@ nings per share amoun@@ ted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forec@@ ast of 12 analysts survey@@ ed by Z@@ ac@@ ks Investment Research .
revenue rose 5 per@@ cent , to $ 12@@ .@@ 3 billion .
six analysts survey@@ ed by Z@@ ac@@ ks expected $ 12@@ .@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shi@@ pping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to st@@ ag@@ n@@ ate .
but the bo@@ om in online shop@@ ping has boos@@ ted results at F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Gro@@ und .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 per@@ cent but operating income was bas@@ ically fla@@ t on higher costs for larger pack@@ ages and self @ - @ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the fre@@ ight business on higher la@@ b@@ or costs .
in pre@@ market tra@@ ding about an hour before the opening bel@@ l , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 per@@ cent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
they closed Tuesday down 11 per@@ cent for the year and 17 per@@ cent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticip@@ ated meeting in years , F@@ ederal Res@@ er@@ ve polic@@ y@@ makers will spend two days this week se@@ ated around a 27 @ - @ fo@@ ot H@@ on@@ dur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ g@@ any table deci@@ ding if it 's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at one end of the central bank 's or@@ n@@ ate , two @ - @ story bo@@ ard@@ room will be a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a remin@@ der that F@@ ed Cha@@ ir@@ woman Jan@@ et L@@ . Y@@ el@@ len and her colleagues are sup@@ posed to put the nation 's economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a du@@ al charge from Congress : max@@ imize U@@ . S@@ . employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the Great recession , F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there 's an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the X @ - @ factor in a too @ - @ close @ - @ to @ - @ pre@@ dict decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U@@ . S@@ . economy is ready to start being we@@ an@@ ed from the unprecedented sti@@ mul@@ us provided by the near @ - @ zer@@ o short @ - @ term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing solid@@ ly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could make already @ - @ ca@@ uti@@ ous F@@ ed officials s@@ kit@@ tish about adding to the v@@ ola@@ ti@@ li@@ ty by raising their bench@@ mark federal funds rate - even by no more than a m@@ ere quarter of a percentage point .
" obvi@@ ously the la@@ b@@ or market and inflation is going to be first and fore@@ most the most important thing they watch , " said L@@ in@@ d@@ se@@ y M@@ . Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economist at bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ f@@ el Nicola@@ us & Co .
" but I think if they were looking for an exc@@ use not to raise the rate , the increased uncertain@@ ty surrounding the global market@@ place is enough to provide them with justi@@ fication to wait further , " she said .
there 's no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself is ca@@ using financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
about half of econom@@ ists survey@@ ed recently by Bloomberg predic@@ ted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expec@@ ting the F@@ ed to hold off , with a key indic@@ ator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the F@@ ed ra@@ ises the rate , unless polic@@ y@@ makers were to sof@@ ten the blo@@ w by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on Tuesday , the Do@@ w J@@ ones industrial average jum@@ ped 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 8@@ 9 points , or 1.@@ 4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed polic@@ y@@ makers will hold the rate stead@@ y this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief economist at Moody 's Cap@@ ital Mar@@ kets Research Group .
" it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , " he said .
if F@@ ed polic@@ y@@ makers did , " they would have to go to great len@@ g@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets ' hands so they don ' t pan@@ ic . "
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertain@@ ty about when the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago , the F@@ ed se@@ e@@ med on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ ten@@ ing of monetary conditions that would val@@ id@@ ate the streng@@ th of the U@@ . S@@ . recovery .
Y@@ el@@ len had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , la@@ b@@ or market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed considers to be full employment .
wage gain@@ s have shown signs of pic@@ king up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , F@@ ed polic@@ y@@ makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy " can cop@@ e with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ t@@ ness of the la@@ b@@ or market , " said I@@ an S@@ he@@ ph@@ er@@ d@@ son , chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on mac@@ ro@@ econom@@ ics .
but financial markets around the world started conv@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Do@@ w J@@ ones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors f@@ ear@@ ed a slow@@ ing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has re@@ bo@@ unded some@@ what this month , with the Do@@ w now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
for F@@ ed polic@@ y@@ makers , the market tur@@ mo@@ il adds to the complex cal@@ cul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
" ab@@ sent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weak@@ ness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tigh@@ ten@@ ing at this meeting , " said Ste@@ ph@@ en D@@ . O@@ lin@@ er , a senior research fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Z@@ im@@ an C@@ enter for Re@@ al E@@ state and a former F@@ ed official .
now , he predic@@ ts they 'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
" there 's a lot of uncertain@@ ty about what the imp@@ acts on the U@@ . S@@ . economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post @ - @ dates the developments in China , " O@@ lin@@ er said .
the health of the global economy is@@ n ' t one of the F@@ ed 's primary concerns , so techn@@ ically it sho@@ uldn ' t be fac@@ to@@ red into its decision @ - @ making .
but , in effect , the F@@ ed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank 's influence in recent years has been enormous .
the m@@ ere hin@@ t by then @ - @ Chairman B@@ en S@@ . Ber@@ n@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed might " t@@ aper " its monetary expansion triggered market conv@@ ul@@ sions around the g@@ lo@@ be .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to cons@@ ult with other central ban@@ kers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision @ - @ making process is " more art than science , " said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ el@@ l , head of global strategy for we@@ alth @ - @ management firm En@@ v@@ est@@ net In@@ c .
J@@ eff@@ re@@ y L@@ ack@@ er , president of the F@@ ederal Res@@ er@@ ve Bank of Ric@@ h@@ mon@@ d , V@@ a . , noted this month that " the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reac@@ ting to financial market mov@@ ements that seem un@@ connected to economic funda@@ ment@@ als . "
L@@ ack@@ er , a voting member of the polic@@ y@@ making F@@ ederal Open Mar@@ ket Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998 @ - @ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to cut its bench@@ mark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings " despite limited identi@@ fi@@ able imp@@ lic@@ ations for U@@ . S@@ . growth , " L@@ ack@@ er said .
a year later , F@@ ed officials rever@@ sed those cuts .
the F@@ ed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market me@@ l@@ t@@ down , said A@@ dam S@@ . P@@ osen , a former member of the Bank of Eng@@ land 's rate @ - @ setting committee .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il doesn ' t come close to that level , he said .
" you certainly don ' t want to be put in a situation of being scar@@ ed of a rate hi@@ ke because markets got up@@ set , " said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
the F@@ ederal Res@@ er@@ ve Ac@@ t still has the du@@ al mandate and does not men@@ tion financial stability , and until that is changed , I don ' t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

Sar@@ ah Mac@@ K@@ ay believes she and S@@ am Wo@@ od would be well su@@ ited as a couple .
for her part , Mac@@ K@@ ay said last week 's home visit dates made her realise Wo@@ od could be " the one . "
" once I saw him with my friends and family I re@@ alised this obvi@@ ously is@@ n ' t just a game - I 'm wh@@ o@@ le@@ hear@@ tedly invested in him now , " she said .

J@@ ar@@ r@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options of where to begin his N@@ F@@ L career .
D@@ et@@ ro@@ it and Se@@ att@@ le showed p@@ len@@ ty of interest after his move to the US - and there were p@@ len@@ ty of other teams making in@@ qu@@ iri@@ es after his impres@@ sive open training day late last year .
but Hay@@ ne ch@@ ose the S@@ an Fran@@ c@@ is@@ co 4@@ 9@@ ers and coach J@@ im Tom@@ sul@@ a and it 's looking like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches would have ben@@ ched Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game for losing a f@@ um@@ ble like the A@@ us@@ si@@ e ru@@ g@@ by le@@ ague con@@ ver@@ t did on his first pun@@ t return in Tuesday 's 20 @ - @ 3 win against Min@@ nes@@ ot@@ a .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a showed fa@@ ith in his man , giving Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a pun@@ t and including him in the running game after an injur@@ y to Re@@ g@@ gi@@ e Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true c@@ olo@@ urs in the loc@@ ker room after the game .
instead of che@@ wing out his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also backed Hay@@ ne publicly in his post @ - @ match press conference .
4@@ 9@@ ers beat repor@@ ter C@@ am In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also received encour@@ agement from special teams co @ - @ ordinator T@@ ho@@ mas Mc@@ Ga@@ ug@@ hey , who advis@@ ed him to for@@ get about his dropped cat@@ ch and worry about the next play .

4 Kil@@ led Af@@ ter Police F@@ ire ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ lets at protesters in N@@ ep@@ al
four people , including a 4 @ - @ year @ - @ old bo@@ y , were killed in southern N@@ ep@@ al after the police fired ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstr@@ ating against the country 's proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 1@@ 75 mil@@ es west of Kath@@ man@@ du , the capital .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them thro@@ wing st@@ ones and fi@@ re@@ bom@@ bs .
Mr@@ . D@@ hak@@ al said the police used te@@ ar gas and then fired into the air before res@@ ort@@ ing to ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ lets .
tw@@ en@@ ty police officers and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ lets , which are known to k@@ ill but are tradi@@ tionally used as a less @ - @ le@@ th@@ al alternative , appar@@ ently produced such a high death tol@@ l .
the clas@@ h was the latest in weeks of violent protests across N@@ ep@@ al 's southern pla@@ ins , where members of the Mad@@ h@@ esi ethnic group say new prov@@ inc@@ es established under the proposed new constitution would dil@@ ute their political influence .
there have also been protests in western N@@ ep@@ al from ethnic T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Au@@ g .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divi@@ de the country into prov@@ inc@@ es - a major step to@@ ward a new constitution but a highly conten@@ ti@@ ous issue in N@@ ep@@ al , which has been c@@ entr@@ ally govern@@ ed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been under@@ way since 2008 , but lawmakers acceler@@ ated the process after the dev@@ ast@@ ating earthqu@@ ake that killed thousands of people in April .
lawmakers have been voting on cla@@ uses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ man@@ du this week , and officials have said that the new char@@ ter could be en@@ acted by Sunday .

Google took an un@@ character@@ isti@@ cally personal approach in announcing the don@@ ation drive on its blo@@ g .
rather than having an executive make the announcement , R@@ ita Mas@@ ou@@ d , a Google employe@@ e who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
" our jour@@ ney involved many dar@@ k train and bus ri@@ des , as well as hun@@ ger , thir@@ st , c@@ old and fear , " she wrote .
I was lu@@ ck@@ y .
but as the refugee and mig@@ rant crisis in Europe has gro@@ wn , many people like my family are desp@@ er@@ ate for help .
the don@@ ations will go to@@ ward four n@@ on@@ profit organiz@@ ations that are providing aid to refugees and mig@@ rants : doctors W@@ ith@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ c@@ ue Committee , S@@ ave the Ch@@ ildren and UN High Commissioner for Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .

for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics , we@@ ight loss sur@@ ger@@ y may be hel@@ p@@ ful
the benefits of we@@ ight loss sur@@ ger@@ y for mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it 's still to early to say whether mil@@ dly ob@@ ese people with di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes live longer after we@@ ight loss sur@@ ger@@ y than those who receive non @ - @ sur@@ gical treat@@ ments , however .
" the m@@ ort@@ ality data take a long time to show up , " said Dr. R@@ ob@@ in Bla@@ ck@@ stone , a we@@ ight loss sur@@ ger@@ y expert who wrote an edi@@ tor@@ ial on the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ ger@@ y .
we@@ ight loss operations , or bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric sur@@ ger@@ y , use various meth@@ ods to sh@@ r@@ ink the size of the sto@@ ma@@ ch .
they reduce hun@@ ger and limit the body 's ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric sur@@ ger@@ ies have proved effective for tre@@ ating type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bi@@ dly ob@@ ese , with a body mass index ( B@@ M@@ I ) of 35 or above .
B@@ M@@ I , a measure of we@@ ight in rela@@ tion to he@@ ight , is considered normal between 18@@ .5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a B@@ M@@ I of 25 or higher indi@@ cates that someone is over@@ we@@ ight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can cal@@ c@@ ulate your B@@ M@@ I here : 1 . u@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from T@@ ai@@ w@@ an 's M@@ in @ - @ S@@ hen@@ g General Hos@@ p@@ ital used data collected since 2007 in a trial compar@@ ing two kin@@ ds of bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric sur@@ ger@@ y - gas@@ tric b@@ y@@ pass and s@@ le@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treat@@ ments for type 2 di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes in people who were mil@@ dly ob@@ ese .
the average B@@ M@@ I among those who had sur@@ ger@@ y fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the B@@ M@@ I among those receiving non @ - @ sur@@ gical di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes treat@@ ments st@@ ay@@ ed about the same at 29 .
among those who had sur@@ ger@@ y , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes resolved completely in 36 per@@ cent and parti@@ ally in 28 per@@ cent .
in the medi@@ cally @ - @ treated group , by compar@@ ison , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes resolved completely in only 1 per@@ cent and parti@@ ally in only about 2 per@@ cent .
in addition , control of blo@@ od pressure , trig@@ ly@@ cer@@ ides , and " bad " L@@ D@@ L cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol " was generally better in the sur@@ gical group , " the auth@@ ors found .
the researchers also monit@@ ored patients ' blo@@ od levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blo@@ od su@@ gar levels over time .
H@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 per@@ cent , the researchers wr@@ ite .
after sur@@ ger@@ y , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 per@@ cent to about 6 per@@ cent .
in the medical ther@@ ap@@ y group , however , it remained stead@@ y at about 8 per@@ cent .
but this better " g@@ ly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control " - as reflec@@ ted by the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the m@@ ort@@ ality rate at five years , according to lead resear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h @ - @ Ch@@ en@@ g HS@@ U and colleagues .
the research team also compared average out@@ comes with the two ty@@ pes of sur@@ ger@@ y .
at the fifth year , compared to the s@@ le@@ eve g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the b@@ y@@ pass sur@@ ger@@ y group had lost more we@@ ight ( 18@@ .@@ 7 v@@ s 14@@ .@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger dro@@ ps in B@@ M@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 v@@ s 5.@@ 1 ) and in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 per@@ cent v@@ s 2.@@ 1 per@@ cent ) and were more likely to have complete di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 per@@ cent v@@ s 16@@ .@@ 7 per@@ cent ) .
while the new study does not show a survi@@ val benefit or sur@@ ger@@ y after five years , there is evidence from a study of heav@@ ier people in Sweden that sur@@ ger@@ y does lead to a longer life , says Bla@@ ck@@ stone , of the University of A@@ riz@@ ona Col@@ le@@ ge of Medi@@ cine @ - @ P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x .
in the Swedish study , ob@@ ese people who had bar@@ i@@ at@@ ric sur@@ ger@@ y were about 29 per@@ cent less likely to di@@ e over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conven@@ tional meth@@ ods .
though the new study didn ' t show a benefit in survi@@ val among sur@@ ger@@ y patients , Bla@@ ck@@ stone said it 's re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a B@@ M@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
" this is where this paper is critical , because it says this sur@@ ger@@ y is safe in that lower B@@ M@@ I group , " with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al dis@@ ease , she said .
Bla@@ ck@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking we@@ ight seriously once the pati@@ ent 's B@@ M@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
" I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , " she said .
I think that once they 've ac@@ cum@@ ulated these gen@@ e@@ tic changes that har@@ d@@ wi@@ red their bodies into ob@@ es@@ ity and di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes , re@@ vers@@ ing that is really hard .
" it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe " - Dal@@ ai L@@ ama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
the Ti@@ bet@@ an Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees " home countries .
the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama Centre for comp@@ as@@ sion in O@@ x@@ for@@ d , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies , at the beginning of his 10 @ - @ day visit to the UK .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even contin@@ ents .
he also stressed that , however ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ ble , the West @ - @ European countries " response to the refugee crisis is in@@ adequate to the situation .
" it it 's impossible for everyone to come to Europe , " he said in his speech .
although the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama praised Germany 's and Austria 's efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
" so taking care of several thous@@ and refugees is won@@ der@@ ful , but in the mean time you have to think about long @ - @ term solutions , how to bring gen@@ u@@ ine peace and gen@@ u@@ ine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , " he emphas@@ ized .
ulti@@ mately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , " he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama also commen@@ ted on George Bush 's actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US " violent response en@@ gen@@ dered a chain of un@@ control@@ la@@ ble events .
after 9 / 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non @ - @ violence .
I know his mo@@ tives were good but he used force and it created un@@ expected consequences , " the Dal@@ ai L@@ ama said .
fo@@ ur@@ f@@ old increase in children ing@@ esting hand san@@ itiz@@ er in last 4 years

according to Dr. G@@ ay@@ lor@@ d L@@ op@@ ez , director of the Georgia po@@ ison C@@ enter , hand san@@ itiz@@ er ing@@ es@@ tion cases in children under 12 that were reported to po@@ ison control cen@@ ters went up from 3,@@ 2@@ 66 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .

" a k@@ id is not thin@@ king this is bad for them , " L@@ op@@ ez said .
a lot of the more attractive ( hand san@@ itiz@@ ers ) are the ones that are scen@@ ted .
there are stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry , grap@@ e , oran@@ ge @ - @ fla@@ vo@@ red hand san@@ itiz@@ ers that are very appe@@ aling to ki@@ ds .
hand san@@ itiz@@ er con@@ tains any@@ where between 45 and 95 per@@ cent alco@@ hol .
in young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alco@@ hol po@@ is@@ oning .
" it 's highly conc@@ ent@@ rated alco@@ hol , " Dr. Ste@@ ph@@ en Th@@ or@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison control cen@@ ter at University of Kan@@ sas Hos@@ p@@ ital , told Fo@@ x 4 in Kan@@ sas City .
so you wo@@ uldn ' t leave a shot of wh@@ is@@ key s@@ it@@ ting around , but people will have these hand san@@ itiz@@ ers out and if ki@@ ds get into it , it 's a quick way to consum@@ e a lot of alco@@ hol .

N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah was s@@ l@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to wal@@ k when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monit@@ ored her over@@ night at a separate children 's hospital for any signs of bra@@ in tra@@ uma , as the alco@@ hol caused the gir@@ l to fall and hit her head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
" that was very sc@@ ary , " Or@@ tor@@ ia Scot@@ t , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah 's mother , told CNN .
it could have been very le@@ th@@ al for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers use n@@ on@@ alco@@ hol@@ ic products or san@@ itiz@@ ing wi@@ pes short of moving hand san@@ itiz@@ er out of a child 's reach .
beyond alco@@ hol po@@ is@@ oning , some san@@ itiz@@ ers have been linked to deaths .

just the len@@ g@@ th of the cro@@ co@@ dile 's s@@ kul@@ l was meas@@ ured as 1.6 metres .
the researchers named the spec@@ ies " Mac@@ him@@ os@@ aur@@ us re@@ x " and published their findings in the magazine C@@ ret@@ ac@@ e@@ ous Research .
the lead author of the article , Feder@@ ic@@ o F@@ anti from B@@ olo@@ gn@@ a University , stated that the fos@@ sil was under@@ stood to date from 130 million years ago and " it is nearly the size of a bus . "
speaking to the Washington Post , F@@ anti said that the huge salt water cro@@ co@@ dile " was at the top of the food chain at least in a certain region , during that age . "
pal@@ a@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ologists stated that M@@ . re@@ x , believed to be the biggest cro@@ co@@ dile living in the sea , hun@@ ted in la@@ go@@ ons by lying in wait .

all their min@@ ds are very conf@@ used !
the first book from writer E@@ ce T@@ eme@@ l@@ kur@@ an published in 1996 , " Al@@ l the Women 's Min@@ ds Ar@@ e conf@@ used " was adap@@ ted for theatre with the same name by the Ay@@ sa Pro@@ duction Theatre .
S@@ ele@@ n U@@ ç@@ er direc@@ ts the play in which Deniz Ç@@ ak@@ ır , Z@@ ey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ kon@@ de , İ@@ pek Türk@@ tan Kay@@ nak , K@@ adi@@ r Çer@@ mik and Ş@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ ön@@ mez play a part .
U@@ ç@@ er , whose plays " Po@@ z " and " Kur@@ u S@@ ık@@ ı " are still ongoing , had her first experience of s@@ cri@@ pt wr@@ iting and direc@@ ting in the play , which questions the conf@@ u@@ sion in women 's min@@ ds .
the play was introduced to an audience in the Tr@@ um@@ p Per@@ for@@ man@@ ce Centre last week .
the play opens with a radio play .
a voice in the dar@@ k , taking us back to past years ...
then the cur@@ tain goes up .
a woman , who is s@@ it@@ ting on a win@@ dow le@@ dge , is on the ver@@ ge of jum@@ ping .
who she is and why she is trying to comm@@ it suic@@ ide are under@@ stood after the intervention of the next @ - @ door neighbours .
she left A letter
" E@@ br@@ u Uy@@ sal , " played by Deniz Ç@@ ak@@ ır , is a popular writer .
she was left by her hus@@ band , but this is not the only reason .
there are some things that have ac@@ cum@@ ulated inside her .
she was brought to this moment because of the fact that she did not enjoy pat@@ er@@ nal love , her ch@@ ild@@ hood was spent in l@@ on@@ el@@ iness , and the fact that she thinks that she is not under@@ stood .
she decided to comm@@ it suic@@ ide , left a letter behind , but she can not jum@@ p from the win@@ dow .
because " Ay@@ sel " ( Z@@ ey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ kon@@ de ) , the pr@@ att@@ ling , gul@@ li@@ ble cle@@ an@@ er and next @ - @ door neighbour , and " Per@@ ran " ( Ş@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ ön@@ mez ) , the my@@ ster@@ ious woman in the op@@ pos@@ ite fla@@ t , draw her into con@@ vers@@ ation .
they approach the situation as if it were a normal , ordinary situation .
the woman becomes more stressed ; she could not conc@@ entr@@ ate and jum@@ p .
when the famous singer " M@@ el@@ te@@ m K@@ aya " ( İ@@ pek Türk@@ tan Kay@@ nak ) , who is having her home cle@@ an@@ ed , join@@ s the con@@ vers@@ ation between the three , the situation tur@@ ns into a c@@ lam@@ our of voic@@ es .
appro@@ ac@@ hing the situation with her n@@ ai@@ ve and s@@ inc@@ ere st@@ yle , " M@@ el@@ te@@ m " can not help but sing when she sees a crowd .
this interes@@ ting attempt at suic@@ ide takes on a different di@@ men@@ sion with the appearance of real estate ag@@ ent " Mur@@ at " ( K@@ adi@@ r Çer@@ mik ) with a spar@@ e key .
the situation gets out of hand when the singer " M@@ el@@ te@@ m " gives very in@@ ac@@ cur@@ ate information to the press .
the song " Sok@@ ak K@@ ızı " by N@@ az@@ an Ön@@ c@@ el is also used in the play .
co@@ me@@ dy of de@@ pres@@ sion
direc@@ ting on the stage for the first time , U@@ ç@@ er was successful in ensuring the temp@@ o and f@@ low of the play .
Z@@ ey@@ ne@@ p Kan@@ kon@@ de and İ@@ pek Türk@@ tan Kay@@ nak carry the burden of co@@ me@@ dy in the play .
the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated charac@@ ters played by this du@@ o succeed in making the audience la@@ ug@@ h with both their mim@@ ics and lines .
while Ş@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ ön@@ mez conv@@ ey@@ s her years of experience on the stage very well , Deniz Ç@@ ak@@ ır deli@@ vers a per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve performance in reflec@@ ting the de@@ pres@@ sed mo@@ od of " E@@ br@@ u Uy@@ sal . "
making an in@@ deli@@ ble impres@@ sion with his performance in Tol@@ ga Ç@@ elik 's award @ - @ winning film " Sar@@ maş@@ ık , " K@@ adi@@ r Çer@@ mik successfully ac@@ companies these four women .
defined as a co@@ me@@ dy of de@@ pres@@ sion , the one @ - @ act play promises to make you la@@ ug@@ h without conf@@ using the mind .
here is what st@@ ay@@ ed in my mind from these be@@ auti@@ ful words mostly coming from the m@@ outh of " Per@@ ran , " played by Ş@@ eb@@ ne@@ m S@@ ön@@ mez : do not s@@ cri@@ b@@ ble has@@ ti@@ ly , they will read it ; do not live has@@ ti@@ ly , they will see you .
most children pos@@ sibly thought of d@@ ying to pun@@ ish their fa@@ thers and mo@@ thers , and they some@@ how ended up cr@@ ying at the thought .
the woman is han@@ ging in the air like an un@@ re@@ alised j@@ oke .
the woman sear@@ ches for a fun@@ ny story that she has always for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten a part of .
in fact , every story begins with a kind of being aband@@ on@@ ment .
I should put my hands into my po@@ c@@ ket , I can not stand anything without po@@ c@@ kets .
people do not know where to put their hands .
since we do not know it , our hands multi@@ ply .
people b@@ ad@@ m@@ outh what they do not know ; they fabri@@ c@@ ate and fabri@@ c@@ ate .
a mis@@ understanding becomes reality .
all the women 's heads are conf@@ used because they are mes@@ sed up by someone .
if you are not able to di@@ e , you have a chance to live .
" dr@@ ink ke@@ f@@ ir and live longer "
it can be consu@@ med saf@@ ely at any age
expressing that one of the n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents that can be consu@@ med saf@@ ely by everyone of every age is ke@@ f@@ ir , a mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent which is more benef@@ ic@@ ial than its main base of milk and whose health benefits are completely un@@ coun@@ table , the speci@@ alist di@@ eti@@ ci@@ an P@@ ın@@ ar Kur@@ al En@@ ç said that , " I@@ t is more n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ti@@ ous than yo@@ g@@ hur@@ t because it includes prote@@ in , basic min@@ er@@ als and v@@ it@@ am@@ in B@@ . "
it is rich in v@@ it@@ am@@ in B@@ 1 , B@@ 12 and K@@ .
thanks to its cal@@ ci@@ um and ma@@ gn@@ es@@ ium content , it cre@@ ates the basis for a health@@ y ner@@ v@@ ous system .
it is also a good source of ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ ous .
in addition , having the feature of feel@@ ing full , ke@@ f@@ ir does not make you gain we@@ ight .
she said , " its n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional value is high and it is a di@@ ges@@ ti@@ ble dr@@ ink . "
c@@ ure @ - @ all
expla@@ ining that children , the el@@ derly , expec@@ tant mo@@ thers and women entering the period of men@@ op@@ ause can consum@@ e ke@@ f@@ ir without hes@@ itation , the speci@@ alist di@@ eti@@ ci@@ an P@@ ın@@ ar Kur@@ al En@@ ç said , " K@@ ef@@ ir is originally a local dr@@ ink made in the Ca@@ uc@@ as@@ us . "
however it started to become famous around the world .
being the secret of y@@ ou@@ th@@ ful@@ ness and an eli@@ x@@ ir for a long an health@@ y life , ke@@ f@@ ir c@@ ures nearly all conditions .
K@@ ef@@ ir is one of the most natural ways to protect ba@@ bi@@ es from Met@@ abol@@ ic ill@@ nesses .
In@@ test@@ ine @ - @ friendly
this unique be@@ ver@@ age , con@@ taining coun@@ t@@ less benefits , is in@@ test@@ ine @ - @ friendly .
there are around 1.5 @ - @ 2 kil@@ os of bac@@ ter@@ ia and fun@@ gu@@ s in our in@@ test@@ ines .
m@@ ic@@ ro @ - @ organis@@ ms in the di@@ ges@@ tive system are divided into two groups : benef@@ ic@@ ial and de@@ tri@@ mental ones .
benef@@ ic@@ ial m@@ ic@@ ro @ - @ organis@@ ms are called " pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tic m@@ ic@@ ro @ - @ organis@@ ms . "
the activities of pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tics have an important effect as much as our li@@ ver , and if they are consu@@ med su@@ ffici@@ ently they prevent de@@ tri@@ mental m@@ ic@@ ro @ - @ organis@@ ms in the in@@ test@@ ines from sti@@ cking and sp@@ reading to the in@@ test@@ in@@ al w@@ all .
I@@ mp@@ air@@ ment of the balance of health@@ y m@@ ic@@ ro @ - @ organis@@ ms in the in@@ test@@ ine ca@@ uses dis@@ ease .
the health of the di@@ ges@@ tive tr@@ act should be protected through proper no@@ ur@@ is@@ hment .
to do this , we should certainly consum@@ e a sufficient amount of pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tics .
it resol@@ ves all these problems found in the in@@ test@@ ine
K@@ ef@@ ir is the most effective pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tic inclu@@ sive n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent and the benef@@ ic@@ ial bac@@ ter@@ ia inside of it has a great effect in the strengthening of the in@@ test@@ in@@ al system .
it enab@@ les the good bac@@ ter@@ ia and fun@@ gu@@ s in the in@@ test@@ ines to re@@ produce health@@ ily and to benefit us .
with regular use of ke@@ f@@ ir , the in@@ test@@ ines will function , in@@ test@@ in@@ al dis@@ orders will be resolved , blo@@ ating will be reduced , and health@@ ier di@@ ges@@ tion will be obtained .
a health@@ y di@@ ges@@ tive system means a health@@ y and dis@@ ease @ - @ free body .
she said , " K@@ ef@@ ir also c@@ ures loss of appe@@ ti@@ te , In@@ som@@ n@@ ia , up@@ per res@@ pir@@ atory tr@@ act inf@@ ec@@ tions and al@@ ler@@ gies , and will help ba@@ bi@@ es to absor@@ b v@@ it@@ am@@ ins and min@@ er@@ als from fo@@ ods more effici@@ ently , so it under@@ takes an important role in the n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion of ba@@ bi@@ es .

according to data from the university , U@@ M@@ IC@@ H , the index reached 9@@ 3.@@ 3 because of a 0.@@ 7 point increase in January in compar@@ ison to December .

Putin e@@ ats his words
while Russia is preparing to recognise the status of " able to do business with Russia " for Turkish companies if it can not replace the services offered by Turkey , the head of the Russian T@@ our Oper@@ ators Union stated , " Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey . "
cal@@ c@@ ula@@ ting that c@@ utting current economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia , the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia prepared a new " excep@@ tional cases " bill for the Russian Government regarding Turkey .
according to the proposal , published in the Russian F@@ ederal Re@@ gula@@ tion , giving per@@ mission to Turkish companies and firms is allowed when it becomes necessary even in the area of sanctions .
according to the proposal , goods and services from Turkish companies and firms will be used in cases where it is impossible to provide them from sources other than Turkey and domestic production in Russia brings serious additional costs .
the committee formed within the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia with other related ministries will determine which services and goods of Turkish origin will be included in this category .
therefore , officials will selec@@ t and decide which Turkish companies will be able to work with Russia .
moreover , according to this document , state organiz@@ ations and private companies in Russia will have to prove that there is no Russian equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent for the business they will do with Turkish partners .
in the case that the proposal is approved by the Russian government and takes effect , the pre@@ ferred Turkish companies will be registered in Russia .
the Russian T@@ our Oper@@ ators Union expressed that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey in the ex@@ plan@@ ation it made y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
the ex@@ plan@@ ation includes the following : " in sp@@ ite of the ban on the sale of tour@@ s and the ad@@ vice of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia to not go to Turkey , our citizens have started to search for ways to organize their holiday by themselves . "
the number of the posts titled " the most practical and the che@@ ap@@ est way to take a holiday in Turkey " ke@@ ep@@ s s@@ no@@ w@@ bal@@ ling in social media on the internet .
the most widespread ad@@ vice is to make online hotel reser@@ v@@ ations and to f@@ ly with Turkish Airlines .
the Russian Prime Minister D@@ mit@@ ry Medvedev defined the oil price fal@@ ling under 30 dol@@ lar@@ s as a " dra@@ ma@@ tical development " from Russia 's vie@@ w@@ point .
Medvedev said , " No@@ body thought that pet@@ ro@@ leum would fall under 30 dol@@ lar@@ s and it was also a big surprise for our government . "
he said , " A@@ t this rate , it seems impossible to implement the budget as is now . "
we passed the last month of 2015 .
after the shot @ - @ down plan@@ e crisis , Russian President Putin announ@@ ces that economic sanctions will be intensi@@ fied .
in those days , our businessmen and our Turkish Airlines staff suffered a lot , trying to go to Russia in the us@@ ual way .
obstacles are set for Turkish goods at customs , and they are sub@@ j@@ ected to un@@ thin@@ kab@@ le chec@@ ks .
1 month , not much , pass@@ es from then ti@@ ll now , and Ner@@ du@@ n H@@ ac@@ ı@@ oğlu reports from Moscow y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
one way or another , sanctions are being e@@ ased one by one .
all right , but why ?
the reason is simple .
it is because the closing of border crossings with the meth@@ ods of a century ago and efforts to con@@ ver@@ t a political fight into an economic fight are no longer effective in an era when the economy has become so g@@ lob@@ alised .
look , we are continuing to wr@@ ite news about how the economic embar@@ go implemented against Iran for many years was fl@@ ou@@ ted .
Russia and Turkey are countries that seem to have many allies but actually don ' t have so many , and they are dependent upon each other .
it is not techn@@ ically possible to separate the two countries in one night , connected through their businessmen , tourists , entrepren@@ eur@@ s and customers .
if you close the doors , the people of these two countries will enter each other 's countries from the ch@@ im@@ ney .
the most correc@@ t way is to have political discussion and to make terms at the table before the sanctions create new Re@@ za Z@@ ar@@ ra@@ bs ( R@@ ıza Sar@@ raf ) .
without involving the econom@@ ics ...

it has been discovered that the suspects , after lear@@ ning the card pass@@ words , then made trans@@ actions with these cards .
the suspects were taken into custody at the end of the operation .

it is because Ran@@ gers ar@@ en ' t there .

Scot@@ land 's unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the UK 's rate of 5@@ .5 per cent , the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ons ) figures showed .

why I 'm A W@@ it@@ ness A@@ t A@@ n Ex@@ ec@@ ution I@@ n Ok@@ lah@@ om@@ a
later today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
if it happen@@ s , and I hope it won ' t , I will sit in a vie@@ wing gal@@ lery in the death cham@@ ber at Ok@@ lah@@ om@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is execu@@ ted by le@@ th@@ al in@@ j@@ ection .
he has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
as the day appro@@ aches , I 've come to dre@@ ad it .
so why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penal@@ ty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are per@@ mitted to watch execu@@ tions in America and because there are often more applic@@ ations than seats available , a ma@@ cab@@ re l@@ ot@@ tery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Ok@@ lah@@ om@@ a has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
wh@@ o@@ ever is pic@@ ked will watch it dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ately .
I can not do that .
I will be s@@ it@@ ting al@@ ong@@ side Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p 's clos@@ est friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two @ - @ and @ - @ a @ - @ half hours .
I like the gu@@ y .
we often la@@ ug@@ h a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say I can not be both a witness and a journalist , so I won ' t be allowed a no@@ te@@ book and p@@ en to record what I see .
I will just have to try to re@@ member all the details .
one Ok@@ lah@@ om@@ a journalist accused me on T@@ wit@@ ter of com@@ promising my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here 's the les@@ son .
tell the in@@ mate 's story the way he lik@@ es it , get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she admitted that she " could have ph@@ r@@ ased it better , " but still thinks I 'm wrong to do what I 'm doing .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I 've said and written .
he doesn ' t tell me what to wr@@ ite , and I wo@@ uldn ' t do it even if he did .
I 've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be there to wr@@ ite about it .
if he dies , he thinks the public@@ ity will help the anti @ - @ death penal@@ ty movement .
K@@ im Bel@@ l@@ w@@ are , a repor@@ ter from the H@@ u@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be al@@ ong@@ side me .
if you want to know more about the case , ple@@ ase lis@@ ten to the series of po@@ d@@ cas@@ ts I 've made .
I won ' t go over all the details again here .
I can not say with certain@@ ty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is in@@ no@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ y after the fact .
but I believe there is a strong pro@@ b@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I believe his ex@@ ec@@ ution is wrong .
and it 's from this perspective that I will watch him di@@ e .
I can not claim to be tr@@ uly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it 's like to watch a man I like di@@ e an un@@ necessary death .

Peter Moody has alleged R@@ ac@@ ing Vic@@ tor@@ ia ste@@ wards attemp@@ ted to plant a sp@@ y in his st@@ ab@@ les last year and threatened to qu@@ it rac@@ ing immediately .
he took aim at ste@@ wards and R@@ ac@@ ing Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's integrity department , alleg@@ ing they have a personal campaign against him with the late s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of L@@ ad@@ y Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moody told F@@ air@@ fax Media he had always tried to do what is best for rac@@ ing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to L@@ idari 's positive s@@ wa@@ b to co@@ bal@@ t , which he can not expla@@ in .
he had bit@@ ten his ton@@ gue about the sp@@ y allegations for 18 months and didn ' t want it " to look like s@@ our grap@@ es . "
" I was@@ n ' t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so fru@@ stra@@ ted it all comes out at once , " Moody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you re@@ act and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and s@@ le@@ ep well .
I want to wal@@ k around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start to think I 'm not that 's when I sho@@ uldn ' t be a tra@@ in@@ er .
I would then have to consider what I do with my lic@@ ence .
earlier , Moody had dropped the bomb@@ shel@@ l in a rac@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y on his stable .
" E@@ igh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Bro@@ wn and D@@ r Bri@@ an Ste@@ war@@ t sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ab@@ les to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ab@@ les , " Moody said on R@@ ac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obvi@@ ously believe I 'm a che@@ at .
if that 's the case su@@ rely they should all hand in their brief@@ s because they 've been in@@ compet@@ ent in trying to cat@@ ch me .
Robert Ro@@ ul@@ st@@ on , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ di@@ e , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Ber@@ n@@ ard Sa@@ un@@ d@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it 's becoming personal ?
has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of bal@@ ls and may@@ be make people outside of tra@@ in@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I that bad for the industry ?
may@@ be people out there think I am .
may@@ be they need to take my lic@@ ence off me and push me away and I 've got no doubt what I 'm saying now might make them think about that .
but I 've got to the point now where I don ' t care and that sad@@ den@@ s me .
that really sad@@ den@@ s me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I 've got the support of my family and I can wal@@ k away .
the tra@@ in@@ er 's fru@@ stration levels have built with the long @ - @ running co@@ bal@@ t in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y involving L@@ idari and the late s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching had him saying that he could " th@@ row my lic@@ ence across the table . "
Moody , best known for preparing un@@ be@@ aten champion Black Cav@@ i@@ ar , la@@ bel@@ led the race @ - @ day treatment rule " ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous " after a mu@@ d or cla@@ y po@@ ul@@ tice had been applied to the hor@@ ses leg@@ s , which is against the rules .
it 's against the rules of rac@@ ing .
I 've got to accept full responsibility for that , " he said .
one of my staff mist@@ aken@@ ly la@@ ced mu@@ d on its le@@ g .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
Moody could be faced with a three @ - @ month dis@@ qual@@ ification for the race day treatment using the po@@ ul@@ tice , which ste@@ wards have opened an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into .
it is a j@@ oke .
people making these rules know nothing about the hor@@ se .
" we all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , " Moody said .
Cob@@ ram hit @ - @ and @ - @ run dri@@ ver arrested

on Monday a 50 @ - @ year @ - @ old N@@ ath@@ al@@ ia man handed himself in to police at S@@ hep@@ par@@ ton .

M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne St@@ or@@ m coach C@@ rai@@ g Bel@@ lam@@ y h@@ its back at ri@@ v@@ als over w@@ rest@@ ling claims
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne St@@ or@@ m coach C@@ rai@@ g Bel@@ lam@@ y has called criticism of his side 's tack@@ ling as " agenda setting " by the N@@ RL 's two premi@@ er@@ ship favour@@ i@@ tes .
Sy@@ d@@ ney Ro@@ os@@ ters coach Tr@@ ent R@@ ob@@ in@@ son said the refer@@ ees allowed the St@@ or@@ m to " w@@ rest@@ le " his side during the St@@ or@@ m 's up@@ set win in the qual@@ if@@ ying final in Sy@@ d@@ ney on Friday night .
Br@@ is@@ ban@@ e Br@@ on@@ co@@ s coach W@@ ay@@ ne Ben@@ net@@ t made a thin@@ ly ve@@ iled refer@@ ence to the St@@ or@@ m after his side 's qual@@ if@@ ying final win over North Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night when he called that game a " sho@@ w@@ case " of the ru@@ g@@ by le@@ ague and said the two Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land w@@ eren ' t " too big " into w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y def@@ ended his side 's tack@@ ling and said they just focused on their " contact " when tack@@ ling .
Bel@@ lam@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ aches critic@@ ise his side as it meant they were concerned about the St@@ or@@ m be@@ ating them .
" that ke@@ ep@@ s coming up - I didn ' t he@@ ar Tr@@ ent R@@ ob@@ in@@ son bring up w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24 @ - @ 2 , " Bel@@ lam@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we ha@@ ven ' t changed nothing all year with our def@@ en@@ sive systems or tech@@ ni@@ ques , it 's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphas@@ is with our contact in tack@@ les and that has been the turn around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there three years and he obvi@@ ously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a sho@@ ck to him .
it 's fun@@ ny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bel@@ lam@@ y challen@@ ged Ben@@ net@@ t 's idea of " ex@@ citing football " remin@@ ding his men@@ tor that Ben@@ net@@ t 's S@@ t George @ - @ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra dra@@ g@@ ons won the premi@@ er@@ ship in 2010 by playing " bor@@ ing " football .
W@@ ay@@ ne is talking about ex@@ citing foot@@ y .
he made a point of compar@@ ing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how ex@@ citing their game was , " Bel@@ lam@@ y said .
I re@@ member in 2010 S@@ t George was criticised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and W@@ ay@@ ne said he didn ' t give a r@@ at 's ar@@ se .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as ex@@ citing foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
that 's the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sor@@ t of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his st@@ yle of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like An@@ th@@ ony Mil@@ for@@ d and B@@ en Hun@@ t so they can play like that .
to me it buil@@ ds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably w@@ eren ' t thin@@ king of us when they get to the big games .
Bel@@ lam@@ y also pointed out the St@@ or@@ m and Ro@@ os@@ ters game was a higher s@@ cor@@ ing contest than the Br@@ on@@ co@@ s and C@@ ow@@ boys game .
the Br@@ on@@ co@@ s game was probably a good game , I ha@@ ven ' t wat@@ ched it yet but what was the score ? 16 @ - @ 12 ?
our game it was 20 @ - @ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that ex@@ citing foot@@ y ?
or is it making break@@ s and not s@@ cor@@ ing tries that is ex@@ citing ?
to me it 's agen@@ da@@ s .
if they are men@@ tioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the St@@ or@@ m have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la S@@ har@@ ks in next Saturday night 's preliminary final at A@@ AM@@ I Par@@ k with tic@@ kets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k ba@@ il on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attemp@@ ting to pos@@ s@@ ess 40 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms of co@@ ca@@ ine that was smugg@@ led into Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land has been granted ba@@ il on a $ 200,000 su@@ re@@ ty .
Marko Mak@@ sim@@ ovic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police trac@@ ked 100 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms of the drug from the y@@ ac@@ ht S@@ olay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and doc@@ ked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was obser@@ ved meeting with his co @ - @ accused at the mar@@ ina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ ad@@ house caf@@ e , where police found 40 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms of the drug in a T@@ oy@@ ot@@ a Echo .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attemp@@ ting to pos@@ s@@ ess a commercial qu@@ anti@@ ty of co@@ ca@@ ine , Mak@@ sim@@ ovic 's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attemp@@ ting to pos@@ s@@ ess all of it and that he might have been at the caf@@ e for an in@@ no@@ cent purpose .
Supreme Court Ju@@ dge Peter F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an was concerned Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was a f@@ light risk .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
he trav@@ els to Serbia often , " he told the court on Wednesday .
on the cro@@ wn case he lied to police about where he was st@@ ay@@ ing .
Mak@@ sim@@ ovic 's mother and ste@@ p@@ father had jointly offered a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
" having read the af@@ fi@@ dav@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the im@@ position of a su@@ re@@ ty of $ 200,000 constitu@@ tes a real financial burden on them , " Ju@@ dge F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an said .
but that alone was insufficient to de@@ ter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was granted ba@@ il on the conditions that he surrender both his Austral@@ ian and Serbian passports , report to police on a daily basis and ad@@ her@@ es to a 6 p@@ m @ - @ 6 am cur@@ few .
Ste@@ van Ho@@ g@@ g used gir@@ ls phone to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send i@@ mages
a pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile used an 11 @ - @ year @ - @ old gir@@ l 's phone to sol@@ ic@@ it child abuse i@@ mages .
Ste@@ van Ho@@ g@@ g took the gir@@ l 's phone as she s@@ le@@ pt then log@@ ged into an online mes@@ sa@@ ging service where he had a suc@@ cession of in@@ dec@@ ent i@@ mages of children sent to him by another us@@ er .
the gir@@ l later w@@ oke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in s@@ le@@ eping Ho@@ g@@ g 's hand .
she lo@@ oked through it and found the dist@@ ur@@ bing messages before immediately al@@ er@@ ting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pic@@ tures , then analy@@ sed computers found at the address and discovered " concerning " web sear@@ ches using terms for finding in@@ dec@@ ent image of children .
Ho@@ g@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would " lead pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es " on the internet before " pre@@ ten@@ ding he was a police officer to sc@@ are them . "
fiscal dep@@ ute E@@ il@@ id@@ h Robertson told D@@ un@@ de@@ e S@@ her@@ if@@ f Court : " he said it was an addi@@ ction - that he was addi@@ c@@ ted to scar@@ ing people .
he accepted the sear@@ ches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pre@@ ten@@ d to be a police officer to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his con@@ vers@@ ations with the un@@ known person who sent him the i@@ mages and him asking them to send more ph@@ otos .
he said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
he said he was si@@ ck in the head when he was dr@@ in@@ king and said he wants to view rap@@ e and murder i@@ mages .
MS Robertson added : " when the gir@@ l found the messages on the phone she sh@@ ou@@ ted her mother and was shak@@ ing and cr@@ ying .
she saw the in@@ dec@@ ent i@@ mages on the phone and the accused was then confron@@ ted .
the gir@@ l was inter@@ viewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and P@@ lay@@ St@@ ation to talk to gir@@ ls who lo@@ oked way youn@@ ger than him .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , of W@@ ard Ro@@ ad , D@@ un@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making in@@ dec@@ ent i@@ mages of children on June 14 last year , b@@ reaching ba@@ il on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence sol@@ ic@@ it@@ or Gre@@ gor SI@@ M asked that Ho@@ g@@ g not be placed on the se@@ x offen@@ ders reg@@ ister as it may be argued there was " no significant se@@ x@@ ual ele@@ ment " to his crime .
S@@ her@@ if@@ f Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ m@@ ic@@ ha@@ el de@@ ferred sentence until October for social work back@@ ground reports .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted ba@@ il in this case but was held in custody ahead of hear@@ ings on other outstanding cases .
he was placed on the se@@ x offen@@ ders reg@@ ister ahead of his senten@@ cing date .
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we 's Robert M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e deli@@ vers wrong speech in parliament
M@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e , Africa 's ol@@ dest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ di@@ um .
he was un@@ hur@@ t , but video of the fall went vir@@ al on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tar@@ n@@ ished by claims by opposition legisla@@ tors that they had received an@@ ony@@ mous death threats warning them against bo@@ o@@ ing M@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e during his address .
last month , they bo@@ o@@ ed and hec@@ k@@ led him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repe@@ ated on Tuesday .
movement for Democratic Chan@@ ge ( M@@ D@@ C ) chief wh@@ ip In@@ no@@ cent G@@ on@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile ph@@ ones warning them not to dis@@ rupt N@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e 's address .
" the message is coming from a number which is not reflec@@ ting but it 's titled ' death ' , " he told journalists after M@@ r M@@ ug@@ ab@@ e 's speech .
it warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief wh@@ ip said the party , led by M@@ organ Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is " wor@@ ried " about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t @ - @ Pac@@ kar@@ d to cut up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ let@@ t @ - @ Pac@@ kar@@ d expects to cut 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost @ - @ sav@@ ing efforts at it enter@@ prise services business .
HP is sp@@ lit@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating its computer and prin@@ ter businesses from its fas@@ ter @ - @ growing corpor@@ ate har@@ d@@ w@@ are and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7 b@@ n , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
" these restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pac@@ kar@@ d En@@ ter@@ prise , " said Me@@ g W@@ hit@@ man , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
" He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pac@@ kar@@ d En@@ ter@@ prise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep port@@ fol@@ io of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new st@@ yle of business , " said W@@ hit@@ man .
as a separate company , we are better positi@@ oned than ever to meet the evol@@ ving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pac@@ kar@@ d En@@ ter@@ prise will have more than $ 5@@ 0@@ b@@ n in annual revenue and " will be focused on deliver@@ ing un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed integrated technology solutions " to companies , according to a company statement .
it break@@ s up a company formed in the 19@@ 30@@ s by Stan@@ for@@ d University gradu@@ ates B@@ ill He@@ w@@ let@@ t and D@@ ave Pac@@ kar@@ d to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to gar@@ age has been dubbed " the bir@@ th@@ place of Sil@@ ic@@ on Val@@ ley . "
HP has been under@@ going a massive re@@ organisation to cop@@ e with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile dev@@ ices .
the move by HP , the world 's second @ - @ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US te@@ ch firms , is the latest in the sector based on the beli@@ ef that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
ar@@ sen@@ al cap@@ tain Mi@@ kel Ar@@ te@@ ta says team @ - @ ma@@ tes must get behind injured J@@ ack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of Din@@ am@@ o Zagreb ti@@ e
W@@ en@@ ger has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabil@@ itation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can not be back playing by Christmas .
that best @ - @ case scenar@@ io already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to mis@@ s at least the next four Eng@@ land games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer 's European Championship is clearly uncer@@ tain .
the great sha@@ me of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate an@@ k@@ le injur@@ y and then lo@@ oked back to his old shar@@ p@@ ness during pre @ - @ season .
" this kind of injur@@ y is not career @ - @ threat@@ ening , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
it is a b@@ one that did not he@@ al well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an acci@@ dent .
it was not linked with his an@@ k@@ les or with the injur@@ ies he had before .
that might be true from a pu@@ rely medical perspective but , as W@@ en@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injur@@ ies wh@@ en@@ ever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
there is also an un@@ com@@ for@@ table pat@@ tern developing .
research by Pre@@ mi@@ er injur@@ ies L@@ t@@ d recor@@ ds 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his de@@ but six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ al 's 15@@ 7 le@@ ague games during the last five se@@ as@@ ons .
the wi@@ der picture for Ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six out of eight se@@ as@@ ons since 2007 @ - @ 08 , they have been one of the two Pre@@ mi@@ er League clu@@ bs to lose most days through injur@@ y .
W@@ en@@ ger accep@@ ts the potential of a vic@@ ious circ@@ le but Ar@@ sen@@ al believe that an improvement in their injur@@ y record during last season will continue .
" sometimes , when you are coming back from an injur@@ y , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
J@@ ack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he de@@ serves .
with Ar@@ sen@@ al beginning their Cha@@ mp@@ ions League campaign on Wednesday night against Din@@ am@@ o Zagreb ahead of mat@@ ches with C@@ hel@@ sea on Saturday and T@@ ot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur next Wednesday , W@@ en@@ ger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bel@@ ler@@ í@@ n and A@@ ar@@ on Ram@@ se@@ y have not travel@@ led to Croatia , mean@@ ing M@@ ath@@ i@@ e@@ u De@@ bu@@ ch@@ y and Ar@@ te@@ ta are likely to start .
W@@ en@@ ger may also begin with Ki@@ er@@ an G@@ ib@@ bs and Oli@@ vi@@ er Gi@@ ro@@ ud in place of N@@ ach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
" I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
although Ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favour@@ i@@ tes to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir st@@ adi@@ um in Zagreb is among Europe 's most inti@@ mid@@ ating .
Din@@ am@@ o are also un@@ be@@ aten in 41 mat@@ ches after produc@@ ing their own " inv@@ inci@@ ble " campaign last season .
the st@@ adi@@ um was shak@@ en on Tuesday night by an ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ or that meas@@ ured 3.@@ 2 on the Ric@@ hter .
it was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
W@@ en@@ ger believes that Ar@@ sen@@ al have lear@@ n@@ t the les@@ son of last season 's Cha@@ mp@@ ions League cap@@ it@@ ulation against Mon@@ ac@@ o and remains dri@@ ven by the dist@@ ant hope of man@@ aging the club to a first European Cup tri@@ ump@@ h .
" this drive is im@@ men@@ se , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
it has never been done at Ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are am@@ biti@@ ous but we are not D@@ re@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est : the co@@ me@@ dy show that ta@@ ught us serious les@@ sons about mal@@ e friend@@ ship
the ab@@ s@@ ence of similar por@@ tr@@ ay@@ als in shows is g@@ lar@@ ing , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desp@@ er@@ ate now than ever , with suic@@ ide rates am@@ ong@@ st young mal@@ es at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20 @ - @ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in mal@@ es than fem@@ al@@ es .
in a bid to address the problem , the C@@ amp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Li@@ ving mis@@ er@@ ably ( calm ) announced 2015 as the Year of the Mal@@ e , a@@ iming to challenge the culture that preven@@ ts men from seeking help when they need it .
friend@@ ship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @ - @ school students dis@@ playing de@@ pres@@ sive sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms found that if the suffer@@ er had a high enough percentage of " health@@ y mo@@ od " friends , their chances of recover@@ ing doub@@ led .
equ@@ ally , for those not de@@ pres@@ sed , a circ@@ le of ment@@ ally health@@ y friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges ar@@ ising .
but of course , for friend@@ ship to work , it needs to be ac@@ ces@@ sible in the first place .
in this age of social @ - @ media led communication , with its focus on st@@ yle over sub@@ stance , immedi@@ acy of response is often pri@@ or@@ iti@@ sed over mean@@ ing@@ ful contact .
our digital lives have doub@@ led the need to appear strong , f@@ un @ - @ lov@@ ing and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this super@@ fic@@ ial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists term ex@@ tr@@ in@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expen@@ se of in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic values - our in@@ ner ye@@ ar@@ ning for personal growth and friend@@ ship - that more deep@@ ly imp@@ acts our mental health .
and as a bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire video @ - @ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really doesn ' t buy greater happ@@ iness .
the be@@ a@@ uty of Fri@@ ends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the charac@@ ters were not defined by their work , but rather their person@@ alities , which sh@@ one through the inter@@ action as friends .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler 's frequ@@ ent h@@ ug@@ s , mom@@ ents wat@@ ching football on the com@@ fy chair@@ s , and Ros@@ s 's p@@ ining for R@@ ach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all rela@@ te to this , even if they often hold back from fully expl@@ oring their feel@@ ings .
as a Samar@@ itan wor@@ ker explained to me : .@@ ... " my l@@ ist@@ ening role to people feel@@ ing de@@ pres@@ sed and suic@@ id@@ al has really highlighted how even the smal@@ le@@ st inter@@ actions from friends can make a difference . "
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old ada@@ ge of " getting on with it " is strong , as is the sense that it will be perce@@ ived as weak to open up about problems . "
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long @ - @ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it highlighted the little mom@@ ents of mal@@ e friend@@ ship .
as much as my objective , out@@ si@@ der status over the phone hel@@ ps people in mom@@ ents of desp@@ er@@ ation , the long @ - @ term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend Co@@ me@@ dy Central 's Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebr@@ ation , why not take your friends for a dr@@ ink at Central per@@ k .
or , better still , if in Star@@ bu@@ cks you see someone alone , give a sm@@ ile and say hel@@ lo .
you never know what difference your friend@@ ship could make .
friends is broadcas@@ ting on Co@@ me@@ dy Central from start to finish - the full 2@@ 36 ep@@ iso@@ des - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est
di Maria scores to help P@@ S@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria celebra@@ tes with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and E@@ din@@ son Cav@@ ani after s@@ cor@@ ing against Mal@@ mo .
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria scored on his Cha@@ mp@@ ions League de@@ but to help P@@ S@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
here 's the match report and reaction to the game .
An@@ gel D@@ i Maria and E@@ din@@ son Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris S@@ ain@@ t @ - @ Ger@@ main began their Cha@@ mp@@ ions League campaign with an ulti@@ mately com@@ for@@ table 2 @ - @ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Par@@ c des Pr@@ inc@@ es on Tuesday .
di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Cha@@ mp@@ ions League de@@ but as a P@@ S@@ G player to set the French champ@@ ions on their way , but they mis@@ sed a suc@@ cession of opportunities before finally exten@@ ding their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Re@@ al Madrid and S@@ hak@@ h@@ tar Don@@ et@@ s@@ k also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champ@@ ions as they target not just qual@@ ification for the kno@@ ck@@ out roun@@ ds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter @ - @ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a v@@ in@@ t@@ age display by La@@ ur@@ ent B@@ lan@@ c 's side with Z@@ la@@ tan I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic was@@ te@@ ful in front of goal and later being sub@@ stitu@@ ted against his home@@ town team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
" it 's not easy to win at home or away in the Cha@@ mp@@ ions League , so to win 2 @ - @ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look com@@ for@@ table at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to per@@ f@@ ect as the season goes on , " said B@@ lan@@ c .
it a@@ ug@@ urs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although I regre@@ t that we did not score one or two goals more .
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after injur@@ y in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2 @ - @ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x in L@@ ig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by D@@ i Maria .
the Ar@@ gen@@ t@@ ina w@@ inger was la@@ bel@@ led as the man to take P@@ S@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Man@@ ches@@ ter United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Mar@@ co Ver@@ r@@ at@@ ti 's pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before an@@ g@@ ling a be@@ auti@@ ful finish past Jo@@ han Wil@@ and and into the far cor@@ ner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected P@@ S@@ G to ro@@ m@@ p to a big victory , they were to be dis@@ appointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat C@@ el@@ tic in a play @ - @ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internation@@ als on the field at kic@@ k @ - @ off and , with a five @ - @ man defence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
but , save for a Nikola Djur@@ djic shot that sli@@ d just wide of K@@ ev@@ in T@@ rap@@ p 's far post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , P@@ S@@ G let themselves down at times with some was@@ te@@ ful passing and poor fin@@ ishing , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who failed to con@@ ver@@ t no fe@@ wer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his tou@@ ch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the re@@ start .
nevertheless , he proved much more ade@@ pt when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic pass that D@@ i Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ayan head@@ ing home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had f@@ lic@@ ked on a left @ - @ wing cross from Max@@ well .
that ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a super@@ b stop by Wil@@ and from point @ - @ b@@ lan@@ k range to den@@ y David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before sub@@ stitute E@@ z@@ equ@@ i@@ el L@@ av@@ ez@@ zi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach A@@ ge H@@ are@@ ide later admitted P@@ S@@ G were a class above his side , the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an saying : " our last Cha@@ mp@@ ions League game was in December last year . "
since then we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague which is not the same level .
the quali@@ fi@@ ers are not enough .

it was a ma@@ g@@ nific@@ ent match from them .
G@@ len@@ core ra@@ ises $ 2.5 billion in share sales

London @ - @ listed G@@ len@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 per@@ cent of its market value this year , is grap@@ pl@@ ing with t@@ umb@@ ling commo@@ di@@ ty prices as China 's economic slow@@ down weigh@@ s on demand and spar@@ ks ha@@ vo@@ c across markets .

shares jum@@ ped 2.@@ 77 per@@ cent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the F@@ T@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 per@@ cent higher .
G@@ len@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.5 @ - @ billion shares sale as part of bro@@ ader plans to s@@ las@@ h its $ 30 billion debt p@@ ile by about a third .
the company sold the new stock at 1@@ 25 P@@ ence per share , which marked a 2.@@ 4 @ - @ per@@ cent dis@@ count to the closing price on Tuesday .
it off@@ lo@@ aded 1.@@ 3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 per@@ cent of the group .
concerns over prol@@ on@@ ged stal@@ led Chinese growth have s@@ las@@ hed ir@@ on ore prices by roug@@ h@@ ly a half , as co@@ al , cop@@ per and other commo@@ di@@ ties have fal@@ len by 20 to 40 per@@ cent .

D@@ am@@ on 's comments come at a time where ac@@ cur@@ ate rac@@ ial representation in media is at the fo@@ ref@@ ront of social discussion .
after teen Michael Bro@@ wn was killed by a wh@@ ite police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement took nation@@ wide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discrimin@@ atory practices against people of col@@ or .
in February , singer Pr@@ ince al@@ lu@@ ded to the movement while intro@@ ducing the nomin@@ ees of Al@@ bu@@ m of the Year at the G@@ ram@@ my A@@ wards .
" al@@ b@@ ums still matter , " he said .

pro @ - @ rock cli@@ m@@ ber and b@@ us@@ bo@@ y I@@ sa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o became the first athle@@ te to win American N@@ in@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million gr@@ and prize .
the competition show , which just wrapped up its 7th season , has never seen any competi@@ tor complete all st@@ ages of its obstacle course .
during the season fin@@ ale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o and cam@@ er@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved cli@@ m@@ bing a 75 @ - @ fo@@ ot ro@@ pe in 30 secon@@ ds .
Brit@@ ten went first comple@@ ting the challenge on time , making him the first @ - @ ever athle@@ te to complete American N@@ in@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or 's gru@@ el@@ ing stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o finished the challenge a full three secon@@ ds fas@@ ter making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o spoke with E ! news after the hard @ - @ f@@ ought victory , still in sho@@ ck about winning the $ 1 million gr@@ and prize .
" I mean it 's amaz@@ ing to think about , like I 've never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , " I@@ sa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pay @ - @ b@@ um@@ p .
so to all of a su@@ d@@ den ... like I can ' t even ima@@ g@@ ine what it 's going to be like ... the future is un@@ known .
executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hol@@ ly@@ wood Repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ ale and why , despite Brit@@ ten being the first ever competi@@ tor to finish the course , won ' t be awarded any prize money .
by the rules , the money goes to the fas@@ test person .
" if there 's more than one fin@@ is@@ her , the one with the fas@@ test time gets it , " said We@@ ed .
as much as the money is a won@@ der@@ ful prize and life changing , he does get the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don ' t think he har@@ b@@ ors any ill will about it .
he 's just so happy to have done what he 's done .

D@@ et@@ ro@@ it Ti@@ gers ti@@ p@@ to@@ e past Min@@ nes@@ ot@@ a T@@ wins
Min@@ ne@@ ap@@ ol@@ is -- The second half the season has@@ n ' t been a lot of f@@ un for the D@@ et@@ ro@@ it Ti@@ gers .
once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , the Ti@@ gers are now in last place in the American League Central .
reducing to being a sp@@ o@@ iler , the Ti@@ gers played the part per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly Tuesday , be@@ ating the Min@@ nes@@ ot@@ a T@@ wins 5 @ - @ 4 at Tar@@ get Fi@@ eld .
the T@@ wins squ@@ an@@ dered a chance to cli@@ m@@ b to within one @ - @ half game of the H@@ ou@@ st@@ on A@@ st@@ ros for the second American League w@@ ild @ - @ card sp@@ ot .
for D@@ et@@ ro@@ it , if only for one night , it was a return of the three @ - @ letter F @ - @ word that has been so el@@ u@@ sive over much of the season 's second half .
" all wins are f@@ un , no matter how it happen@@ s , " Ti@@ gers manager Bra@@ d A@@ us@@ mu@@ s said .
Ti@@ gers p@@ it@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Sim@@ on made his early offen@@ sive support hold up , as D@@ et@@ ro@@ it scored three times in the first two in@@ nings , then tac@@ ked one in the sixth and one more in the n@@ in@@ th .
Sim@@ on ( 13 @ - @ 9 ) p@@ it@@ ched 6 1 / 3 in@@ nings and allowed three runs .
it was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
" I just want to finish strong this year , " Sim@@ on said .
it 's hard for the bul@@ l@@ p@@ en to th@@ row every game , and that 's why I want to go deep into the game .
Ti@@ gers design@@ ated hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ in@@ ez had three h@@ its and dro@@ ve in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @ - @ August .
it was Mart@@ in@@ ez 's first three @ - @ hit night since he had four h@@ its against the Se@@ att@@ le mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6 .
" he sw@@ un@@ g the bat well , " A@@ us@@ mu@@ s said .
he lo@@ oked good in ( bat@@ ting practice ) , lo@@ oked no@@ ti@@ ce@@ ably better in B@@ P , and he carried it right into the game .
tra@@ iling by three runs in the bot@@ tom of the se@@ ven@@ th in@@ ning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
C@@ enter fi@@ el@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton led off the in@@ ning with a double down the left field line .
right fi@@ el@@ der A@@ ar@@ on H@@ ic@@ ks reached on a bun@@ t single , and Sim@@ on got second bas@@ em@@ an Bri@@ an Do@@ z@@ ier to strike out sw@@ inging before being lif@@ ted for left @ - @ han@@ der Bla@@ ine har@@ dy .
har@@ dy w@@ alk@@ ed M@@ au@@ er , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ ok@@ ie design@@ ated hit@@ ter M@@ ig@@ uel San@@ o , who ri@@ pped a two @ - @ run single to left off right @ - @ han@@ der D@@ re@@ w Ver@@ ha@@ gen .
with a p@@ air of run@@ ners on and the t@@ ying run at second , Ver@@ ha@@ gen got third bas@@ em@@ an T@@ rev@@ or P@@ l@@ ou@@ ff@@ e to ground into a double play .
it was the major @ - @ le@@ ague @ - @ leading 27th time this season that P@@ l@@ ou@@ ff@@ e hit into a DP .
after D@@ et@@ ro@@ it tac@@ ked on an insurance run in the top of the n@@ in@@ th , M@@ au@@ er ri@@ pped an R@@ B@@ I double to the gap against Ti@@ gers closer B@@ ru@@ ce R@@ on@@ don to make it 5 @ - @ 4 .
however , the right @ - @ han@@ der stru@@ ck out San@@ o on three p@@ it@@ ches for his fifth save .
D@@ et@@ ro@@ it took advantage of a ru@@ st@@ y P@@ hil H@@ ug@@ hes in the early going .
the Ti@@ gers pos@@ ted three runs in the first two in@@ nings against the veteran right @ - @ han@@ der , who came off the dis@@ ab@@ led list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inf@@ lam@@ mation .
" obvi@@ ously not the start I '@@ d like to have , " H@@ ug@@ hes said , " but I felt more com@@ for@@ table as I went along and felt I was able to ex@@ ec@@ ute some pre@@ t@@ ty good p@@ it@@ ches there in the third in@@ ning . "
after getting the lead@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ us@@ hes gave up a single to second bas@@ em@@ an I@@ an K@@ ins@@ ler .
a two @ - @ out wal@@ k to right fi@@ el@@ der J@@ . D@@ . Mart@@ in@@ ez brought up Victor Mart@@ in@@ ez , who sing@@ led up the middle for the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ in@@ ez sn@@ ap@@ ped his 0 @ - @ for @ - @ 21 stre@@ ak with run@@ ners in s@@ cor@@ ing position .
third bas@@ em@@ an Nic@@ k Cas@@ tel@@ lan@@ os followed with a single to right , s@@ cor@@ ing another run , but Victor Mart@@ in@@ ez was thro@@ wn out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
the Ti@@ gers added on in the second , getting a one @ - @ out double from cat@@ cher James Mc@@ Can@@ n and a two @ - @ out single by cen@@ ter fi@@ el@@ der An@@ th@@ ony G@@ ose to make it 3 @ - @ 0 .
" that was a big hit , " T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or said .
he didn ' t hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right sp@@ ot .
H@@ ug@@ hes , who was on a p@@ it@@ ch count , p@@ it@@ ched a sco@@ re@@ less third in@@ ning before being replaced by right @ - @ handed reli@@ ever A@@ . J@@ . A@@ ch@@ ter .
H@@ ug@@ hes was charged with three runs on six h@@ its and a wal@@ k with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Ti@@ gers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ b@@ al San@@ che@@ z was shut down with a stra@@ in in his thro@@ wing sho@@ ul@@ der .
he will be exam@@ ined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed sur@@ ger@@ y on San@@ che@@ z 's sho@@ ul@@ der back in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the dis@@ ab@@ led list with a sho@@ ul@@ der stra@@ in since mid @ - @ August , was scheduled to be activ@@ ated for a Wednesday start .

X@@ i urges to open economy wi@@ der to world
the economy must open wi@@ der to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping told a group t@@ asked with ste@@ ering reform on Tuesday .
" China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and exper@@ ti@@ se , and improve opening @ - @ up policies , " he said , addressing the 16th Me@@ et@@ ing of the Central Le@@ ad@@ ing Group for dee@@ pen@@ ing O@@ ver@@ all Reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will ad@@ d new imp@@ et@@ us and v@@ it@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leading group adopted a series of gu@@ ide@@ lines including a negative list regula@@ ting market access , rela@@ x@@ ation of border @ - @ control policies , encouraging state @ - @ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absor@@ b private capital and overha@@ ul@@ ing the resident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identi@@ f@@ ying sectors and businesses that are off @ - @ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradu@@ ally tes@@ ted and improved through trial progra@@ ms .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in al@@ loc@@ ating resources , ensuring a law @ - @ based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also lo@@ osen contr@@ ols on the powers it deleg@@ ates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said China will allow border areas to expl@@ ore new mode@@ ls of cross @ - @ border economic co@@ operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state @ - @ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
" the government will not change its policy to@@ ward foreign investment , and will protect the law@@ ful interests of foreign @ - @ funded companies and provide better services for them , " said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent resi@@ dence per@@ mits , or " green card , " by opti@@ m@@ iz@@ ing requirements and stre@@ am@@ lining the application process .
guarante@@ eing lawyers ' right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by Pre@@ mi@@ er L@@ i Ke@@ q@@ i@@ an@@ g , and senior leaders Li@@ u Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ han@@ g Ga@@ ol@@ i , according to a statement released after the meeting .
mini @ - @ b@@ ag@@ s are the he@@ ight of fas@@ hion - Zaman New@@ sp@@ aper Saturday S@@ up@@ ple@@ ment
the subject eventually returned to b@@ ag@@ s in the world of fas@@ hion .
the recent outstanding trend is those min@@ i@@ atures ...
it is possible to say that the small b@@ ag@@ s that are placed next to the big ones draw attention .
it is said that small is be@@ auti@@ ful .
this point of view also app@@ lies to b@@ ag@@ s .
even though we didn ' t tire of w@@ alk@@ ing the streets with almost @ - @ su@@ it@@ case @ - @ siz@@ ed b@@ ag@@ s , the ti@@ de has started to turn and b@@ ag@@ s are inc@@ lined to be smaller .
small b@@ ag@@ s already ex@@ isted but they appeared before us in min@@ im@@ ised ver@@ sions of big sho@@ ul@@ der b@@ ag@@ s .
only your telephone , credit card and ke@@ ys f@@ it inside these tin@@ y b@@ ag@@ s .
starting with C@@ é@@ line and Her@@ m@@ è@@ s , the trend spread with Pra@@ da .
trans@@ forming this ba@@ g man@@ ia into an interest for mini @ - @ b@@ ag@@ s has affected the newly emerging mode@@ ls .
Lo@@ e@@ we presented the f@@ un b@@ ag@@ s it created in two siz@@ es .
among the b@@ ag@@ s , in the shap@@ e of pan@@ da@@ s , po@@ lar be@@ ars and ele@@ phan@@ ts , the most outstanding ones are the ele@@ ph@@ ant @ - @ shap@@ ed ones .
presented by lu@@ x@@ ury br@@ ands with phenom@@ en@@ al names , mini ver@@ sions of the big b@@ ag@@ s seem to attract red @ - @ car@@ p@@ et cele@@ bri@@ ties most .
one of the most popular is the " Bir@@ kin " ba@@ g Her@@ m@@ è@@ s created as a de@@ dic@@ ation to Jan@@ e Bir@@ kin .
even though Jan@@ e Bir@@ kin said that she does not want her name to be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed with a ba@@ g , she is now im@@ prin@@ ted in the mem@@ ory in this way .
fas@@ hion weeks led to the popular@@ iz@@ ation of the mini @ - @ ba@@ g trend .
consequ@@ ently , mini @ - @ b@@ ag@@ s have been prominent on the po@@ di@@ um .
since they are very small , it is not really possible to we@@ ar them on your ar@@ m .
they can be wor@@ n across the body with their long st@@ rap@@ s .
however , we saw these st@@ rap@@ s tan@@ g@@ led around the w@@ rist@@ s of the mode@@ ls on the po@@ di@@ um .
F@@ en@@ di is one of those taking the mini @ - @ ba@@ g th@@ eme one step forward .
it has some ad@@ vice for those who can not f@@ it into mini @ - @ b@@ ag@@ s but can not aband@@ on them either .
mini @ - @ b@@ ag@@ s as a friend of big b@@ ag@@ s .
how ?
by trans@@ forming the mini @ - @ b@@ ag@@ s into a ba@@ g or@@ nament that can be attac@@ hed to bigger ones .
featured on the po@@ di@@ ums , this present@@ ation has taken to the streets very quickly .
let 's see what else we will see !
Den@@ im changes s@@ kin
Turkey is on a level that can compete with world br@@ ands in terms of den@@ im .
the experience gained in production has been en@@ ri@@ ched with de@@ sign .
L@@ oft is one of them .
we now see that black design@@ s , having been few in the past , take their place on the shel@@ ves every season .
Den@@ im found its clos@@ est friend in a season when black c@@ olo@@ urs are on the rise .
le@@ ather pi@@ ec@@ es and design@@ s with le@@ ather details come to the fo@@ ref@@ ront as the rebel@@ li@@ ous friend of den@@ im .
generally , z@@ ip@@ per@@ ed short design@@ s called " motor@@ bi@@ ke " are most prominent .
the strong mo@@ od of le@@ ather complete with black pi@@ ec@@ es ; chi@@ ff@@ on long blo@@ uses and b@@ right swe@@ at@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , provides a cas@@ ual and chi@@ c appearance .
in the past , young people wor@@ e den@@ im and wanted to be lost in the crowd .
it was thought that it would save the day .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , young people want to we@@ ar design@@ s that are com@@ for@@ table and emphas@@ ise their st@@ yle at the same time .
within this perspective , it can be said that L@@ oft correc@@ tly under@@ stood its target group with their collec@@ tions and ac@@ ces@@ sor@@ ies it designed
a small step for Ban@@ k@@ sy , a giant step for the " Global "
bringing together the works of my@@ ster@@ ious street artist Ban@@ k@@ sy , the world premi@@ è@@ re of the collection " The Art of Ban@@ k@@ sy " was held in Istanbul .
a product of 15 years of work from the artist and gather@@ ing the origin@@ als of 85 works for the first time , the exhibition is the first in the Global Kar@@ ak@@ ö@@ y building .
the first exhibition by the my@@ ster@@ ious street artist Ban@@ k@@ sy in Istanbul opened y@@ es@@ ter@@ day in the Global Kar@@ ak@@ ö@@ y ( R@@ ı@@ h@@ t@@ ım Street ) .
the world famous artist , who conce@@ als his identity and uses an ali@@ as , was not present at the exhibition opening of course .
we also don ' t know if he came to Istanbul or not .
however , Ban@@ k@@ sy is not aware of this exhibition according to Ste@@ ve Lazar@@ i@@ da@@ s , cur@@ ator of the exhibition .
it is not necessary to receive per@@ mission from him .
the reason is that old friends Ban@@ k@@ sy and Lazar@@ i@@ da@@ s par@@ ted company with each other after 12 years .
the exhibi@@ ted works were part@@ ly collected from Lazar@@ i@@ da@@ s and collec@@ tors .
however , there are issues that Ban@@ k@@ sy fans are cur@@ ious about .
what would Ban@@ k@@ sy think about the exhibition " The Art of Ban@@ k@@ sy " which brings together 85 of his works ?
for example , what would he think of entering the exhibition with a tic@@ ket ( 35 T@@ L ) ? what would he say if he saw the 800 square metre gal@@ lery space with a small st@@ ore created at the end ?
would he raise his voice against the fact that cl@@ ot@@ h b@@ ag@@ s , w@@ alle@@ ts and nec@@ k@@ la@@ ces are prin@@ ted with works of his such as Red bal@@ lo@@ on G@@ ir@@ l , ma@@ id , sm@@ ile No@@ w , which dra@@ ws attention to the wo@@ unds of the world ?
Ban@@ k@@ sy follow@@ ers feel dis@@ appointed by the turning of an exhibition of an artist who conce@@ als his identity and has an an@@ arch@@ ist sou@@ l into such consu@@ mer goods .
this is certainly not the st@@ yle of Ban@@ k@@ sy .
nevertheless , get your limited avail@@ ability tic@@ kets before they are sold out !
small for Ban@@ k@@ sy but giant for the g@@ lob@@ alised world , the exhibition " The Art of Ban@@ k@@ sy " can be seen until April .
they are desp@@ ic@@ able and cru@@ el .
let them di@@ g di@@ t@@ ches .
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continued his reaction against the academ@@ ics that signed the declaration .
Erdoğan said , " T@@ hey are cru@@ el , they are desp@@ ic@@ able . "
because those who stand by the op@@ pres@@ sors are op@@ pres@@ sors .
he said , " S@@ ince they stand by those who sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered , they committed the same off@@ ence . "
lay@@ ing f@@ low@@ ers at the scene of the explos@@ ion in Sul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said , " I shared our gri@@ ef both with the German President and German Chancellor because of the fact that 10 of our German friends were killed during this action in Sul@@ tan@@ ah@@ met S@@ qu@@ are that is full of history and civil@@ iz@@ ation , and simply a square of peace - particularly in a place like this , near to the German Foun@@ tain . "
fir@@ st@@ ly I would like to conv@@ ey my con@@ dol@@ ences to the German people , especially to the families of the victims .
he said , " O@@ ur fight against terrorism will continue with determination . "
continuing his reaction towards the academ@@ ics who signed the declaration , Erdoğan stated the following : " I condem@@ n again and strongly condem@@ n in particular the academ@@ ics who put their sign@@ ature under this sla@@ ughter by publis@@ hing a " p@@ it@@ ch @ - @ black " declaration even in the face of all these terrorist incidents . "
I want our nation to understand much more closely who is who ; in other words , having a title of professor , ass@@ istant professor does not make a person liter@@ ate .
they are completely dar@@ k people .
they are cru@@ el , they are desp@@ ic@@ able .
since they stand by those who sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered , they also committed the same off@@ ence .
what do these dar@@ k academ@@ ics think about those ba@@ bi@@ es , 3 @ - @ year old Mev@@ lü@@ de who died a m@@ art@@ y@@ r with her father in the incident that occurred in Ç@@ ın@@ ar ?
how can they allow their con@@ science to stand by her kil@@ lers ?
I am inv@@ iting all the judicial authorities , university sen@@ ates to do their duty for these acts against our constitution and laws .
y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , I said that all the necessary steps should be taken rap@@ id@@ ly .
let them do whatever they do out there .
if they want to do politics , let them do politics in parliament .
if they can not do it in parliament , let them go and di@@ g di@@ t@@ ches or go to the moun@@ tains .

C@@ eline D@@ ion lost her hus@@ band
Ren@@ é An@@ g@@ é@@ li@@ l , the hus@@ band of Can@@ adi@@ an singer C@@ eline D@@ ion , has passed away .
An@@ g@@ é@@ li@@ l discovered the tal@@ ent of D@@ ion when she was 12 years old , and the couple got mar@@ ried in 1994 in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
after An@@ g@@ é@@ li@@ l was di@@ agnos@@ ed with cancer in 1999 , C@@ eline D@@ ion took a break from her career .
" while I was sear@@ ching for two w@@ rest@@ ler children , I found 26 people "
the second docum@@ entary from M@@ ete G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han , " Y@@ oun@@ g W@@ rest@@ ler , " 6@@ 6th .
it became the first Turkish docum@@ entary to be selected in the " Gener@@ ation K@@ plus " section of the Berlin Film Festival ( February 11 @ - @ 21 ) .
originally from E@@ dir@@ ne but with a production company in the Netherlands , G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han talk@@ ed about how and why he shot the docum@@ entary which he completed in the summer of 2014 .
telling the story of six students in a bo@@ ar@@ ding school from A@@ mas@@ ya who aimed at becoming the world champion in the field of w@@ rest@@ ling , the docum@@ entary " Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ rest@@ lers " will compete in the " Gener@@ ation K@@ plus " section of the Berlin Film Festival .
being the first made @ - @ in @ - @ Turkey docum@@ entary to be selected in this section , Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ rest@@ lers is one of the candidates for the Cr@@ y@@ st@@ al Be@@ ar award .
M@@ ete G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han is originally from E@@ dir@@ ne even though he was born and raised in the Netherlands .
he l@@ ist@@ ened to st@@ ories about gre@@ ase w@@ rest@@ ling from his gr@@ and@@ father and wat@@ ched competi@@ tions in Turkey , where he came during the summer when he was a child .
" there are not only political problems in Turkey . "
I wanted to tell the world what is going on in Anatol@@ ia other than that .
with the idea , " w@@ rest@@ ling , one of our an@@ ces@@ tor sports , is not well known , " for example , he brought together 6 directors and wanted to create a docum@@ entary project .
this project remained in@@ conclu@@ sive but news in a magazine he read on a plan@@ e opened the door to another project for G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han .
" we st@@ ay@@ ed in a su@@ gar factory "
trac@@ ing the article that talk@@ ed about two little w@@ rest@@ ler bro@@ thers aged 10 @ - @ 11 , M@@ ete G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han went so Sam@@ sun , where their family lives .
the father of the children did not give per@@ mission to sho@@ ot a docum@@ entary .
G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han talk@@ ed about how he over@@ came this challenge as follows : " I thought about what I could do all day long . "
" because the support of the Ministry of Culture might be withdra@@ wn . "
the father mentioned a bo@@ ar@@ ding school in A@@ mas@@ ya , where the children would go .
I thought of going there .
while I was sear@@ ching for two children , I found 26 children with an interest in w@@ rest@@ ling .
we started shooting preparations and final@@ ized the author@@ iz@@ ation .
we did not even have a place to stay .
" we st@@ ay@@ ed in the d@@ or@@ mit@@ ory of a su@@ gar factory . "
language was the biggest challenge posed for the director by the docum@@ entary , the shooting of which was completed in 3 weeks .
stat@@ ing that three different languages were spok@@ en on the set of the film in which a foreign director of cin@@ e@@ ma@@ to@@ graphy and a so@@ un@@ d@@ man worked , G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han said , " I did not know what I would come across during the sho@@ ot . "
he says , " T@@ hey did not know Turkish either . "
young w@@ rest@@ lers focus@@ es on the story of six of the 26 child w@@ rest@@ lers .
Baran , who was brought up by his gr@@ and@@ father and had a we@@ ight problem , Har@@ un , who could not participate in training because he broke his ar@@ m , Bey@@ tul@@ lah , who is am@@ biti@@ ous but has some health problems , Ü@@ mit , who is the pre@@ t@@ ty bo@@ y of the school , the youn@@ gest champion Ahmet and Mu@@ ham@@ med , who holds the group together ...
M@@ ete G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han says of working with the children as follows : " I let them be completely natural . "
I tried to use only Mu@@ ham@@ med every@@ where .
I shot the training for the first one and a half weeks .
I wanted that the children act as if there were no cam@@ era .
" F@@ ort@@ un@@ ately they quickly adap@@ ted . "
it was a surprise to be selected for Berlin
stat@@ ing that he did not expect Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ rest@@ lers to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival , M@@ ete G@@ üm@@ ür@@ han said , " We were ready , but it was a surprise for us to be selected for Berlin . "
young w@@ rest@@ lers is not a sports docum@@ entary , it is a production that nar@@ rates the struggle of the children and a sli@@ ce of their life .
he says , " I wanted to high@@ light the struggle of children with family problems to find an identity and their story of cop@@ ing with their problems . "
support from the world of art for the academ@@ ics
the stor@@ m that broke out after the declaration of " The Initiative of academ@@ ics for Peace , " went so far that investigations were opened against the academ@@ ics and they were taken into custody y@@ es@@ ter@@ day ; but at the same time , there are also statements of support arri@@ ving one after another .
the first support came from the liter@@ ati , among whom there are many famous people .
film makers expressed their support the day before y@@ es@@ ter@@ day , and theatre actors did so y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
in the ex@@ plan@@ ation made with the sign@@ atures of 13@@ 8 theatre actors , it was stated , " We , as artists working in the field of theatre and stage @ - @ performance , stand by this hon@@ our@@ able meeting of academ@@ ics making a call for peace ; and we state that we stand by the freedom of expression , equality , right to life and un@@ condi@@ tional peace . "
it was said , " We ad@@ d our voice to the discussion and peace calls from the academ@@ ics with all our heart and con@@ science . "
more than 400 film makers including Deniz Tür@@ kal@@ i , A@@ til@@ la Öz@@ dem@@ i@@ ro@@ ğlu , N@@ adi@@ r Sar@@ ı@@ b@@ acak , Öz@@ can Al@@ per , Ser@@ ra Yıl@@ maz , On@@ ur Ü@@ n@@ lü , Y@@ eş@@ im U@@ sta@@ oğlu , P@@ elin Es@@ mer , Tol@@ ga Kar@@ aç@@ elik stated that , " We stand by free thought and art . "
without using but , however and if : " we won ' t take part in this crime ! "
they supported the academ@@ ics by saying , " We stand by the Initiative of the academ@@ ics for Peace . "
the S@@ cre@@ en@@ writ@@ ers Association ( S@@ İ@@ Y@@ AD ) also made a statement and said , " We stand by the academ@@ ics , who were made the target of a ly@@ n@@ ching campaign . "
the Initiative of academ@@ ics for Peace called for peace and discussion from the government with si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ous statements in Ankara and Istanbul on January 11 ; and it published a declaration under the title , " We are not party to this crime . "
in addition to the 11@@ 28 academ@@ ics from 8@@ 9 universities , the text was signed by thin@@ kers such as No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y , David Har@@ v@@ ey , Im@@ man@@ uel Wal@@ ler@@ ste@@ in , Ju@@ di@@ th But@@ ler , and E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne B@@ ali@@ bar , who have worldwide f@@ ame through their the@@ ories and books .
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoğlu defined the declaration of the academ@@ ics as " support for terrorism " and criticised it very har@@ sh@@ ly ; and Erdoğan called on organiz@@ ations to " do what is needed . "
after this call , some universities fired the academ@@ ics and the prosecution office brought an e@@ x @ - @ offici@@ o prosecution .
many academ@@ ics were taken into custody y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
I am your f@@ an , ple@@ ase help me !
Hür@@ re@@ m Sul@@ tan 's red ha@@ ir , Ber@@ en 's n@@ ose , J@@ us@@ tin 's ha@@ ir ...
trying to look like cele@@ bri@@ ties is considered normal to some ex@@ tent but it is regar@@ ded as a psych@@ ological dis@@ order after the point that it star@@ ts to completely affect your life .
" celebr@@ ity wor@@ ship syn@@ dro@@ me , " also known as " the syn@@ dro@@ me of wor@@ shi@@ pping famous people " is a matter that has already become an academ@@ ic issue around the world and is a newly spok@@ en about issue in our country .
it can be considered normal to some ex@@ tent that ladi@@ es run to the ha@@ ir sal@@ ons with ph@@ otos of cele@@ bri@@ ties .
however , we should not for@@ get the " Hür@@ re@@ m Sul@@ tan " year when all the youth w@@ alk@@ ed around with red Irish ha@@ ir .
it was already reported that " Ber@@ en 's n@@ ose " led the way in plas@@ tic sur@@ ger@@ ies in 2015 .
the situation is not so very different on the part of men .
once upon a time , d@@ ressing like P@@ ola@@ t A@@ lem@@ dar was a cust@@ om .
now a tot@@ ally different trend prev@@ ail@@ s every@@ where .
our surroun@@ dings are full of young boys that are cop@@ ies of J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber .
it is at such an ex@@ tent that the following quot@@ e of us@@ ele@@ s@@ s information was read thousands of times : " fir@@ st@@ ly , when you go to the ha@@ ir@@ d@@ res@@ ser , have your ha@@ ir cut at the sides , in other words , the part over and around your e@@ ars up to the up@@ per part of your head . "
however , the sides should be short .
after the c@@ utting process is over , you should shap@@ e your ha@@ ir lightly with water .
after the shap@@ ing process , fi@@ x your ha@@ ir with the help of sp@@ ra@@ y .
" it is necessary to shap@@ e it when it is w@@ et to get J@@ us@@ tin ha@@ ir . "
all of these issues have already become academ@@ ic sub@@ j@@ ects around the world , but they re@@ mind us of the newly spok@@ en " celebr@@ ity wor@@ ship syn@@ dro@@ me , " in other words " the syn@@ dro@@ me of wor@@ shi@@ pping famous people . "
fans of cele@@ bri@@ ties are considered as a " bun@@ dle of love . "
artists always pri@@ de themselves on their f@@ an numbers and how their fans affect them .
luc@@ kil@@ y , psych@@ ology does not consider the condition so simply .
in particular , it is much discussed that ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ents make decisions about what they e@@ at and dr@@ ink , what they lis@@ ten to , what they we@@ ar in accordance with cele@@ bri@@ ties .
ex@@ cessive lo@@ yal@@ ty to people presented as un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , and taking them as role mode@@ ls is defined as a mental dis@@ order .
senior psych@@ ologist Sü@@ mey@@ ye Dem@@ ir accep@@ ts that Turkey falls behind in terms of studies into this field .
however she does not fail to no@@ tice the fact that families are gradu@@ ally becoming con@@ sci@@ ous : " one of the basic issues in the science of psych@@ ology is people being at peace with themselves and finding peace in their identi@@ ties . "
in the past , it was not taken seriously if children fil@@ led their ro@@ oms with pos@@ ters and played the role of someone .
this situation is now changing .
their parents feel the need to interven@@ e in the situation .
" pas@@ sion@@ ate lo@@ yal@@ ty to someone is a sign of the fact that something has gone wrong in the teen 's life . "
fans jum@@ ping onto the em@@ o@@ tional speed train
interest in celebr@@ ity is safe in moder@@ ation .
Dem@@ ir advis@@ es to be car@@ eful of sy@@ mp@@ t@@ oms such as not w@@ an@@ ting them to mar@@ ry , en@@ v@@ ying their sp@@ ous@@ es and pre@@ fer@@ ring their c@@ lo@@ thing st@@ y@@ les .
as the name imp@@ lies , we are talking about famous people .
being cur@@ ious about them and having an interest in their life is considered normal to some ex@@ tent .
however , young people over@@ ste@@ pping the limits are pre@@ val@@ ent according to the senior psych@@ ologist : " when there is no one in the family or the surroun@@ dings to serve as a model for virtu@@ es and good behavi@@ our , this gap is certainly fil@@ led . "
good examp@@ les do not always emer@@ ge .
" children also cop@@ y the negative things . "
when we cons@@ ult her about how we should approach them , Sü@@ mey@@ ye Dem@@ ir star@@ ts by remin@@ ding us that the syn@@ dro@@ me of celebr@@ ity wor@@ ship is seen mostly in ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ence .
the problem is more easily overcome once it is taken into consideration that ad@@ o@@ les@@ c@@ ents may be in@@ secure .
on one hand , we are compla@@ ining about the limit@@ ations of family and on the other hand we are facing young people expec@@ ting support and aff@@ ection from them : " we are obli@@ ged to take into consideration their em@@ o@@ tional ups and dow@@ ns . "
new research put forward that they are forced by the changes oc@@ curr@@ ing in their bra@@ ins .
" it should be taken n@@ atur@@ ally if an ad@@ o@@ les@@ cent , jum@@ ping onto the em@@ o@@ tional speed train , is attac@@ hed to someone ; and they should be appro@@ ac@@ hed deli@@ ca@@ tely . "
it is possible to change behavi@@ our
senior psych@@ ologist Sü@@ mey@@ ye Dem@@ ir , remin@@ ds us of the duties fal@@ ling into the share of parents to overcome celebr@@ ity wor@@ ship syn@@ dro@@ me :
identify their em@@ o@@ tional problem and be sure that you are calm before bringing up the issue .
never let them sup@@ press their em@@ o@@ tions .
express your respect for their ad@@ oration in order to encourage freedom .
instead of teac@@ hing them by re@@ pri@@ man@@ ding , serve as a good model for them , discuss the people that can be a role model to them .
try to talk together about the ro@@ les of cele@@ bri@@ ties in our daily life .
it would be hel@@ p@@ ful to read books about the real world of cele@@ bri@@ ties together .
change your communication approach to the form of ad@@ ult to ad@@ ult .
do not for@@ get the fact that addi@@ ction and motiv@@ ation use the bra@@ in in the same way .
tell your child that er@@ r@@ ors are opportunities for change , and accept them as they are .
get the support of speci@@ alists dealing with being a f@@ an .
those who get an@@ gr@@ y and those who ad@@ m@@ ire both wor@@ ship
at the base of the syn@@ dro@@ me of celebr@@ ity wor@@ ship there is a need to appeal and get help from someone .
it is in fact a un@@ prev@@ ent@@ able love , a call for help .
but unfortunately it is not perce@@ ived like this .
furthermore , this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to nar@@ row it down to a country or a contin@@ ent .
Dr. Rec@@ ai Yah@@ y@@ a@@ oğlu dra@@ ws attention to the fact that there are certain people that occup@@ y the television in every country .
the syn@@ dro@@ me man@@ i@@ fes@@ ts itself mostly in an attac@@ hment to the cele@@ bri@@ ties : " they are extra@@ ordinary . "
most people do not have their opportunities .
those who have do not live their life by acting like them .
it is because they do not em@@ br@@ ace this life or they do not d@@ are to do it .
" however , both those who do not have the opportunities , and those who have the opportunities but do not live like them continue to watch them an@@ gr@@ ily . "
there is no difference between those who c@@ ov@@ et them and those who watch them bur@@ st@@ ing with an@@ ger .
both ad@@ m@@ ire them in@@ war@@ dly .
they ear@@ n money without troub@@ le , they are in magaz@@ ines daily .
even kno@@ wing this is enough to increase their ad@@ mir@@ ation .
other ad@@ vice from the senior psych@@ ologist Sü@@ mey@@ ye Dem@@ ir is to question the reality of these lives .
we should not fail to no@@ tice that arti@@ fic@@ ial lives are being talk@@ ed about .
support from the surrounding people steps in for the person who fe@@ els pas@@ sion@@ ately about celebr@@ ity .
however , people insist on rej@@ ecting the fact that the cele@@ bri@@ ties they ad@@ m@@ ire also have problems like them .

should I under@@ go a cho@@ lec@@ y@@ st@@ ost@@ om@@ y ? - F@@ am@@ ily @ - @ Health News - Zaman New@@ sp@@ aper
Dr. F@@ ev@@ zi Öz@@ gön@@ ül ans@@ wers the questions in his col@@ umn in the Mey@@ dan New@@ sp@@ aper . .
I have gal@@ l@@ st@@ ones , I have sto@@ ma@@ ch ac@@ he when I get up every morning and after me@@ als ; and I visit the to@@ il@@ et 2 times or more every@@ day .
could it prevent me from losing we@@ ight ?
I have now started to use alk@@ al@@ ine , but my appe@@ ti@@ te for me@@ als has@@ n ' t di@@ min@@ ished , I can not lose any we@@ ight .
it has been the same since my ch@@ ild@@ hood .
what should I do ?
in your opinion , should I under@@ go a cho@@ lec@@ y@@ st@@ ost@@ om@@ y ?
answer : most of the time , an inf@@ ection ac@@ companies gal@@ l@@ st@@ ones .
this compla@@ int of sto@@ ma@@ ch aches , oc@@ curr@@ ing soon after me@@ als , is a sign of the fact that your gal@@ l@@ bla@@ d@@ der tigh@@ tens when you e@@ at and you sp@@ ill the inf@@ ected g@@ all into the in@@ test@@ ines .
dist@@ ur@@ bed by the inf@@ ected g@@ all , the in@@ test@@ ines try to quickly exp@@ el this g@@ all .
this is why you visit the to@@ il@@ et frequ@@ ently .
since you visit the to@@ il@@ et frequ@@ ently and what you e@@ at is exp@@ elled without being di@@ ges@@ ted , losing we@@ ight becomes s@@ lower .
in my opinion , you should have this condition treated .
if you go to a g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ologist and the condition is de@@ tec@@ ted as I said , you can be free from this condition by using anti@@ bi@@ o@@ tics .
however , you may eventually have to under@@ go a cho@@ lec@@ y@@ st@@ ost@@ om@@ y .
Alkal@@ ine pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tics may decrease your sy@@ mp@@ t@@ ons but it does not c@@ ure them .
I advis@@ e you to use alk@@ al@@ ine pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tics any@@ way .
because this pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tic pow@@ der is the biggest help in losing we@@ ight .
I e@@ at too much under st@@ ress
de@@ ar si@@ r , I e@@ at continu@@ ously when I am stressed and an@@ gr@@ y ; and I gain we@@ ight .
how can I cop@@ e with this ?
answer : an ex@@ cessive appe@@ ti@@ te for food means in fact that your energy needs are not met .
the reason for this may be e@@ ating less or sk@@ ip@@ ping morning me@@ als and l@@ un@@ ches .
another reason is your failure to di@@ gest the food you e@@ at .
to do this , your di@@ ges@@ tive system should work health@@ ily .
if you do not have a problem such as an ul@@ cer , ref@@ lu@@ x or similar problems , the easi@@ est way is to use a good pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tic medicine .
you will gre@@ at@@ ly feel its benefits .
I can not gain we@@ ight , doctors do not know the reason
generally there is information about losing we@@ ight in your col@@ umn .
all of it seems log@@ ical to me too , but my situation is a little bit different .
some@@ how I can not gain we@@ ight .
the most important thing is I do not know why .
doctors do not say anything either .
answer : the tech@@ ni@@ ques we apply are not intended for losing we@@ ight , but also reg@@ ain@@ ing the phy@@ si@@ ological func@@ tions of the body and turning it into its ideal size .
being over@@ we@@ ight and being too th@@ in are the same kin@@ ds of dis@@ order .
failure to lose we@@ ight when f@@ at and failure to gain we@@ ight when s@@ lim are cu@@ red with the same tech@@ ni@@ que .
you lose we@@ ight more when you e@@ at swe@@ ets and pas@@ tries .
I ima@@ g@@ ine you might have under@@ stood this by now .
it is also possible for you to be sti@@ mu@@ lated with Car@@ bo@@ x@@ y ther@@ ap@@ y and gain we@@ ight through a health@@ y di@@ et .
in other words , you became dist@@ ant from your ideal body by losing we@@ ight .
other patients of ours became dist@@ ant from their ideal bodies by putting on we@@ ight .
you will reach your ideal body by gaining we@@ ight , and they will do so by losing we@@ ight .
if the problem with the system is elimin@@ ated , you will gain we@@ ight , they will lose we@@ ight .
nevertheless , fir@@ st@@ ly the system should work proper@@ ly .

children who feel wor@@ th@@ less become st@@ uc@@ k in " hat@@ red "
there are some in@@ n@@ ate em@@ o@@ tions in people 's world of em@@ o@@ tion .
fear , sad@@ ness , happ@@ iness , ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , an@@ ger , an@@ x@@ i@@ ety ...
however , some em@@ o@@ tions like hat@@ red , holding a gru@@ dge and reven@@ ge emer@@ ge in children gradu@@ ally and as a result of the wrong behavi@@ our .
everybody needs to be an individual including during their ch@@ ild@@ hood .
in other words , they desire that their parents and social circ@@ le respect their decisions , their opinion is asked in matters related to them , and they are made to feel valu@@ ed .
enab@@ ling them to create the base on which to construc@@ t a health@@ y person@@ ality .
for example , behavi@@ our such as making decisions in matters rela@@ ting to the child ( what they we@@ ar , what they e@@ at ) instead of the child , insisting on your truth without considering the w@@ is@@ hes of the child ( sending a child to a music course even though they want to go to a football course ) means not respec@@ ting the person@@ ality of the child .
when their individu@@ ality and being are not respected , children lose the freedom of " being themselves " and their defence mechanism reve@@ als em@@ o@@ tions of an@@ ger and hat@@ red in order to protect themselves .
stat@@ ing that , " The reason is that an@@ ger and hat@@ red are in fact just op@@ pos@@ i@@ tes of accep@@ tan@@ ce , " psych@@ ologist Hil@@ al Ar@@ s@@ lan says that children do not accept what is done to them by showing h@@ ate and they try to say to both themselves and the people around them that they are pre@@ ci@@ ous .
saying that it is good for their person@@ ality development that children do not accept the situation and re@@ act to it , the senior psych@@ ologist said , " The hat@@ red here means I am also here , it serves the children 's aim to protect their self @ - @ respect . "
she says , " I@@ f children are allowed to be individuals , the hat@@ red will be elimin@@ ated . "
children try to protect their self by res@@ ort@@ ing to an@@ ger and hat@@ red
saying that if children are ex@@ posed to the ver@@ b@@ al and em@@ o@@ tional violence of their parents and surroun@@ dings , it will cause negative em@@ o@@ tions in children in a time that they are at a young age and are both phy@@ si@@ cally and spir@@ itu@@ ally most vulnerable , Ar@@ s@@ lan states that neg@@ ligence will make the child feel that their existence is not no@@ tic@@ ed and they are in@@ visible .
Ar@@ s@@ lan continues with the following : " may@@ be sometimes we can fail to meet the em@@ o@@ tional needs ( not stro@@ king their ha@@ ir , not h@@ ug@@ ging and k@@ is@@ sing them , not car@@ ing about their school or other needs ) , and sometimes we can fail to meet also their phy@@ sical needs ( e@@ ating , dr@@ in@@ king , shel@@ ter , school needs et@@ c . ) . "
this is a growing attitude that opens the doors to an@@ ger and hat@@ red .
for em@@ o@@ tional and ver@@ b@@ al violence , there is behavi@@ our like hum@@ iliation , ins@@ ul@@ ting , beli@@ t@@ t@@ ling , s@@ col@@ ding , un@@ necessary and heavy pun@@ is@@ hment , making them feel wor@@ th@@ less and yel@@ ling .
since this behavi@@ our is towards the person@@ ality of the child , it has a deep effect .
" children who accept it , lose their self @ - @ respect and spend their lives strugg@@ ling with the feel@@ ing that they are wor@@ th@@ less , un@@ wor@@ th@@ y of being lov@@ ed and in@@ adequate , or they will protect themselves by res@@ ort@@ ing to an@@ ger and hat@@ red . "

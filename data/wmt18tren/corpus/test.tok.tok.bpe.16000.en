jun@@ ior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of jun@@ ior doctors have called on their union to author@@ ise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the Jun@@ ior Do@@ c@@ tors Committee ( J@@ D@@ C ) of the British Medi@@ cal Association ( B@@ M@@ A ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September .
the J@@ D@@ C says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
jun@@ ior doctors and medical students voted in July to rej@@ ect a contract deal agreed with the B@@ M@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the bal@@ lot .
in a letter to members released on T@@ wit@@ ter on Thursday night , the J@@ D@@ C 's cha@@ ir El@@ len Mc@@ Court said the government had remained " per@@ s@@ ist@@ ently sil@@ ent " on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : " in light of this , the J@@ D@@ C Executive has voted to rej@@ ect the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re @ - @ negotiations on all of your concerns . "
in response to the government 's sil@@ ence , J@@ D@@ C ex@@ e@@ c has today made a formal request for a special meeting of B@@ M@@ A Council to author@@ ise a rol@@ ling programme of es@@ cal@@ ated industrial action beginning in early September .
the dispute has led to jun@@ ior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all @ - @ out stop@@ p@@ ages in the history of the N@@ H@@ S .
the B@@ M@@ A 's jun@@ ior doctor leader , D@@ r Jo@@ han@@ n Mal@@ aw@@ ana , resigned following the vote to rej@@ ect the negoti@@ ated terms of the contract , which the B@@ M@@ A had recommended .
he had told B@@ M@@ A members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 5@@ 4,000 jun@@ ior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , Health Secretary Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said the contract would be imposed on medi@@ cs in Eng@@ land .
Russia and Turkey : an ' alliance of mis@@ f@@ its ' ?
it was a ges@@ ture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shak@@ e hands and declare a formal end to an eight @ - @ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as Vladimir Putin gre@@ e@@ ted his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded h@@ all of a St. Peter@@ s@@ burg pal@@ ace , I got the dist@@ inc@@ t impres@@ sion that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shak@@ e , yes .
but M@@ r Putin 's sm@@ ile lo@@ oked th@@ in and he was har@@ dly oo@@ z@@ ing war@@ m@@ th even by his own re@@ stra@@ ined standards .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talk@@ ed repeatedly of his " de@@ ar friend " M@@ r Putin - five times , according to one report .
I lost count .
he also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre @ - @ crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described M@@ r Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m imp@@ lied the op@@ pos@@ ite .
but a lin@@ ger@@ ing co@@ ol@@ ness em@@ an@@ ating from M@@ r Putin showed that Russia 's leader has for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : Turkey 's shooting down of a Russian figh@@ ter plan@@ e on the Syrian border .
Moscow 's reaction at the time was fur@@ ious .
M@@ r Putin las@@ hed out , accus@@ ing Ankara of st@@ ab@@ bing Moscow in the back .
the off@@ ence was even greater , coming from a sup@@ posed friend .
re@@ building real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
Russian public opinion has also turned since November .
for months , state @ - @ controlled media conducted a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing , all @ - @ out offen@@ sive against Ankara .
all of a su@@ d@@ den , it se@@ e@@ med like Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that M@@ r Erdogan 's own family has pro@@ fi@@ ted from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so @ - @ called Islamic State .
he 's denied that em@@ ph@@ ati@@ cally .
but in St. Peter@@ s@@ burg came the official message that it 's time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because M@@ r Putin got the ap@@ ology he demanded from President Erdogan .
Russia could claim a victory of sor@@ ts .
for Ankara the benefits of calling a tru@@ ce are clear .
first and fore@@ most , Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ous@@ ted from power last month in a failed coup .
repe@@ at terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shak@@ en him too .
there is also an economic mo@@ tive .
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on char@@ ter flights , which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has s@@ lum@@ ped by almost 90 % .
as for Russia , tour oper@@ ators and char@@ ter companies here will certainly be reli@@ ev@@ ed when flights eventually resume .
they 're banking on a late @ - @ season r@@ ush to the Mediterranean .
and even this week , state TV has been predic@@ ting che@@ aper fru@@ it and ve@@ get@@ ab@@ les once Turkish agricultural imports are per@@ mitted again .
" tourists that way , to@@ ma@@ to@@ es back here , " as a report in Ve@@ dem@@ os@@ ti newspaper ph@@ r@@ ased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is an@@ gr@@ y with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attemp@@ ted tak@@ e@@ over .
ad@@ d to that its long @ - @ standing gru@@ dge at the s@@ na@@ il 's pace of talks to join the EU and step in M@@ r Putin - who is ke@@ en to cap@@ it@@ alise on the ch@@ ill and c@@ hip away at Turkey 's ties with the West .
the Russian leader certainly won bon@@ us points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attemp@@ ted coup .
mind you , that 's a given for Moscow which has its own deep @ - @ se@@ ated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this g@@ lit@@ z@@ y , se@@ aside pal@@ ace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an " alliance of mis@@ f@@ its " : two countries that feel rejected and mist@@ re@@ ated by the West , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is Syria , where Moscow has recently been cas@@ ting itself as peac@@ em@@ aker but where Russia and Turkey back op@@ pos@@ ite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they ha@@ dn ' t even tou@@ ched on the topic .
Turkey 's president de@@ liber@@ ately avoi@@ ded ans@@ w@@ ering a question on their differences , while M@@ r Putin ch@@ ose to under@@ line them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ li@@ ty - and given the potential for ut@@ ter disaster when Na@@ to member Turkey shot down that Russian figh@@ ter j@@ et - it is su@@ rely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
ro@@ yal Bank of Scot@@ land to dis@@ appear for customers outside Scot@@ land
the br@@ and R@@ B@@ S is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank 's chief executive .
ro@@ yal Bank of Scot@@ land will dis@@ appear for customers outside Scot@@ land .
Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ w@@ an told BBC Scot@@ land that the R@@ B@@ S br@@ and was associ@@ ated with the bank 's global ambi@@ tions .
it has re@@ treated from them since it nearly collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be bail@@ ed out .
during that time , br@@ and strate@@ g@@ ists have used ' R@@ B@@ S ' to protect other consu@@ mer finance br@@ ands .
it was backed with millions of p@@ oun@@ ds in sponsor@@ ship of international s@@ port , from Si@@ x N@@ ations ru@@ g@@ by to W@@ im@@ ble@@ don champion Andy Mur@@ ra@@ y .
but now , it has been ju@@ dged right to let more national br@@ ands come to the fore .
ro@@ yal Bank of Scot@@ land will be used with Scot@@ tish customers , but will not be initi@@ alised .
in Eng@@ land and Wal@@ es , all R@@ B@@ S refer@@ ences , outside head office and the stock exchange l@@ isting , will be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ s@@ ter Bank br@@ and is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller br@@ ands for private banking , which will get more pro@@ min@@ ence - C@@ out@@ ts , A@@ dam & Co , Dr@@ um@@ mon@@ d , and Hol@@ t 's Military Bank .
M@@ r Mc@@ E@@ w@@ an was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @ - @ sh@@ ire .
he told BBC Scot@@ land : " the R@@ B@@ S br@@ and will end up becoming our investor br@@ and and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of br@@ ands . "
as the bank itself became a global br@@ and , R@@ B@@ S became the global br@@ and .
I 'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those br@@ ands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those br@@ ands .
R@@ B@@ S had already stated that it would not to continue its Si@@ x N@@ ations sponsor@@ ship , and it has been raising the profile of different br@@ ands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
" the time is right for us to move to the bank of br@@ ands , because under@@ ne@@ ath ( we 've been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? " said the chief executive .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago if we '@@ d said we 're going to be a great bank for customers and put those br@@ ands out there .
but with the work we 've been doing , focus@@ sing on the customers needs , not our own , I think you 're seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those br@@ ands back up again , so I think the time is right .

I 'm very em@@ o@@ tional because my family are here as well
I 'm very ple@@ ased for it to have happened at New@@ market because this is where I lan@@ ded 30 years ago .
it 's not a big meeting , it 's not a R@@ oy@@ al As@@ co@@ t - it 's a mun@@ dan@@ e Friday night with 20,000 people .
I 'm reli@@ ev@@ ed and very hum@@ ble .
D@@ et@@ tor@@ i so@@ aks up the che@@ ers as he brings in Pre@@ dil@@ ection after victory

Fran@@ ki@@ e is one of the best jo@@ c@@ ke@@ ys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this land@@ mark so few have achieved before him .
he is st@@ y@@ lish and strong , but it is his tac@@ tical n@@ ous that sets him apart from others in the weigh@@ ing room .
he is a fan@@ tas@@ tic ambassador for rac@@ ing , his en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m and char@@ is@@ ma have been drawing fans to the s@@ port for years .
I said to Fran@@ ki@@ e a few weeks ago at E@@ p@@ so@@ m he '@@ d have ri@@ d@@ den 6,000 win@@ ners if he was@@ n ' t just a weekend and big @ - @ race jo@@ c@@ key !
seriously though , Fran@@ ki@@ e 's been ri@@ ding win@@ ners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he 's a li@@ vely charac@@ ter which is good for British rac@@ ing but more than that , he 's an incre@@ di@@ ble jo@@ c@@ key .
Fran@@ ki@@ e D@@ et@@ tor@@ i celebrated the mil@@ est@@ one with a tra@@ dem@@ ar@@ k fl@@ ying dis@@ moun@@ t
from fl@@ ying fin@@ is@@ hes to fl@@ ying dis@@ moun@@ ts , Fran@@ ki@@ e D@@ et@@ tor@@ i has been the pos@@ ter bo@@ y of British F@@ lat rac@@ ing for two decades .
it has been a rol@@ ler@@ co@@ aster ri@@ de .
stac@@ ks of big @ - @ race win@@ ners , including his famous 1996 ' Mag@@ nific@@ ent S@@ even ' at As@@ co@@ t , but he also survi@@ ved a plan@@ e cr@@ ash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially strugg@@ led when returning from that six @ - @ month suspen@@ sion , but he showed for@@ mi@@ dable streng@@ th of charac@@ ter to def@@ y the doub@@ ters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - D@@ et@@ tor@@ i has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
Russia 's Putin sac@@ ks chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expec@@ tedly dismissed his chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivanov .
M@@ r Ivanov has been part of M@@ r Putin 's tr@@ us@@ ted in@@ ner circ@@ le for many years .
the 63 @ - @ year @ - @ old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the Kre@@ m@@ lin said that M@@ r Putin had " decre@@ ed to reli@@ eve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration , " but gave no reason .
M@@ r Ivanov 's deputy since 2012 , An@@ ton V@@ ain@@ o , has been appointed as his success@@ or .
M@@ r V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the Eston@@ ian capital Tal@@ lin@@ n in 197@@ 2 , he gradu@@ ated from the presti@@ gi@@ ous Moscow State Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and served in the Tok@@ yo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the Kre@@ m@@ lin website says ( in Russian ) .
on being appointed , he told M@@ r Putin : " than@@ k you for your trust . "
I think the administration 's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of draf@@ ting laws and control over how your in@@ struc@@ tions are implemented .
M@@ r Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that M@@ r Ivanov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that M@@ r V@@ ain@@ o should replace him .
do the s@@ mil@@ es convince ?
this is a move that has my@@ sti@@ fied Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin 's clos@@ est allies and , like him , served in the Soviet security service , the K@@ G@@ B .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was ste@@ pping down at his own request .
but despite the s@@ mil@@ es for the cam@@ er@@ as , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall @ - @ out from some kind of power struggle ?
no @ - @ one kno@@ ws yet .
but the official claim - that a man once tou@@ ted as a potential president , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly wanted to run Russia 's environmental policy - has been met with great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in remarks to M@@ r Putin , quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , M@@ r Ivanov said " it 's true that in early 2012 I asked you , in a con@@ vers@@ ation , to entr@@ ust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troub@@ le@@ some post , for four years .
well , it tur@@ ns out that I 've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
M@@ r Ivanov took up the post in December 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the K@@ G@@ B state security service , like M@@ r Putin .
in the late 1990s , when M@@ r Putin was head of the F@@ ederal Security Service ( F@@ S@@ B ) , which replaced the K@@ G@@ B , M@@ r Ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
when M@@ r Putin came to power , he named M@@ r Ivanov as one of the five people he tr@@ us@@ ted most .
it was once thought that M@@ r Ivanov might become president of Russia after M@@ r Putin 's second term , as a third term for M@@ r Putin would have been un@@ constitutional .
but that post was taken by another close Putin ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Medvedev .
M@@ r Putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three @ - @ and @ - @ a @ - @ half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star T@@ ho@@ mas G@@ ib@@ son sac@@ ked after hit@@ ting producer
G@@ ib@@ son was involved in a phy@@ sical alter@@ cation on the set of the show in L@@ os An@@ gele@@ s last month .
AB@@ C Stu@@ di@@ os and C@@ B@@ S Tele@@ vision Stu@@ di@@ os , which produce the series , announced his dismis@@ sal in a joint statement .
G@@ ib@@ son , who played Special A@@ gent A@@ ar@@ on Hot@@ ch@@ ner , issued an ap@@ ology on Thursday before his termin@@ ation was announced .
there were cre@@ ative differences on the set and a dis@@ agreement .
I regre@@ t that it occurred , " he said in a statement .
details on how G@@ ib@@ son 's charac@@ ter will be written out of the show , which follows a team of F@@ B@@ I ag@@ ents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the AB@@ C Stu@@ di@@ os and C@@ B@@ S Tele@@ vision Stu@@ di@@ os statement .
the 54 @ - @ year @ - @ old , who previously star@@ red on the s@@ it@@ com D@@ har@@ ma & Gre@@ g , had been on the show since its first season in 2005 .
" I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my heart and sou@@ l into it for the last tw@@ el@@ ve years , " G@@ ib@@ son said in a statement released on Friday .
I had hoped to see it through to the end , but that won ' t be possible now .
I would just like to say than@@ k you to the writ@@ ers , producers , actors , our amaz@@ ing cre@@ w , and , most importan@@ tly , the best fans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is s@@ lated to return for its tw@@ el@@ f@@ th season on 28 September .

Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry C@@ ros@@ sing : bridge now connected to F@@ ife
the £ 1.@@ 35 b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 20@@ 17
engine@@ ers have joined the Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry C@@ ros@@ sing 's north dec@@ k and Vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t - mean@@ ing the bridge is now connected to F@@ ife .
it is the first of four clos@@ ures between the " dec@@ k fans , " which are now ne@@ aring completion around each of the bridge 's three tow@@ ers .
the bridge section from F@@ ife is now 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay @ - @ cab@@ les .
the £ 1.@@ 35 b@@ n project is now due to be complete by May 20@@ 17 .
economy Secretary Ke@@ ith Bro@@ wn visited the site today and was among the first to wal@@ k from the land on to the bridge .
he said : " this is a historic and symbol@@ ic moment in the building of the Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ fer@@ ry C@@ ros@@ sing .
we 're all wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing engine@@ ering on a tr@@ uly ep@@ ic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and we@@ ight of the bridge comple@@ ting the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t and bridge dec@@ k is a de@@ lic@@ ate operation involving extremely prec@@ ise toler@@ ances for f@@ it up .
overall , nearly 7@@ 9 % of the total bridge dec@@ k is now in place , the final section of dec@@ k is having its concrete dec@@ k cast in Ros@@ y@@ th today , mean@@ ing all the dec@@ k is ready to be lif@@ ted into place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , for@@ th C@@ ros@@ sing Bri@@ dge Con@@ struc@@ tors project director said : " the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant mil@@ est@@ one .
on this fan@@ tas@@ tic project , this closure represents leading ed@@ ge civil engine@@ ering .
after instal@@ ling the last road dec@@ k section and connec@@ ting it to the expan@@ ding North T@@ ow@@ er road dec@@ k , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or land@@ ward - side .
this was done by pul@@ ling the northern approach Vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t 700 milli@@ metres sou@@ th@@ wards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very de@@ lic@@ ate operation .
massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t is 2@@ 22 metres long , weigh@@ s approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pul@@ led up a gra@@ di@@ ent of about 3 % .

Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re B@@ ay rescue : three men are ' lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve '
three men are " lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve " after they were thro@@ wn from their fis@@ hing bo@@ at off An@@ g@@ le@@ se@@ y .
Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ L@@ I li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at station raised the alar@@ m at 13 : 20 B@@ S@@ T on Friday after a cre@@ w saw the incident un@@ f@@ old in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re B@@ ay .
the three men strugg@@ led to sw@@ im to safety while their bo@@ at continued under its own power .
" we saw their bo@@ at cir@@ cl@@ ing close to them and ima@@ gin@@ ed the worst , " said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at hel@@ m V@@ ince J@@ ones .
" F@@ ort@@ un@@ ately , by the time we had launched , the strong win@@ ds had blo@@ wn it clear of them , " he added .
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fis@@ hing bo@@ at , while the third man , aged 60 , was found ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted and cl@@ inging to a bu@@ oy without a li@@ fe@@ j@@ ac@@ ket .
they were all taken on board the in@@ sh@@ ore li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at and brought back to the li@@ fe@@ bo@@ at station
M@@ r J@@ ones said : " the three men thro@@ wn in the water are lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve and completely un@@ injured .

P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o a wor@@ th@@ y hun@@ t for health and happ@@ iness
it is fas@@ cin@@ ating to see how the world tur@@ ns .
that te@@ en@@ agers and children do not get outside to play any more , pre@@ fer@@ ring to spend their free time looking at scre@@ ens , has been the la@@ ment of many for the the past decade .
P@@ ok@@ em@@ on G@@ o is getting people off the cou@@ ch and into some activity .
scre@@ en time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently sm@@ art@@ ph@@ ones .
so it is great to see that technology and being active out@@ doors are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I am of course referring to the cra@@ ze that is P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o , an ap@@ p based on the charac@@ ters first created for video games in the 1990s ( it later sp@@ aw@@ ned a car@@ to@@ on series , playing cards and other sp@@ in off@@ s ) .
like many pop cultural phenom@@ ena it had gone off the bo@@ il some@@ what before this new game was made available in the US , Australia and New Ze@@ al@@ and in early July .
the launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response , which over@@ lo@@ aded ser@@ vers .
within days , P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o had more users than tin@@ der and nearly as many as T@@ wit@@ ter .
so how does it work ?
in a n@@ ut@@ shel@@ l , players on sm@@ art@@ ph@@ ones go out looking for P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which are trac@@ ked with a G@@ PS and , once found , can be ' photo@@ grap@@ hed ' ( via a scre@@ en@@ shot on your phone ) or ' cap@@ tured ' .
a generation who played the game when youn@@ ger have joined the cra@@ ze , jum@@ ping off the cou@@ ch for the search .
in the US , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the " average " person each day .
car@@ di@@ o@@ gra@@ m , an ap@@ p for the Ap@@ ple Wat@@ ch that trac@@ ks 3@@ 5,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching , the number of people it trac@@ ked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jum@@ ped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o - it just sees ra@@ w data on exercise levels .
many public health campaigns to get people to " find 30 , " " get off the cou@@ ch " and " be active every@@ day " have fal@@ len on de@@ af e@@ ars because most public health messages are bor@@ ing and delivered by people who look mis@@ er@@ able .
yet the importance of exercise can not be under@@ stated .
those who exercise regular@@ ly reduce their chances of getting cancer or de@@ pres@@ sion .
activity hel@@ ps with we@@ ight management , high blo@@ od pressure , di@@ ab@@ e@@ tes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the be@@ a@@ uty of P@@ ok@@ é@@ m@@ on G@@ o is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy .
thus you are covering three pil@@ lar@@ s of health - movement , fresh air and sun@@ sh@@ ine , and f@@ un .
some people are even making new friends on the hun@@ t .
as us@@ ual there are P@@ o @ - @ faced kil@@ lj@@ oy@@ s looking for something to compla@@ in about .
and yes some@@ body might wal@@ k into a door .
so what ?

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es n@@ ail@@ s all @ - @ around gold in women 's gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics

and now , finally , an Olympic champion .
the 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old American gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast so@@ ar@@ ed to the all @ - @ around title on Thursday , putting the gap between her@@ self and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic sp@@ ot@@ light .
her total of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was well clear of silver med@@ alist and " Fin@@ al F@@ ive " te@@ am@@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mustaf@@ ina .
United States ' Sim@@ one Bil@@ es perfor@@ ms on the balance be@@ am during the arti@@ sti@@ c gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics women 's individual all @ - @ around final at the 20@@ 16 Summer Olympics in R@@ io de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o , Bra@@ z@@ il , Thursday .
Bil@@ es became the fourth stra@@ ight American woman to win the all @ - @ around title and fifth overall while c@@ em@@ enting her rep@@ ut@@ ation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she bur@@ st into te@@ ars when her final total was pos@@ ted and her long jour@@ ney to this moment ended .
the achievement pu@@ ts her in the same le@@ ague as once @ - @ in @ - @ a @ - @ generation athletes like Michael P@@ hel@@ ps who have taken their sports to new he@@ ights :
Bil@@ es has spent the last three years domin@@ ating her s@@ port , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with rout@@ ines so ast@@ on@@ ishing in their mi@@ x of ambi@@ tion and prec@@ ision that 1984 Olympic champion M@@ ary L@@ ou R@@ et@@ ton called her " the greatest gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast I 've ever seen . "
one last test aw@@ ai@@ ted in Bra@@ z@@ il , a contest not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the field but between her@@ self and the burden of over@@ siz@@ ed expectations .
anything less than head@@ ing back to her family 's home in S@@ pr@@ ing , T@@ ex@@ as , with a f@@ ist@@ ful of gol@@ ds would be seen as a dis@@ appointment .
United States ' Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man em@@ br@@ ace after winning gold and silver respectively for the arti@@ sti@@ c gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics women 's individual all @ - @ around final at the 20@@ 16 Summer Olympics in R@@ io de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o , Bra@@ z@@ il , Thursday , Au@@ g .
Bil@@ es ear@@ ned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the ex@@ cla@@ mation point to re@@ tir@@ ing national team co@@ ordinator Mar@@ th@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi 's going away party .
while Bil@@ es insisted she 's never lo@@ oked ahead during her long run at the top , that 's not exac@@ tly true .
a portion of her flo@@ or exercise rout@@ ine - the one that includes her sign@@ ature t@@ umb@@ ling pass - is set to Latin music that would f@@ it right at home in the street right outside the R@@ io Olympic Ar@@ ena .
it 's not a co@@ inci@@ dence .
the gir@@ l adopted by her gr@@ and@@ parents as a to@@ d@@ d@@ ler and discovered by coach A@@ i@@ me@@ e Bo@@ or@@ man 's mother during a field trip to the gy@@ m where Bo@@ or@@ man was co@@ ac@@ hing has become a force .
she has@@ n ' t lost an all @ - @ around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak that should go for as long as Bil@@ es wants it to .
though Mustaf@@ ina took a small lead through two rot@@ ations , it was a mi@@ ra@@ ge .
balance be@@ am and flo@@ or exercise - where Bil@@ es is the def@@ ending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15@@ .@@ 4@@ 33 on be@@ am - and cap@@ ped it with a 15@@ .@@ 9@@ 33 on flo@@ or .
Ra@@ is@@ man h@@ ug@@ ged her gen@@ tly as they aw@@ ai@@ ted the final score - a m@@ ere for@@ mal@@ ity - and te@@ ars appeared around Bil@@ es ' g@@ lit@@ tery red , wh@@ ite and blu@@ e ey@@ el@@ in@@ er when the vision she once wrote in a s@@ cr@@ ap@@ book became a reality .
Ra@@ is@@ man 's performance was a bit of reven@@ ge from four years ago , when she ti@@ ed for third but lost the bronze to Mustaf@@ ina on a ti@@ eb@@ re@@ aker .
this time , the 22 @ - @ year @ - @ old team cap@@ tain the Americ@@ ans call " Gr@@ and@@ ma " was well ahead .
she ble@@ w k@@ is@@ ses to the crowd after her flo@@ or exercise , overcome by a co@@ me@@ back that at times se@@ e@@ med in doubt .
as for Bil@@ es , the 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old 's vir@@ al t@@ we@@ et from earlier this week now carri@@ es a whole new mean@@ ing :
police : 3 victims in ser@@ ial kil@@ ler case shot while l@@ ist@@ ening to music in car
two women and a 12 @ - @ year @ - @ old gir@@ l who died in the dead@@ li@@ est attack in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x 's first ser@@ ial kil@@ ler case in a decade were s@@ it@@ ting in a car talking and l@@ ist@@ ening to music when they were shot , according to police reports released Thursday .
Angela Ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le lin@@ er , Stefan@@ ie R@@ . El@@ lis and El@@ lis ' da@@ ughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , authorities said .
the gun@@ man fired as many as eight sh@@ ots from a hand@@ gun while standing on the passen@@ ger side of the car then fled in another vehic@@ le , the report states .
police say the tri@@ ple killing doesn ' t appear to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y because the att@@ ack@@ er didn ' t take pur@@ ses or $ 2,@@ 900 in the pos@@ session of one of the ad@@ ult victims .
P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x police spokesman S@@ g@@ t@@ . Jon@@ a@@ than Ho@@ ward said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was ti@@ ed to four earlier attacks .
in all , seven people have been killed and two others wo@@ unded in nine attacks in two pre@@ dom@@ inan@@ tly H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods over a four @ - @ month period .
" it 's oc@@ curr@@ ing within a residen@@ tial area in front of a home , " Ho@@ ward said to C@@ B@@ S af@@ fil@@ i@@ ate K@@ P@@ H@@ O earlier this month .
the suspect is believed to have used several vehicles , including as a late @ - @ 1990s bro@@ wn Nis@@ san , a late @ - @ 1990s black B@@ MW and a wh@@ ite C@@ ad@@ il@@ la@@ c or L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n .
investigators have declined to reve@@ al the evidence that led them to conclu@@ de the attacks are related and committed by the same kil@@ ler .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ al@@ ized for her injur@@ ies and later died .
lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis ' da@@ ughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died at the scene .
a witness told police that it was@@ n ' t un@@ us@@ ual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car l@@ ist@@ ening to music .
authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an un@@ occup@@ ied pic@@ k@@ up tru@@ ck just a half @ - @ hour before the tri@@ ple killing and is believed to have been the work of the ser@@ ial kil@@ ler .
investigators found bul@@ let cas@@ ings and recover@@ ed a bul@@ let from a seat and bul@@ let frag@@ ments from the eng@@ ine com@@ partment .
mother of 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old with m@@ ic@@ ro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : " it gets better "

but un@@ like most of his pe@@ ers , Ed@@ mun@@ d has m@@ ic@@ ro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a gen@@ e@@ tic dis@@ order his mo@@ m Eli@@ zab@@ eth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to didn ' t know about while pre@@ gn@@ ant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , I can ' t do this .
I can ' t do this .
I didn ' t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it , " she said .
she and her hus@@ band , V@@ inc@@ ent , were told Ed@@ mun@@ d might never reco@@ g@@ ni@@ ze them , and that he might not even survi@@ ve .
some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institu@@ tion@@ al@@ ized .
" my first response was ' I didn ' t think people did that any@@ more , ' " Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained .
Ed@@ mun@@ d w@@ alk@@ s with the help of a W@@ alk@@ er .

I kept saying , what 's going to happen ?

heavy rain , flo@@ o@@ ding promp@@ ts resc@@ ues in L@@ ou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi
heavy rain and widespread flo@@ o@@ ding in L@@ ou@@ is@@ i@@ ana lead the govern@@ or to declare a state of emergency on Friday , with more rain expected over the state through Saturday .
numerous ri@@ vers in southeast L@@ ou@@ is@@ i@@ ana and southern Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi were over@@ f@@ low@@ ing their banks and threat@@ ening widespread flo@@ o@@ ding after extre@@ me ra@@ inf@@ all , the National We@@ ather Service reported .
L@@ ou@@ is@@ i@@ ana G@@ ov@@ . John B@@ el Ed@@ wards said state officials are in constan@@ t contact with local officials , and assistance is already on the move to affected par@@ is@@ hes .
Mik@@ e Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Governor 's Office of Ho@@ me@@ land Security and E@@ mer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edn@@ ess , said requests were coming in for high @ - @ water vehicles , bo@@ ats and sand@@ b@@ ag@@ s .
Ste@@ ele said Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a par@@ ish alone requested tens of thousands of sand@@ b@@ ag@@ s .
a flo@@ od watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south L@@ ou@@ is@@ i@@ ana .
the we@@ ather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 in@@ ches could fall over the area .
in south A@@ la@@ b@@ ama , a flo@@ od watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mob@@ ile area .
the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on R@@ ou@@ ge and Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham S@@ pr@@ ings , both in L@@ ou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , were predic@@ ted to set record cre@@ sts over the weekend .
Fo@@ rec@@ aster A@@ le@@ k Kra@@ ut@@ mann said both ri@@ vers could flo@@ od many houses in su@@ bur@@ ban areas near Bat@@ on R@@ ou@@ ge .
he also said that flo@@ o@@ ding down@@ stre@@ am in As@@ cen@@ sion par@@ ish is a threat , as those sw@@ ol@@ len ri@@ vers will be slow to dra@@ in into L@@ ake M@@ au@@ rep@@ as .
the Tic@@ k@@ fa@@ w River , just south of the Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi state line in Li@@ ver@@ po@@ ol , L@@ ou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a@@ .@@ m@@ . Friday .
res@@ cu@@ ers were still p@@ luc@@ king people from flo@@ od@@ waters in Am@@ ite and W@@ ilk@@ in@@ son coun@@ ties in sou@@ th@@ west Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi .
L@@ er@@ oy H@@ ans@@ for@@ d , his wife and ste@@ p@@ son were among those res@@ cu@@ ed earlier Friday near G@@ los@@ ter .
H@@ ans@@ for@@ d , 62 , says waters from Be@@ av@@ er Cre@@ ek , which is nor@@ m@@ ally more than 400 fe@@ et away from his house , rose quickly over@@ night .
he said another ste@@ p@@ son who lives nearby al@@ er@@ ted him .
" we w@@ oke up and the water kept on coming , " H@@ ans@@ for@@ d said .
it came up to my wa@@ ist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ for@@ d that it 's the highest she 's seen the cre@@ ek in the 48 years she 's lived there .
H@@ ans@@ for@@ d said he and his family members all have dis@@ abilities , and he 's the only one who can sw@@ im .
H@@ ans@@ for@@ d said emergency workers res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military @ - @ st@@ yle tru@@ ck and took them to the fire station in G@@ los@@ ter , where they were shel@@ tering Friday .
Kra@@ ut@@ mann says flo@@ o@@ ding is " quickly becoming widespread " as heavy ra@@ ins continue , saying officials are considering ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ation orders .
Kra@@ ut@@ mann says one observer near Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on reported 13@@ .@@ 75 in@@ ches of rain from mid@@ night to Friday morning .
Kra@@ ut@@ mann said the ground was heav@@ ily sat@@ ur@@ ated by ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
heavy rain and street flo@@ o@@ ding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a par@@ ish and the cancel@@ lation of cl@@ ass@@ es in five school distri@@ c@@ ts , authorities said .
C@@ B@@ S af@@ fil@@ i@@ ate W@@ W@@ L reports that an al@@ der@@ woman in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a said 200 homes flo@@ o@@ ded .
residents had been ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated to two churches but both are now flo@@ o@@ ding .
par@@ ish President R@@ ob@@ by Miller said authorities res@@ cu@@ ed 72 people and seven p@@ ets st@@ ran@@ ded by high water .
shel@@ ters have been opened in the town of Am@@ ite and the city of Ham@@ mon@@ d to house those who were ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated .
" they will be allowed to return home once the water star@@ ts to rec@@ ede , " he said .
in the Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a par@@ ish city of Ham@@ mon@@ d , close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water , and sand@@ b@@ ag@@ s were made available for pic@@ k@@ up by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses .
" the last major flo@@ od we had was in March , " said city administr@@ ator L@@ acy L@@ and@@ rum .
this one is on track to be a similar event .
in Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ p@@ pi , Har@@ ris@@ on Coun@@ ty E@@ mer@@ gency Man@@ ager Ru@@ per@@ t L@@ acy said stead@@ y rain continued on the G@@ ul@@ f Co@@ ast .
he said a hand@@ ful of houses were reported as flo@@ o@@ ded Thursday , but none have been reported so far Friday .
Ke@@ ith T@@ ow@@ n@@ son , manager of shop@@ per Val@@ ue Fo@@ ods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
" I 've seen water in some places I have never seen before , " T@@ ow@@ n@@ son said , " and it 's still coming down . "
Ma@@ ha@@ j Bro@@ wn , 6 , " ri@@ d@@ d@@ led with bul@@ lets , " survi@@ ves Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a shooting
police say a 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old bo@@ y has been shot in Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a , marking the second shooting of a 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old in the city this week .
the child 's gr@@ and@@ parents identified him to C@@ B@@ S Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a as Ma@@ ha@@ j Bro@@ wn .
the gr@@ and@@ parents say Bro@@ wn suffered multi@@ ple gun@@ shot wo@@ unds , including in his gro@@ in , le@@ g , ar@@ m and ab@@ do@@ men , but was aw@@ ake when he was transpor@@ ted to the hospital .
" he just took a lot , his little body was ri@@ d@@ d@@ led with bul@@ lets , " his gr@@ and@@ mother De@@ Lo@@ res M@@ elen@@ de@@ z tells the station .
I just can ' t believe it .
the bo@@ y is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has under@@ gone several sur@@ ger@@ ies .
family tells the station he is expected to rec@@ over .
he was set to start first gra@@ de at a local ele@@ men@@ tary school .
Bro@@ wn was among four people shot in the Ger@@ man@@ town section .
also shot were three men : two 29 @ - @ year @ - @ ol@@ ds and one 32 @ - @ year old .
one of the 29 @ - @ year @ - @ old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to C@@ B@@ S Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29 @ - @ year @ - @ old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investig@@ ating whether any of the wo@@ unded men could be a sho@@ o@@ ter .
investigators tells C@@ B@@ S Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a it appears there was cross@@ fire between multi@@ ple gun@@ men .
assa@@ ult weap@@ on @ - @ st@@ yle shel@@ l cas@@ ings , trac@@ ed to different assa@@ ult st@@ yle weapons , lit@@ tered the scene .
it appears that this was defin@@ itely an ongoing battle .
there were cas@@ ings in the street , on both sides of the side@@ wal@@ k .
so it appears that there were multi@@ ple armed comb@@ atan@@ ts out here and that they were activ@@ ely engaged , " Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a police Cap@@ tain An@@ th@@ ony G@@ in@@ al@@ di told the station .
multi@@ ple houses and vehicles in the area were also stru@@ ck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly re@@ vie@@ wing sur@@ ve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce video .
another 6 @ - @ year @ - @ old , a gir@@ l , was hit in her ar@@ m by a stra@@ y bul@@ let Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West o@@ ak L@@ ane neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
she is recover@@ ing , and police are still sear@@ ching for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and La@@ ur@@ ie
that 's what I call this year 's Women 's Olympic G@@ y@@ m@@ nas@@ tics Te@@ am and for more reasons than one .
first , I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U@@ SA has never been so domin@@ ant .
and second : this team features three gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , G@@ ab@@ by D@@ ou@@ g@@ las and L@@ au@@ ren " La@@ ur@@ ie " Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z , who have been in@@ spir@@ ing so many young gir@@ ls of col@@ or .
the make @ - @ up of this team , roun@@ ded out by A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , who is Je@@ wish , and Mad@@ ison Ko@@ ci@@ an , who is Catholic , is making everyone pro@@ ud .
this team looks , finally , like America .
it also has sol@@ idi@@ fied the black and Lat@@ ina female presence at the top of this s@@ port .
for the past four years , the number one female gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast has been Afri@@ can @ - @ American .
last year , Sim@@ one and G@@ ab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last Olympics , G@@ ab@@ by D@@ ou@@ g@@ las was a surprise Olympic champion , and America che@@ ered .
now the world has been able to witness the incre@@ di@@ ble performances of three @ - @ time World Cha@@ mp@@ ion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , D@@ ou@@ g@@ las and La@@ ur@@ ie Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z deliver@@ ing the un@@ expected , yet mas@@ ter@@ ful gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth stra@@ ight American to win gold in the women 's individual all @ - @ around event .
and te@@ am@@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man ear@@ ned silver .
we are wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing the top of the s@@ port , but it does not look like this at gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics cl@@ ass@@ es across the country .
Sim@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and La@@ ur@@ ie all took the same path as A@@ ly and Mad@@ ison to make the Olympic team .
they are the " Fin@@ al F@@ ive " because the next Olympic gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics team will only have four gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ts on the team , and this is Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ yi 's last year co@@ ac@@ hing .
but the reality is that gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics is an expensive s@@ port , and gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ts primarily train in private gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics clu@@ bs that are main@@ tained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uni@@ forms , competition fe@@ es , hotel fe@@ es ( for the co@@ aches and their gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics clu@@ bs are located in aff@@ lu@@ ent su@@ bur@@ ban neigh@@ bor@@ ho@@ ods that can support the business .
these clu@@ bs are where the gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ts get all of their training , and it 's a cos@@ tly and long @ - @ term commitment for the gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ts ' families .
A@@ i@@ me@@ e Bo@@ or@@ man , coach of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gi@@ e H@@ an@@ ey , coach of La@@ ur@@ ie Her@@ n@@ an@@ de@@ z , have both co@@ ac@@ hed their athletes since they started in gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics .
we must bring more affor@@ dable and ac@@ ces@@ sible gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics training to the communities of coun@@ t@@ less young gir@@ ls who are in@@ sp@@ ired by Sim@@ one , G@@ ab@@ by and La@@ ur@@ ie .
I founded my gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organiz@@ ations , we have provided free and low @ - @ cost gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics , based in Har@@ lem , for over 15@@ ,000 urban youth ( primarily black and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and have trained national and international champ@@ ions .
in September , we will be expan@@ ding to D@@ et@@ ro@@ it ( my home@@ town ) to provide high quality gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics to the youth that de@@ serve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic s@@ port .
gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics develop@@ s streng@@ th , flexi@@ bility and co@@ ordination for the body and hard work , discipl@@ ine and determination for the mind .
this combin@@ ation provides life @ - @ long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the in@@ spir@@ ation of this team that will send thousands of young gir@@ ls to take gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics and that is great .
to participate in s@@ port is so important , especially for gir@@ ls .
this is such an ex@@ citing time .
than@@ k you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , La@@ ur@@ ie , G@@ ab@@ by and Mad@@ ison for that serious sho@@ w@@ case of " G@@ ir@@ l Pow@@ er " in winning the Olympic team gold and for motiv@@ ating so many young gir@@ ls of all back@@ grounds to begin their path to be health@@ y , strong and successful young women .
jun@@ ior doctors set to moun@@ t further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t 's proposal
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agre@@ eing to a refor@@ med contract with British Medi@@ cal Association officials , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,000 jun@@ ior doctors who took part in a bal@@ lot had rejected it .
in July , M@@ r Hun@@ t revealed plans to impose the contract saying the N@@ H@@ S was in " no man 's land " and any further delay would be dama@@ ging for staff and patients .
the first jun@@ ior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to over@@ night and weekend working practices to improve care at un@@ soci@@ able hours .
D@@ r El@@ len Mc@@ Court , the B@@ M@@ A 's jun@@ ior doctors " committee cha@@ ir , said in a statement last night : " jun@@ ior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current work@@ force crisis , and that it fails to tre@@ at all doctors fair@@ ly . "
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the B@@ M@@ A to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an un@@ willingness to eng@@ age and , at times , de@@ af@@ ening sil@@ ence from the government .
this is despite a promise from Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t just last month that his door is always open .
" Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , li@@ ft the im@@ position and address jun@@ ior doctors " concerns .
if he does not then jun@@ ior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of April saw the postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 rout@@ ine operations and 100,000 appoin@@ tments as nurses and consul@@ tan@@ ts were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the pic@@ ket line .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agre@@ eing to a refor@@ med contract with British Medi@@ cal Association officials .
the B@@ M@@ A wants better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 jun@@ ior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ ti@@ mer , chief executive of N@@ H@@ S Em@@ plo@@ yers , called on jun@@ ior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
M@@ r Mor@@ ti@@ mer said : " industrial action achiev@@ es little or nothing , but places pressure on already st@@ ret@@ ched teams and services and ca@@ uses worry , dist@@ ress and dis@@ ruption for patients , car@@ ers and their families . "
over the last two months we have been talking with the Jun@@ ior Do@@ c@@ tors Committee and have , along with the Department of Health and others , responded positi@@ vely to their concerns regarding the Guardian R@@ ole and W@@ hist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ing .
employers were hop@@ eful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexi@@ bility in training , additional training for those returning from career break@@ s , costs of training , mutual recognition of sy@@ l@@ la@@ bus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , Health Education Eng@@ land and the Department of Health were about hon@@ our@@ ing the agreements reached with the B@@ M@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @ - @ a @ - @ day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2 @ - @ a @ - @ day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti @ - @ cl@@ ot@@ ting drug tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or s@@ l@@ ashes the risk of repe@@ at attacks for people with heart dis@@ ease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stro@@ ke or another attack .
N@@ H@@ S wat@@ ch@@ do@@ g n@@ ice has advis@@ ed that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular problems .
but now N@@ H@@ S wat@@ ch@@ do@@ g n@@ ice has advis@@ ed that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people have a heart attack in Eng@@ land every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stro@@ ke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by the build @ - @ up of f@@ at@@ ty material in ar@@ tery wal@@ ls to form a pla@@ que .
if the pla@@ que break@@ s apart it can cause a blo@@ od c@@ lot , blocking blo@@ od to the heart ca@@ using a heart attack .
and if the c@@ lot dis@@ lo@@ dges it can travel in the blo@@ od stre@@ am and block blo@@ od f@@ low to the bra@@ in , ca@@ using a stro@@ ke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
Tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , which is made by UK firm A@@ stra@@ Z@@ en@@ ec@@ a and sold under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , re@@ du@@ ces this risk by making cl@@ ots less likely .
the draft n@@ ice gu@@ id@@ ance , published today , recommen@@ ds that people be given 90 M@@ G of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or for 12 months , followed by 60 m@@ g along with aspir@@ in twice a day for another three years .
professor Car@@ ole Lon@@ g@@ son , director at the n@@ ice health technology evalu@@ ation centre , said : " despite the avail@@ ability of effective secondary prevention treat@@ ments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stro@@ ke - often with dev@@ ast@@ ating consequences . "
fear of a rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence can have a significant negative impact on a person 's quality of life .
the evidence shows that tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or , in combin@@ ation with aspir@@ in , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisi@@ on@@ ally recommen@@ ding tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or we are ple@@ ased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the e@@ ffic@@ acy and safety of tic@@ agre@@ l@@ or - particularly the risk of ble@@ eding - beyond three years is limited , the draft gu@@ id@@ ance does not recommen@@ d treatment with it beyond that period .
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flo@@ ur@@ ish
e@@ x @ - @ T@@ ow@@ er Ham@@ lets mayor Lut@@ f@@ ur R@@ ah@@ man was removed from office last year for corruption , promp@@ ting the government report
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to a b@@ lin@@ d eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities , a dev@@ ast@@ ating government report reve@@ als today .
e@@ x @ - @ C@@ ab@@ inet minister S@@ ir Eri@@ c Pic@@ k@@ les lam@@ bas@@ ts the police , election wat@@ ch@@ do@@ gs and town hal@@ ls for ig@@ nor@@ ing evidence of electoral abuse because of " over @ - @ sensi@@ tiv@@ ities about ethnic@@ ity and religion . "
the former communities secretary , now the anti @ - @ corruption t@@ sa@@ r , said the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cor@@ d@@ ons outside polling stations to protect fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed voters .
he recommen@@ ds that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter mer@@ ely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting in@@ deli@@ ble ink on a person 's fin@@ gers as they cast their bal@@ lot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers , S@@ ir Eri@@ c says .
he calls for the Press to be given greater access to council p@@ apers and decisions taken by un@@ official commit@@ tees or working groups .
" this is not so@@ le@@ ly to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the bro@@ ader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , " he said .
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street in the wake of the T@@ ow@@ er Ham@@ lets voting scandal in East London .
last year a special election court ruled the s@@ it@@ ting mayor , Lut@@ f@@ ur R@@ ah@@ man , should be removed from office following a li@@ tan@@ y of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found R@@ ah@@ man " cy@@ n@@ ically per@@ ver@@ ted " the religious feel@@ ing of his Muslim community and sil@@ enced his critics with accusations of rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
R@@ ah@@ man , it was said , " ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of fa@@ ith@@ ful Muslims to vote for him . "
up to 300 votes were du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of person@@ ation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
S@@ ir Eri@@ c said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alar@@ m about pos@@ tal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have ex@@ er@@ ted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their cho@@ os@@ ing .
S@@ ir Eri@@ c , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
his report says : " evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the el@@ ders , especially in communities of Pak@@ ist@@ ani and Ban@@ g@@ la@@ de@@ sh@@ i back@@ ground .
" there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a b@@ lin@@ d eye to such behavi@@ our because of " politically correc@@ t " over @ - @ sensi@@ tiv@@ ities about ethnic@@ ity and religion . "
S@@ ir Eri@@ c made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including ban@@ ning political activists from hand@@ ling pos@@ tal bal@@ lot p@@ apers to stop " vote har@@ ves@@ ting . "
the report , being considered by T@@ her@@ esa May , also calls for tou@@ gh@@ er chec@@ ks on registration to prevent the electoral reg@@ ister being used for immig@@ ration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requ@@ iring voters to produce ID before voting .
use in@@ deli@@ ble ink on a person 's fin@@ gers once they cast their bal@@ lot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out syste@@ matic chec@@ ks on a person 's nation@@ ality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three @ - @ year limit on requests for an auto@@ matic pos@@ tal vote .
ban political campaig@@ ners and activists from hand@@ ling completed pos@@ tal votes and pos@@ tal vote en@@ v@@ elop@@ es .
give police powers to set up cor@@ d@@ ons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with inti@@ mid@@ ation under the Represent@@ ation of the People Ac@@ t 198@@ 3 .
make it illegal to take pic@@ tures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations ( except in Wal@@ es ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff en@@ force the rule that voters go to the bo@@ ot@@ h alone .
S@@ ir Eri@@ c sav@@ ages the Met@@ ro@@ pol@@ itan Police , saying it is " ast@@ on@@ ishing " that no criminal charges were brought after the T@@ ow@@ er Ham@@ lets case .
" the election court dis@@ quali@@ fied Lut@@ f@@ ur R@@ ah@@ man and his ag@@ ent for a li@@ tan@@ y of corrupt and illegal practices , " he said .
he was found guilty beyond reas@@ onable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effec@@ tu@@ al " tic@@ k @ - @ bo@@ x inspec@@ tions " of town h@@ all electoral registration de@@ part@@ ments .
S@@ ir Eri@@ c said : " last year 's court ruling in T@@ ow@@ er Ham@@ lets was a wake @ - @ up call .
our nation has a pro@@ ud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , yet the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and state of den@@ ial by some bodies threat@@ ens that good rep@@ ut@@ ation .

com@@ ment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald thought his m@@ ic was turned off when he started to dis@@ pen@@ se some of his own opinions at the end of the women 's 4@@ x@@ 200m fre@@ est@@ yle rela@@ y final .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board C@@ BC 's commen@@ tary team to provide ' col@@ or ' could be heard saying : ' that little 14 @ - @ year @ - @ old from China dropped the ball , bab@@ y ' .
too ex@@ cited , went out like st@@ ink , died like a pi@@ g .

Chinese swim@@ mer A@@ I Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second le@@ g of the rela@@ y in 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 7@@ 9 - 1.@@ 61 secon@@ ds s@@ lower than Canada 's Tay@@ l@@ or R@@ uc@@ k , allowing the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap on China .
vie@@ wers across Canada were quick to re@@ act online after being sho@@ cked by the t@@ one and the language used
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lan@@ e t@@ we@@ e@@ ted , " did the C@@ BC announc@@ er just say the 14 @ - @ year @ - @ old swim@@ mer from China ' died like a pi@@ g ' " ? ? ? ?

A@@ I Yan@@ han of China in the Women 's 4 x 200m Fre@@ est@@ yle Re@@ lay Fin@@ al was described as : ' that little 14 @ - @ year @ - @ old from China dropped the ball , bab@@ y . '
criticism on T@@ wit@@ ter came th@@ ic@@ k and fast against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald with many calling him out
T@@ wit@@ ter users did not hold back when the heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ la@@ d was being
another T@@ wit@@ ter us@@ er , Sar@@ ah Par@@ adis , wrote : ' W@@ ow # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .

soon after , Scot@@ t Rus@@ sel who was hosting C@@ BC 's broadcast ap@@ olo@@ giz@@ ed on @ - @ air for Mac@@ Donald 's comment , saying : ' we ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ ze the comment on a sw@@ im performance made it to air . '

to make it even worse , she siz@@ ed up how she lo@@ oked in them , pe@@ ele@@ d them off and put them back on the shel@@ f .
she carried on bro@@ w@@ sing and eventually tried on four p@@ airs of under@@ we@@ ar at the st@@ ore in B@@ ou@@ ver@@ ie Pla@@ ce shop@@ ping centre , F@@ ol@@ k@@ est@@ one .

how to defend yo@@ ur@@ self from gun attacks using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
it 's a dangerous world out there , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ ma@@ il@@ .com might help make it a little saf@@ er for you .
we spoke to R@@ h@@ on M@@ iz@@ rac@@ hi , New York @ - @ based gr@@ and@@ mas@@ ter of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Federation , to find out how to deal with gun @ - @ tot@@ ing m@@ ug@@ gers at close range .
whether you 're appro@@ ac@@ hed from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tab@@ les on your m@@ ug@@ ger .
if appro@@ ac@@ hed from behind , M@@ iz@@ rac@@ hi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ er and ' clear the line of fire ' .
you then gr@@ as@@ p the gun between your fore@@ ar@@ m and sho@@ ul@@ der before hit@@ ting them in the face with your free el@@ bo@@ w .
a k@@ ne@@ e to the gro@@ in follows , and while the att@@ ack@@ er dou@@ ble@@ s up in p@@ ain , you tw@@ ist the gun from his hands , s@@ ma@@ ck him in the face with the bar@@ rel and back up , keeping the weap@@ on trained on him .
for gun@@ men appro@@ ac@@ hing from the front , it 's a similar tech@@ ni@@ que - get your body out of the line of fire , gra@@ b the gun and tw@@ ist it around so the villa@@ in can ' t fire .
at the same time , put we@@ ight on the gun and pun@@ ch the att@@ ack@@ er in the ch@@ est , then tw@@ ist the gun from his gri@@ p before backing up and poin@@ ting it at him .
so@@ unds tri@@ ck@@ y ?
chec@@ k the video to see exac@@ tly how M@@ iz@@ rac@@ hi does it .
but re@@ member that the saf@@ est way out of any m@@ ug@@ ging - if you 're not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a gr@@ and@@ mas@@ ter - is to hand over your cash .
travel@@ ler I@@ an W@@ right s@@ cr@@ ap@@ es his ton@@ gue along Europe 's dir@@ ti@@ est places for travel gu@@ ide
a British travel@@ ler has put his im@@ mun@@ e system and ga@@ g ref@@ le@@ x to a serious test - by lic@@ king some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing places in Europe .
pres@@ enter and travel writer I@@ an W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k , s@@ cr@@ ap@@ ed his ton@@ gue along a Euro note , a Pic@@ cad@@ il@@ ly C@@ ir@@ cus hand ra@@ il , a train to@@ il@@ et 's f@@ lus@@ h but@@ ton and a Russian public telephone to prove the streng@@ th of his im@@ mun@@ e system .
before lic@@ king each obj@@ ect , he used a lum@@ in@@ ome@@ ter to show himself , and us , just what he was getting in to .
but the exper@@ im@@ ent , which has be made into a film called The L@@ ic@@ k@@ hi@@ ker 's Gu@@ ide to In@@ ner Str@@ eng@@ th , thre@@ w up some sur@@ prising results .
the thought of lic@@ king a train 's f@@ lus@@ h but@@ ton used by thousands of other may be ut@@ ter@@ ly rep@@ el@@ l@@ ent , but in fact there are more bad bac@@ ter@@ ia in a kit@@ ch@@ en s@@ ink .
all the way along his trip through Europe , M@@ r W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gu@@ t bac@@ ter@@ ia and about his own health .
F@@ ort@@ un@@ ately , nothing he lic@@ ked left him with anything more than a bad tas@@ te in his m@@ outh .
M@@ r W@@ right became known for test@@ ing the dur@@ ability of his gu@@ t by travel@@ ling around the world and e@@ ating we@@ ir@@ d and won@@ der@@ ful things .
from public hand@@ ra@@ ils in train stations to a to@@ il@@ et f@@ lus@@ h but@@ ton the task defin@@ itely tes@@ ted his im@@ mun@@ e system
in the movie made about it he said : ' ever since I was a k@@ id I have been fair@@ ly car@@ ef@@ ree with my health and I 've put all sor@@ ts of things in my m@@ outh from so@@ il , e@@ ating wor@@ ms and mu@@ d@@ dy water . '
he certainly proved his rep@@ ut@@ ation during the film .
the only thing he turned down was a fil@@ th@@ y Russian public to@@ il@@ et .
his sa@@ mp@@ le s@@ wa@@ b showed a lum@@ in@@ ome@@ ter count of over 4@@ 000 units .
by compar@@ ison , fres@@ h@@ ly was@@ hed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one Russian public to@@ il@@ et he refused to lic@@ k after his lum@@ in@@ ome@@ ter count was over 4@@ 000 units , when fres@@ h@@ ly was@@ hed hands are less than 60
M@@ r W@@ right and Finnish da@@ ir@@ y producer Val@@ io have produced the travel@@ ler 's film called The L@@ ic@@ k@@ hi@@ ker 's Gu@@ ide to In@@ ner Str@@ eng@@ th which shows the bac@@ ter@@ ia count in different place like in the b@@ ath@@ room
he said in the film : ' that is close to one of the worst things I have s@@ me@@ l@@ led in a to@@ il@@ et . '
there 's nothing more dir@@ ty than that !
I 'm not going to lic@@ k anything because it 's dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing in there .
the L@@ ic@@ k@@ hi@@ ker 's Gu@@ ide to In@@ ner Str@@ eng@@ th was produced in con@@ jun@@ ction with Finnish da@@ ir@@ y producer Val@@ io .
the company provided M@@ r W@@ right with Val@@ io G@@ ef@@ il@@ us , which con@@ tain la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ ter@@ ia as well as v@@ it@@ am@@ ins C and D to help boost people 's gu@@ t bac@@ ter@@ ia and im@@ mun@@ e systems .
Val@@ io 's Sen@@ ior Vice President of sn@@ ac@@ ks , ju@@ ice and New categor@@ ies Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a said : ' we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fas@@ cin@@ ating to watch and at the same time expla@@ in the benefits of pro@@ bi@@ o@@ tics .
we did a lot of c@@ raz@@ y bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming that ended in the idea " let 's call I@@ an . "
they claim the interest in gu@@ t health is becoming a global phenom@@ enon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bac@@ ter@@ ia in our every@@ day environment , the importance of gu@@ t health and how it 's linked to the im@@ mun@@ e system .
growing interest in gu@@ t health is a global phenom@@ enon and with the docum@@ entary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interes@@ ting way .
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
T@@ om Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : ' let 's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for I@@ an if he had lic@@ ked some of the things I asked him to , like the dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing Russian to@@ il@@ et that 's shown in the film . '
n@@ atur@@ ally some things were easier to get I@@ an to lic@@ k , some were pre@@ t@@ ty tough .
I 'm g@@ la@@ d we got some of those dir@@ ty lic@@ ks caught on tap@@ e . '
in a survey conducted in 2015 by Val@@ io , 84 per cent of the respondents associ@@ ated la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ ter@@ ia specif@@ ically with the well @ - @ being of the sto@@ ma@@ ch and gu@@ t and 58 per cent said they use at least occas@@ ion@@ ally products con@@ taining added la@@ c@@ tic ac@@ id bac@@ ter@@ ia .
family of yo@@ bs destroyed S@@ alt@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all council house ahead of ev@@ ic@@ tion
a family of yo@@ bs left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were ev@@ ic@@ ted for terror@@ ising their neighbours .
T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner S@@ ha@@ un T@@ rebil@@ co@@ ck have been kicked out of the property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from the property , sho@@ cked housing associations officers found the property in a state of dis@@ rep@@ air .
the wal@@ ls were left with g@@ ap@@ ing ho@@ les , flo@@ or@@ bo@@ ards were ri@@ pped up , ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish was stre@@ wn over the flo@@ or and gra@@ ff@@ iti was da@@ ub@@ ed on the wal@@ ls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private ac@@ com@@ od@@ ation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , housing manager at Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing , said she f@@ ear@@ ed it might be beyond sav@@ ing .
she said : ' it 's been an absol@@ ute ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are for people down here and I don ' t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to we@@ igh up because this property will probably be known by the not @ - @ so @ - @ n@@ ice ele@@ ment of Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all .
this family are not@@ or@@ ious and their name is not@@ or@@ ious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property inter@@ mit@@ ten@@ tly and police say the reign of terror the family inf@@ lic@@ ted included fighting in the street with bas@@ eb@@ all b@@ ats , inti@@ mid@@ ating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and ex@@ cessive sh@@ ou@@ ting , arguing and swe@@ aring .
Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the ten@@ an@@ cy , was given an anti@@ social behavi@@ our order in June .
old ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish was found in a number of the ro@@ oms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished
flo@@ or bo@@ ards had been pul@@ led up in the property , from which drugs had been de@@ alt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regular@@ ly called
Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing ev@@ ic@@ ted her and her partner for@@ ce@@ fully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on volun@@ tar@@ ily .
the ev@@ ic@@ tion was hailed by reli@@ ev@@ ed neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hel@@ l .
one said : ' they didn ' t care about any@@ body . '
we lived next to them for 20 years and it 's always been bad .
the amount of times we 've seen the police down here is un@@ believ@@ able .
' T@@ his morning , we co@@ uldn ' t s@@ le@@ ep . '
we got up because it was so qu@@ iet here - we 're not used to that !
it 's going to be lov@@ ely now that they 're finally gone .
A@@ dam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing 's neighbour@@ hood enforcement manager , said the family failed to co@@ operate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regular@@ ly called to the property
ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish and old to@@ ys have been thro@@ wn down the over@@ gro@@ wn side of the council house
he added : ' it is a sha@@ me that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for the behavi@@ our of her and her family as ev@@ ic@@ tion is always the last course of action that Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all H@@ ous@@ ing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behavi@@ our was extre@@ me and their actions must have been ter@@ rif@@ ying for her neighbours to witness .
I appreci@@ ate all the work that has been put in by my team , Dev@@ on and Cor@@ n@@ w@@ all Police and members of the community who bra@@ vely came forward to give us information .

London scho@@ ol@@ gir@@ l who joined I@@ sil killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British scho@@ ol@@ gir@@ ls who left London last year to join I@@ sil , has reportedly died in Syria .
att@@ or@@ ney Tas@@ n@@ ime Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said her family lear@@ ned of her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria , a few weeks ago .
she was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group 's str@@ on@@ gh@@ old in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died just as she was making plans to fle@@ e the war @ - @ tor@@ n country and return to Britain .
" one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tom@@ b@@ stone and test@@ am@@ ent to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dis@@ su@@ ade people from ever making that choice really , " Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other scho@@ ol@@ gir@@ ls from e@@ ast London bo@@ ar@@ ded a f@@ light to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ t@@ ana 's family was told she mar@@ ried an I@@ sil figh@@ ter in Syria - and became a wi@@ dow within months .
Re@@ id says Clinton will sti@@ ck with Gar@@ land as Supreme Court nomin@@ e@@ e if elected
Sen@@ ate Democratic Le@@ ader Har@@ ry Re@@ id says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nomin@@ ate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land to the Supreme Court if she is elected president .
Sen@@ ate Repub@@ lic@@ ans have blocked Gar@@ land 's confir@@ mation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March .
Sen@@ ate Maj@@ ority Le@@ ader Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ el@@ l says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Anton@@ in S@@ cal@@ ia .
Re@@ id said on a conference call Thursday that he is predic@@ ting Clinton will pic@@ k Gar@@ land " with some degree of credi@@ bility . "
a spokeswoman for Re@@ id later said he had not spok@@ en to Clinton directly about whether she would nomin@@ ate Gar@@ land and was spec@@ ula@@ ting .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton 's team would not want to " rock the bo@@ at " with a new pic@@ k .
Gar@@ land is the chief judge for the U@@ . S@@ . Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the Distri@@ ct of C@@ olum@@ bia C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
Re@@ id said Repub@@ lic@@ ans who are blocking Gar@@ land 's nomin@@ ation are " min@@ ions " and " enab@@ lers " of Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ um@@ p .
he said Tr@@ um@@ p is un@@ f@@ it for office .

v@@ in@@ y@@ l destination : who is actually buying recor@@ ds ?
Lon@@ ely , middle @ - @ aged men love v@@ in@@ y@@ l .
before you r@@ ush to lit@@ ter the comments section with gn@@ arly ins@@ ults under the p@@ se@@ u@@ don@@ y@@ m N@@ ot@@ Al@@ l@@ Lon@@ el@@ y@@ M@@ id@@ d@@ le@@ A@@ ge@@ d@@ M@@ en , this statement der@@ i@@ ves from actual data .
according to Y@@ ou@@ G@@ ov , the much talk@@ ed @ - @ about record res@@ ur@@ gence is dri@@ ven not by a bo@@ om in mil@@ len@@ ni@@ als who want to em@@ br@@ ace the nov@@ el@@ ty of a phy@@ sical ite@@ m , but by mid@@ life nos@@ tal@@ g@@ ia .
those who have recently purch@@ ased a v@@ in@@ y@@ l al@@ bu@@ m are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 , appar@@ ently .
in fact , those in the 18 @ - @ 24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of ho@@ ar@@ ding by ho@@ b@@ b@@ y@@ ists , either - it has em@@ o@@ tional significance : ol@@ der v@@ in@@ y@@ l bu@@ yers are slightly more likely to keep their feel@@ ings to themselves ( 56 % ver@@ sus 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % ver@@ sus 66 % ) .
but are Y@@ ou@@ G@@ ov 's results true ?
if this blo@@ g was a tele@@ vised news report , the cam@@ era would follow me as I w@@ alk@@ ed down the middle of a b@@ us@@ y So@@ h@@ o street , we@@ aring a mode@@ st gre@@ y suit and ges@@ turing w@@ ild@@ ly before stop@@ ping , c@@ up@@ ping my hands and saying something author@@ it@@ ative like : " so , let 's take a look . "
so , let 's take a look .
while the heart of So@@ h@@ o is slow@@ ly being dra@@ ined of its char@@ m and gro@@ t - hotels , e@@ ats , Pre@@ ts and Pap@@ er@@ ch@@ as@@ es now f@@ ill the buildings once occup@@ ied by independent sel@@ lers - a hand@@ ful of fan@@ tas@@ tic speci@@ alist record shops still remain .
I '@@ d probably ask the cam@@ era to stop rol@@ ling for the next bit , in which I stand very close to various men in some of these sto@@ res and attempt to ga@@ uge their age and em@@ o@@ tional dis@@ position via ob@@ serv@@ ation .
G@@ las@@ we@@ gi@@ an Stu@@ art , 55 , whom I follow from S@@ ister R@@ ay ( data count : two young women , three middle @ - @ aged men ) into rec@@ k@@ less Rec@@ or@@ ds ( data count : eight middle @ - @ aged men , one woman , probably in her 20@@ s ) is in London for the after@@ no@@ on for a meeting and is per@@ using the shops to f@@ ill a few hours .
is he a collec@@ tor , I ask ?
" I sup@@ pose I am , " he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 recor@@ ds .
these recor@@ ds , pic@@ tured above ( he e@@ ma@@ iled me the sn@@ ap , I didn ' t follow him home ) , line his living room wal@@ ls .
his reason for acqu@@ iring such a v@@ ast number of al@@ b@@ ums and sing@@ les is part@@ ly a result of his dis@@ pos@@ able income : he is now able to buy recor@@ ds he co@@ uldn ' t affor@@ d when they originally came out , and to re@@ purchase items he sold when he was young and sk@@ int .
" a lot of the stu@@ ff I get is late 6@@ 0s , early 7@@ 0s , things that came out when I was 11 or 12 , things I was probably a bit too young to get , " he says .
he agrees that those who purchase recor@@ ds are more likely to be intro@@ ver@@ ts who like their own company , adding : " I don ' t sm@@ oke , I don ' t dr@@ ink very much .
it 's my vice .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister R@@ ay , also believes that many of the customers he en@@ coun@@ ters f@@ it the Y@@ ou@@ G@@ ov profile .
he has , however , no@@ tic@@ ed a new wave of people influ@@ enced by the media hy@@ pe , people who heard about the co@@ me@@ back and felt comp@@ elled to buy back their old recor@@ ds .
from con@@ vers@@ ations I 've had , people have got rid of their collection , nor@@ m@@ ally around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their v@@ in@@ y@@ l to buy C@@ D@@ s are now selling their C@@ D@@ s to buy their recor@@ ds back , " he says .
that may expla@@ in a bo@@ om in v@@ in@@ y@@ l revi@@ v@@ alists of a certain age .
but what about the alleged em@@ o@@ tional importance of recor@@ ds ?
it takes a few secon@@ ds in a shop such as P@@ hon@@ ica to realise that record sto@@ res offer a com@@ for@@ ting community of lik@@ emin@@ ded ty@@ pes .
according to We@@ z , some ol@@ der customers have taken um@@ bra@@ ge with the cont@@ ac@@ t@@ less payment system in particular .
some v@@ in@@ y@@ l fans may feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by the digital world and choose to re@@ tre@@ at to the stability of the fam@@ ili@@ ar record s@@ le@@ eve , of items that rec@@ all hal@@ c@@ yon te@@ en@@ age mem@@ ories .
" I think sometimes it can be fil@@ ling a vo@@ id or having material pos@@ ses@@ sions as some kind of com@@ for@@ t , " We@@ z says .
as a collec@@ tor my@@ self , I have that , and I think a lot of people do .
it 's an easy way to occup@@ y your head@@ space .
" we 're like their social workers ! " pip@@ es up a co @ - @ wor@@ ker from a st@@ ack of recor@@ ds .
an IC@@ M poll in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a v@@ in@@ y@@ l al@@ bu@@ m the previous month had yet to lis@@ ten to it .
the poll also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase v@@ in@@ y@@ l don ' t own a record player .
at this stage of the news report , I would probably be looking gra@@ vely concerned while f@@ lic@@ king through a st@@ ack of bos@@ sa n@@ ova comp@@ il@@ ations .
the " tro@@ ph@@ y " as@@ pect of the revi@@ val is something that Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in S@@ oun@@ ds of the Uni@@ ver@@ se ( data count : three mid@@ de @ - @ aged men ) has no@@ tic@@ ed .
" someone came in recently and said : " I don ' t have a record player , but I want to buy a Radi@@ o@@ head record so we can put it on our shel@@ f , " " he says .
that 's not a large percentage , but it 's defin@@ itely happen@@ ing .
more of the product side , less of the music .
we have people saying : " I don ' t have a record player . "
that 's youn@@ ger people , not ol@@ der ones , late te@@ ens who are just getting into it .
F@@ op@@ p , which now dedi@@ cates almost an entire flo@@ or to v@@ in@@ y@@ l , has a far more var@@ ied audience when I arrive .
there are cou@@ ples in their 7@@ 0s , tourists taking ph@@ otos , te@@ en@@ age boys and middle @ - @ aged women .
while the atmosphere is less at ease than the af@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned sto@@ res - W@@ ild Be@@ ast 's latest syn@@ th - and se@@ x @ - @ fu@@ elled pop , rather than no@@ od@@ ling jazz , is b@@ lasting from the speak@@ ers - it is good to see di@@ versity in its customers .
none of them look particularly l@@ on@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ ging psych@@ ological tra@@ uma is hard to as@@ certain by standing next to someone for 30 secon@@ ds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been w@@ alk@@ ing around F@@ op@@ p for a few minutes , looking at the vari@@ ety of recor@@ ds on sale .
she is win@@ dow @ - @ shop@@ ping , rather than on a spending sp@@ ree .
she doesn ' t ear@@ n a lot , she says , so collec@@ ting recor@@ ds is@@ n ' t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it 's easy to lis@@ ten to music by a computer or another way , but the be@@ a@@ uty of v@@ in@@ y@@ l is ... " she dri@@ f@@ ts off into a lov@@ est@@ ru@@ ck si@@ gh .
I don ' t know how to expla@@ in - it 's really unique .
my last stop is a shop said to have in@@ sp@@ ired a fresh generation of v@@ in@@ y@@ l lov@@ ers : urban O@@ ut@@ f@@ it@@ ters .
while giving the illu@@ sion of per@@ using the den@@ im ho@@ t p@@ ants , I obser@@ ve a group of te@@ en@@ age gir@@ ls , who cl@@ us@@ ter around the Pol@@ ar@@ o@@ id cam@@ er@@ as mom@@ entar@@ ily , before a da@@ d and his da@@ ughter de@@ liber@@ ate purch@@ asing a C@@ ros@@ ley record player .
to the left is a st@@ air@@ well , a w@@ all of which is stac@@ ked with recor@@ ds by A@@ de@@ le , J@@ ef@@ f Buc@@ k@@ ley , A@@ my W@@ in@@ e@@ house and F@@ le@@ et@@ wood M@@ ac : a mi@@ x of con@@ temporary and clas@@ si@@ cs , the essential recor@@ ds for any average collection .
nobody is looking - perhaps because they are mer@@ ely de@@ cor@@ ation , some so high up the w@@ all that it would be impossible to tou@@ ch them .
it is p@@ ure " art v@@ in@@ y@@ l . "
but , given that any attr@@ action to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the dep@@ ths of So@@ h@@ o for more , there is little to compla@@ in about .
it is no surprise that a demo@@ graphic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that sp@@ ends the most on lu@@ x@@ ury items such as v@@ in@@ y@@ l .
but while my findings suggest Y@@ ou@@ G@@ ov 's results are ac@@ cur@@ ate , in So@@ h@@ o record sto@@ res at least , they do not dis@@ count the huge number of female collec@@ tors and v@@ in@@ y@@ l lov@@ ers that exist in reality , in record shops and on online for@@ ums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they are certainly not spending their Thursday mor@@ nings lo@@ iter@@ ing around the record shops of Ber@@ w@@ ic@@ k Street , f@@ lic@@ king through recor@@ ds and avoi@@ ding the gaz@@ e of a cre@@ ep@@ y , 30 @ - @ year @ - @ old fak@@ e television pres@@ enter who is lo@@ oming over the sho@@ ul@@ ders of un@@ suspec@@ ting middle @ - @ aged men .

French court rej@@ ects bid to dem@@ ol@@ ish shops at Jun@@ gle refugee camp
a French court has rejected a bid by Cal@@ a@@ is authorities to dem@@ ol@@ ish dozens of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaur@@ ants in the Jun@@ gle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , Cal@@ a@@ is authorities had argued the state should be able to kno@@ ck down a total of 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ et@@ tes to energy dr@@ in@@ ks , offer ha@@ ir@@ cuts , or sell te@@ a for 50 c@@ ents ( 4@@ 0@@ p ) or basic me@@ als for a few euros in mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft restaur@@ ants .
the Cal@@ a@@ is pre@@ f@@ ect 's office argued the places should be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and san@@ itation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaur@@ ants were vital , saying the free me@@ als offered by a state @ - @ backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops and restaur@@ ants often provided shel@@ ter and free me@@ als to those in need .
a L@@ il@@ le court ruled there was no legal basis for exp@@ el@@ ling the people running the 72 mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shops , but said the Cal@@ a@@ is pre@@ f@@ ect 's concerns " were tot@@ ally under@@ stan@@ dable . "
the judge , Jean @ - @ Fran@@ ço@@ is Mol@@ la , said the gro@@ cer@@ ies , caf@@ es and restaur@@ ants played a much bigger role than simply fe@@ eding people that " live in extremely prec@@ ar@@ ious conditions . "
he said the sp@@ ac@@ es provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunte@@ ers .
one of the places that had been under threat from dem@@ ol@@ ition was the camp 's Jun@@ gle Book Ki@@ ds " C@@ af@@ e which is run not @ - @ for @ - @ profit and provides 200 me@@ als a day , English and French cl@@ ass@@ es , and asylum ad@@ vice for the hundreds of vulnerable un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed a petition to protect the ki@@ ds " caf@@ e .
a letter sent to the Guardian said its closure " would be a cat@@ astro@@ p@@ he for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . "
two char@@ ities , Hel@@ p Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es and L ' A@@ ub@@ er@@ ge des M@@ ig@@ rants , on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jun@@ gle camp have ris@@ en to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest ever - after a ste@@ ep increase in arri@@ v@@ als during the summer .
Britain set@@ tle for silver in ru@@ g@@ by se@@ ven@@ s after Fi@@ ji mas@@ ter@@ class sees them take gold
great Britain 's impres@@ sive run in the ru@@ g@@ by 7@@ s was brought to a cr@@ ash@@ ing halt at the final hur@@ dle by Fi@@ ji in the final on Thursday night when they were compre@@ hen@@ sively be@@ aten 43 @ - @ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Sta@@ di@@ um here in R@@ io .
Fi@@ ji gave a mas@@ ter@@ class in hand@@ ling , off @ - @ lo@@ ad@@ ing , side @ - @ ste@@ pping , support play , running lines and bru@@ te streng@@ th to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any col@@ our .
defeat came with the non @ - @ too sha@@ b@@ by con@@ so@@ lation of silver - Britain 's third of the day - and they could be pro@@ ud of their efforts in the inaug@@ ural Olympic 7@@ s tournament in which they beat New Ze@@ al@@ and , Ar@@ gen@@ t@@ ina and South Africa along the way .
the bru@@ ising be@@ ating of the B@@ oks , 7 @ - @ 5 in the se@@ mi @ - @ final earlier in the day , may have come back to bi@@ te them in the final .
but , regardless , Fi@@ ji on this form would have be@@ aten a f@@ it as a f@@ iddle 15 @ - @ man team .
it may be some con@@ so@@ lation to G@@ B - but probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his nec@@ k tom@@ or@@ row : Fi@@ ji 's head coach is B@@ en R@@ yan , the former Eng@@ land bos@@ s from W@@ im@@ ble@@ don .
it has been some jour@@ ney for G@@ B .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost every game at the A@@ de@@ la@@ ide S@@ ev@@ ens .
here , they lost just one .
this ham@@ mer@@ ing will hur@@ t but the progress is start@@ ling .
Fi@@ ji started ma@@ g@@ nific@@ ently , bo@@ unc@@ ing off G@@ B tack@@ les for f@@ un .
it was like running into a series of moving b@@ uses for cap@@ tain T@@ om Mit@@ ch@@ el@@ l and co and the World Ser@@ ies champ@@ ions went 5 @ - @ 0 up when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au di@@ ved over in the cor@@ ner .
with four minutes on the clock Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another down the right wing , which was con@@ ver@@ ted .
12 @ - @ 0 and G@@ B had har@@ dly tou@@ ched the ball .
a super@@ b Mit@@ ch@@ el@@ l tackle stopped the man @ - @ moun@@ tain Le@@ one N@@ akar@@ aw@@ a from s@@ cor@@ ing a third but it was only delay@@ ing Fi@@ ji .
on seven minutes J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a tou@@ ched down in the right cor@@ ner and G@@ B were 17 @ - @ 0 to the bad .
N@@ akar@@ aw@@ a added another from the re@@ start and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
V@@ a@@ tem@@ o R@@ av@@ ou@@ vo@@ u then bur@@ st through some more lim@@ p G@@ B tack@@ ling and stor@@ med to the line to score .
the con@@ version made it 29 @ - @ 0 at the break .
it was as if Fi@@ ji had been born to play 7@@ s , while G@@ B are still lear@@ ning the trade .
which is pre@@ t@@ ty much how it is .
G@@ B made wh@@ o@@ le@@ sale changes at half @ - @ time and they p@@ lu@@ g@@ ged the Fi@@ j@@ ian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first @ - @ half standards was good , until Jos@@ u@@ a Tu@@ is@@ ova went over after some br@@ il@@ li@@ ant Fi@@ j@@ ian inter@@ play .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on gra@@ bbed a try for G@@ B , tou@@ ching down in the left cor@@ ner to make it 36 @ - @ 7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Is@@ lan@@ ders whose fans san@@ g , w@@ av@@ ed fla@@ gs and dan@@ ced in the stands .
it was hard not to ad@@ m@@ ire Fi@@ ji 's whole j@@ oy@@ ful approach .
M@@ ata V@@ ili@@ ame ic@@ ed the Fi@@ j@@ ian c@@ ake that didn ' t need ic@@ ing with another try in the d@@ ying mom@@ ents .
the wh@@ ist@@ le went , the Fi@@ j@@ ians em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed and G@@ B hit the tur@@ f , thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly be@@ aten .
earlier in the day , Fi@@ ji had be@@ aten Japan 20 @ - @ 5 in their se@@ mi @ - @ final and G@@ B ed@@ ged South Africa in a ti@@ ght se@@ mi @ - @ final of one try each - Britain 's con@@ version the difference .
K@@ yle Bro@@ wn put the B@@ oks ahead in the first half but Dan N@@ ort@@ on with some da@@ z@@ z@@ ling foot@@ work broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant late tackle from Mar@@ cus Wat@@ son , bro@@ ther of Eng@@ land 's 15 @ - @ aside team , An@@ th@@ ony , sec@@ ured the win - and ulti@@ mately the silver medal .
H@@ ele@@ n G@@ l@@ over and He@@ ather Stan@@ ning in@@ sp@@ ired to ro@@ wing victory by coach 's cancer battle
there will not be a more em@@ o@@ tive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stro@@ ke to the last , 2@@ 20 pun@@ ishing heav@@ es into history , H@@ ele@@ n G@@ l@@ over and He@@ ather Stan@@ ning found added mean@@ ing in their gol@@ den moment at the E@@ stac@@ io da L@@ ag@@ o@@ a .
though they were the two pul@@ ling on the o@@ ars , there were three voic@@ es in that bo@@ at , the ech@@ o of coach R@@ ob@@ in Wil@@ liam@@ s ever present as they pow@@ ered to a second suc@@ cessive Olympic gold in the women 's p@@ airs , the first fem@@ al@@ es in the ann@@ als of British s@@ port to scale such a he@@ ight .
their domin@@ ance was absol@@ ute , after all this was their 3@@ 9th ou@@ ting un@@ be@@ aten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two br@@ il@@ li@@ ant athletes s@@ kat@@ ing over the sur@@ face with the ele@@ g@@ ance of sw@@ ans , does not wh@@ ol@@ ly reflect the nature of the tri@@ ump@@ h .
behind every ro@@ wing gold is a bat@@ tal@@ ion of willing hands contribut@@ ing the incre@@ mental gain@@ s that make the difference , and no hands were more instr@@ um@@ ental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when di@@ agnos@@ ed with cancer .
as he said , it was tou@@ ch and go .
I had bla@@ d@@ der cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don ' t it goes every@@ where .
it would have been a pre@@ t@@ ty bad situation .
it al@@ ters your outlook a bit .
Wil@@ liam@@ s was di@@ agnos@@ ed in December 2013 .
the tri@@ o were fortun@@ ate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the dis@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in hospital and I was w@@ alk@@ ing around the ward - 20@@ ft , 30@@ ft 5@@ 0@@ ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that 's how it star@@ ts off .
ro@@ wing in itself is a jour@@ ney but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first th@@ ou@@ ghts were for Wil@@ liam@@ s , who had spent a ner@@ v@@ y morning talking a little more than us@@ ual in an attempt to process his own an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ties .
Stan@@ ning , a cap@@ tain in the R@@ oy@@ al arti@@ l@@ lery reg@@ im@@ ent with a tour of Afghanistan behind her , said " I 've been an em@@ o@@ tional w@@ rec@@ k this week , may@@ be that 's a bit extre@@ me , but it means such a lot . "
it just reiter@@ ates how much this means to me , how much me and H@@ ele@@ n have worked and R@@ ob@@ in as well .
it 's been a fan@@ tas@@ tic three years back with H@@ ele@@ n and R@@ ob@@ in .
without R@@ ob@@ in we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he 's the best coach in the world .
I co@@ uldn ' t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
H@@ ele@@ n G@@ l@@ over and He@@ ather Stan@@ ning ha@@ ven ' t lost a race in five years .
the p@@ air set a pun@@ ishing r@@ hy@@ th@@ m that their ri@@ v@@ als could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the cre@@ ws from New Ze@@ al@@ and and Den@@ mark began to close , Stan@@ ning and G@@ l@@ over had too much in reser@@ ve .
we were very much in the moment .
H@@ ele@@ n was calling ' stay in the process , stay in the process ' .
it 's really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we w@@ eren ' t looking to do anything amaz@@ ing .
we w@@ eren ' t looking for fi@@ re@@ works today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the p@@ air will take a year before deci@@ ding their fut@@ ures .
G@@ l@@ over has a w@@ ed@@ ding to attend next month , her own to television adv@@ ent@@ u@@ rer Ste@@ ve B@@ ack@@ shall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn ' t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this fe@@ els so much better , " she said .

Bulgaria Pos@@ ts In@@ f@@ lation for 1st T@@ ime in 8 Mon@@ ths
inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July , national statistics show .
this is the highest value in years ( since June 2012 ) and the first one above zer@@ o since October of last year when a positive 0.@@ 2 % was pos@@ ted .
the annual average inflation , meas@@ ured by C@@ PI , in the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 20@@ 16 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consu@@ mer price index in July 20@@ 16 compared to June 20@@ 16 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 20@@ 16 compared to December 2015 ) has been -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 20@@ 16 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .

S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at " An@@ ime " E@@ ff@@ ect I@@ s cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed as Asi@@ an Car@@ ic@@ ature
S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at says this fil@@ ter is in@@ sp@@ ired by an@@ ime , but some observers say it 's rac@@ ially in@@ sensitive .
with its len@@ s to@@ ol , S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at allows some 150 million daily users to al@@ ter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn yo@@ ur@@ self into a p@@ in@@ e@@ app@@ le , a do@@ g or a charac@@ ter be@@ f@@ it@@ ting a Ro@@ y L@@ ic@@ h@@ ten@@ ste@@ in pain@@ ting .
the len@@ ses are b@@ l@@ un@@ t , feature @ - @ war@@ ping to@@ ols that gener@@ ate more than 30 million enhan@@ ced sel@@ fi@@ es a day .
any mis@@ steps quickly enter the public record .
S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at len@@ ses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the ap@@ p was promoting bla@@ ck@@ face or encouraging wh@@ it@@ ened s@@ kin ton@@ es as an ideal of be@@ a@@ uty .
so when it pus@@ hed a len@@ s to some users this week that gave them s@@ lan@@ ted ey@@ es , dist@@ or@@ ted te@@ eth and pu@@ ff@@ y che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ an people - " yel@@ low@@ face . "
and they won@@ dered if these repe@@ ated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with di@@ versity .
the news and the ou@@ tra@@ ge went wide on Wednesday , with reports by The ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at said it had dis@@ man@@ tled the feature .
the company offered an ex@@ plan@@ ation : the len@@ s was meant as ho@@ ma@@ ge to an@@ ime charac@@ ters , not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ an people .
but for observers who have experienced rac@@ ism , the len@@ s remin@@ ded them of hur@@ t@@ ful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ pes in action .
others roun@@ dly rejected the an@@ ime compar@@ ison .
in an e@@ mail , gr@@ ace S@@ par@@ ap@@ ani , a Ko@@ re@@ an American art student whose t@@ we@@ et about the ph@@ otos was widely shared , said that the len@@ s was " hur@@ t@@ ful and un@@ com@@ for@@ table to say the least . "
she added that " it 's hard to argue with the side by side compar@@ ison of the very gr@@ os@@ s Asi@@ an car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ ter 's effects .
it shows that the fil@@ ter is@@ n ' t just yel@@ low@@ face , but yel@@ low@@ face taken to its der@@ og@@ atory extre@@ me .
S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at is not the only company to cross these cultural tri@@ p@@ wi@@ res .
American culture seems involved in an end@@ less struggle over di@@ versity and inclu@@ sion , from corpor@@ ate bo@@ ard@@ ro@@ oms to Hol@@ ly@@ wood and the dev@@ ices we all carry in our hands .
and S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at 's huge audience of youn@@ ger people - who are more rac@@ ially di@@ ver@@ se than their ol@@ der counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensi@@ tivity .
when one of S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at 's len@@ ses cre@@ ates an image that is ins@@ ul@@ ting to a us@@ er , 25 @ - @ year @ - @ old K@@ ati@@ e Z@@ h@@ u said in an interview on Thursday , " it 's much har@@ der for these ty@@ pes of things to go un@@ no@@ tic@@ ed like they did before . "
on Thursday , M@@ s@@ . Z@@ h@@ u , a product manager and engine@@ er who works for Medi@@ um , decided to de@@ le@@ te her S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an es@@ say for Medi@@ um and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race @ - @ related controversi@@ es reflec@@ ted a lack of di@@ versity in h@@ iring practices at S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at .
M@@ s@@ . Z@@ h@@ u cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed the company 's mostly wh@@ ite , all @ - @ mal@@ e leadership and ended her es@@ say with a h@@ ash@@ ta@@ g : # D@@ ele@@ te@@ S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at .
" it 's either that they had no di@@ ver@@ se representation of people of col@@ or on their staff to the point where they 're able to make decisions like this , " M@@ s@@ . Z@@ h@@ u , who is Chinese @ - @ American , said , " or they do have some people of col@@ or who are working there , but they 're not on positions where they feel safe or com@@ for@@ table to speak up . "
other observers share her view , a compla@@ int that S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at has left largely un@@ ans@@ w@@ ered .
the company does not release figures about di@@ versity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on Thursday , S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at declined to discuss the rac@@ ial back@@ grounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hi@@ red a rec@@ ru@@ i@@ ter to focus on under@@ represented pop@@ ulations and on driving inclu@@ sion efforts inter@@ n@@ ally .
for her part , M@@ s@@ . Z@@ h@@ u said she would keep her S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at account closed , adding , " I won@@ der if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O@@ . K@@ . "
military O@@ ffici@@ als dist@@ or@@ ted Is@@ is In@@ tel@@ ligence , Con@@ gres@@ sional Pan@@ el S@@ ays
officials from the United States Central Com@@ m@@ and alter@@ ed intelligence reports to por@@ tra@@ y a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground war@@ ran@@ ted , a con@@ gres@@ sional panel said in a report issued Thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the Repub@@ lican chair@@ men of the House Ar@@ med Ser@@ vices Committee , In@@ tel@@ ligence Committee and Def@@ en@@ se Ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ations S@@ ub@@ committee , found " widespread dis@@ satisfaction " among Central Com@@ m@@ and intelligence analysts , who said su@@ peri@@ ors were doc@@ tor@@ ing their assess@@ ments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State .
central Com@@ m@@ and , known as CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , F@@ la . , that over@@ sees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia .
" intelligence products approved by senior CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM leaders ty@@ pic@@ ally provided a more positive dep@@ ic@@ tion of U@@ . S@@ . anti@@ terrorism efforts than was war@@ ran@@ ted by facts on the ground and were cons@@ ist@@ ently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , " a news release about the report said .
" what happened at CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM is unacceptable - our war figh@@ ters su@@ ffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , " said Representative K@@ en Cal@@ ver@@ t , Repub@@ lican of C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia .
the leadership fail@@ ures at CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM reach to the very top of the organiz@@ ation .
the 10 @ - @ page report deta@@ iled per@@ s@@ istent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Com@@ m@@ and 's descri@@ ption and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces .
although it offers no defin@@ iti@@ ve evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doc@@ to@@ red , it describ@@ es analysts as feel@@ ing as though they were under pressure from CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as Is@@ is or I@@ sil .
" throughout the first half of 2015 , many Central Com@@ m@@ and press rele@@ as@@ es , statements and con@@ gres@@ sional testimon@@ ies were significantly more positive than actual events , " the report said .
for example , a CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM official stated publicly that a major military assa@@ ult to take back Mos@@ ul could begin as early as April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , Iraq 's second @ - @ largest city , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
" after months of investigation , this much is very clear , " Representative Mik@@ e P@@ om@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican of Kan@@ sas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the United States Central Com@@ m@@ and 's most senior intelligence leaders manip@@ ulated the command 's intelligence products to down@@ play the threat from Is@@ is in Iraq .
Repub@@ lic@@ ans created the task force after lear@@ ning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manip@@ ulated .
the report released Thursday is to be followed up by more exten@@ sive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM intelligence by the Department of Def@@ en@@ se inspec@@ tor general .
Democratic members of the House In@@ tel@@ ligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclu@@ sions of the Repub@@ lican task force .
" between 2014 and 2015 , CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM created an over@@ ly in@@ su@@ lar process for produc@@ ing intelligence assess@@ ments on I@@ sil and Iraqi Security Forces , " Representative A@@ dam B@@ . S@@ chi@@ ff , the committee 's top Democr@@ at , said in a statement .
this process , Mr@@ . S@@ chi@@ ff said , " stal@@ led the release of intelligence products , " hur@@ t mor@@ ale among analysts and " in@@ su@@ ffici@@ ently accommo@@ dated dis@@ s@@ enting views . "
but Mr@@ . S@@ chi@@ ff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM analysts to f@@ it their conclu@@ sions to a " pre@@ set or political nar@@ r@@ ative . "
the preliminary results of the con@@ gres@@ sional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , The New York Times reported the existence of the P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on inspec@@ tor general investigation , opened after complaints by CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM analysts .
L@@ t@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patri@@ ck Ev@@ ans , a P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on spokesman , said in a statement that the Def@@ en@@ se Department would not comment on the con@@ gres@@ sional report while the inspec@@ tor general 's investigation continued .
but he said that " experts sometimes dis@@ agree on the interpre@@ tation of complex data , and the intelligence community and Department of Def@@ en@@ se welcome health@@ y dialogue on these vital national security topics . "
the investigation has re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions beyond the question of whether the American @ - @ led bomb@@ ing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succe@@ eding ( an as@@ ser@@ tion now made by a growing number of Def@@ en@@ se officials ) .
but last year 's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Com@@ m@@ and for hon@@ est assess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis sp@@ ots .
the cri@@ ti@@ ques on the Islamic State intelligence mir@@ ror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM intelligence analyst , Gre@@ gory Ho@@ ok@@ er , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush , over many analysts " objections , advo@@ cated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thin@@ king about what would follow the 2003 inv@@ asion .
Mr@@ . Ho@@ ok@@ er also played a key part in the in@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion over the Islamic State intelligence .
last year , officials said , Mr@@ . Ho@@ ok@@ er 's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , air@@ strikes against Islamic State @ - @ held refin@@ er@@ ies had not significantly weak@@ ened the terrorist group 's finan@@ ces because it had built mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft refin@@ er@@ ies to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distribu@@ ted outside Central Com@@ m@@ and , The Times reported in September .
CE@@ N@@ T@@ C@@ OM 's commander then , Gen@@ . L@@ lo@@ y@@ d J@@ . A@@ us@@ tin I@@ II , came under criticism last year after Sen@@ ate testimon@@ y viewed by many lawmakers as being an over@@ ly positive assessment of the war .
General A@@ us@@ tin retired in April and was replaced at Central Com@@ m@@ and by Gen@@ . Jos@@ ep@@ h L@@ . Vo@@ tel .
U@@ . S@@ . W@@ ins 4th stra@@ ight in Women 's Fi@@ eld H@@ oc@@ key , setting U@@ p S@@ how@@ down W@@ ith Britain
one day after s@@ cor@@ ing three goals in a 6 @ - @ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ ati@@ e B@@ A@@ M scored the first two goals for the United States women 's field ho@@ c@@ key team on Thursday as the Americ@@ ans defeated India , 3 @ - @ 0 .
five goals in two games should be a mem@@ or@@ able fe@@ at , but B@@ A@@ M , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
" I have no clu@@ e , " she said .
I 'm not really one of those people who ke@@ ep@@ s track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the Americ@@ ans are 4 @ - @ 0 in the Olympic tournament and are ti@@ ed for first place in their group with Britain , which remained un@@ be@@ aten after defe@@ ating Japan , 2 @ - @ 0 , on Thursday .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have quali@@ fied for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who fin@@ is@@ hes first in their six @ - @ team br@@ ac@@ ket and who fin@@ is@@ hes second .
the first @ - @ place fin@@ is@@ her will avoid the powerful Dutch , the leaders of the other br@@ ac@@ ket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however Saturday 's game tur@@ ns out , the Americ@@ ans have created a sti@@ r with their sur@@ prising run here , four years after fin@@ ishing last among 12 teams at the London Games .
B@@ A@@ M was on that team .
she grew up in B@@ lu@@ e Bel@@ l , PA . , first pic@@ ked up a field ho@@ c@@ key sti@@ ck when she was 3 ( her tw@@ in ol@@ der s@@ ist@@ ers played the s@@ port at D@@ re@@ x@@ el ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youn@@ gest player ever .
she mis@@ sed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final ros@@ ter .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her te@@ am@@ ma@@ tes .
the next year , C@@ rai@@ g Par@@ n@@ ham , an Eng@@ lis@@ h@@ man , was named the coach , and things began to change .
" a cultural change , a mental change , a phy@@ sical change , " B@@ A@@ M said .
we didn ' t have the work rate in London that we have now .
we 've made a complete turn@@ around .
on Thursday night , B@@ A@@ M opened the s@@ cor@@ ing in the first half with a back@@ hand shot from close in .
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and kept the score 1 @ - @ 0 until late in the third period , when B@@ A@@ M took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then cur@@ led into the middle and wh@@ ip@@ ped the ball into the goal to give the Americ@@ ans a 2 @ - @ 0 lead .
M@@ el@@ is@@ sa G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez added the final goal mid@@ way through the fourth period .
the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the United States go@@ al@@ ie , J@@ ack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three vic@@ tories .
she is on a rol@@ l .
so is B@@ A@@ M .
" we 're in a good place right now , " Par@@ n@@ ham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday 's game .
amid the fur@@ y of the Olympics , the Z@@ en of the Tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine
wher@@ ever you are , whatever time it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in R@@ io de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o feel constan@@ t and in@@ es@@ capable , a fur@@ ious rela@@ y of competition and stri@@ ving .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself were a f@@ lam@@ ing bat@@ on , passed from ar@@ cher to swim@@ mer to gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast to tri@@ athle@@ te .
you can ' t turn on a television , read a newspaper or lis@@ ten in on your neigh@@ b@@ or 's con@@ vers@@ ation in a co@@ ffe@@ e @ - @ shop line without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ ati@@ e L@@ edec@@ k@@ y or the fe@@ ud between Michael P@@ hel@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ lo@@ s .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ o@@ ley .
Mr@@ . Do@@ o@@ ley , a first @ - @ time Olymp@@ ian and a di@@ mp@@ led he@@ art@@ thro@@ b in the making , may well be among those hous@@ eh@@ old names being sho@@ w@@ cas@@ ed in prime time , bu@@ oy@@ ed by sponsor@@ ships and feel @ - @ good TV commer@@ ci@@ als , if he were a swim@@ mer , a gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast or even a f@@ en@@ cer .
but Mr@@ . Do@@ o@@ ley , 28 , of L@@ ake Fo@@ rest , Cal@@ if . , is competing for the gold in Olympic tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine .
the Olympic fla@@ me does not ill@@ um@@ in@@ ate each event equ@@ ally .
further from the cen@@ ter , part@@ ly in sha@@ dow , are those sports not uni@@ vers@@ ally acknowledged : air @ - @ p@@ ist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , b@@ ad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the bre@@ ast@@ stro@@ ke , and long may it reign .
but if I may make a mode@@ st case for my particular fav@@ or@@ ite , let me call attention to the dis@@ cre@@ et char@@ m of the tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine .
though tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it de@@ bu@@ ted at the Sy@@ d@@ ney Games , it has spent the interven@@ ing 16 years so bar@@ ely acknowledged that many I survey@@ ed did not real@@ ize it was an Olympic s@@ port at all .
this may be a regional ig@@ nor@@ ance .
despite sending athletes to compete , the United States has never won a medal in tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine and did not have an athle@@ te advance to the finals until 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russi@@ ans ten@@ d to split the pri@@ z@@ es for the men , and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong of China and Ros@@ ie Mac@@ L@@ en@@ nan of Canada will be def@@ ending their London gold medals this year .
but there is an under@@ do@@ g char@@ m to tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine , in part because it so@@ unds , to the un@@ en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed e@@ ar , f@@ it@@ ter for c@@ lo@@ wn colle@@ ge than the Olympics .
here I should con@@ fes@@ s that I am no expert , just an earth@@ bo@@ und en@@ thu@@ si@@ ast .
it does have com@@ ic potential - the car@@ to@@ on qu@@ av@@ er of its never @ - @ ending boun@@ ce - but also the gr@@ ace of gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics and di@@ ving , the two sports it essen@@ ti@@ ally combin@@ es .
the word " tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine " der@@ i@@ ves from the Spanish el tra@@ m@@ pol@@ í@@ n , mean@@ ing " di@@ ving board . "
aspir@@ ing champ@@ ions jum@@ p on a giant tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine , shooting up to nearly 30 fe@@ et in the air , and are called upon to perform a series of t@@ umb@@ ling moves ( tw@@ ists , p@@ ik@@ es and som@@ er@@ sa@@ ults ) before eventually lan@@ ding on their fe@@ et .
they are ju@@ dged on ex@@ ec@@ ution , difficul@@ ty and " f@@ light time , " according to the official Olympic program .
thir@@ ty @ - @ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in R@@ io .
the most common Olympic v@@ ec@@ tor is stra@@ ight ahead .
medal hop@@ eful@@ s must go far@@ ther , fas@@ ter , up and over , in their qu@@ est for gold , sometimes to the finish , other times back and for@@ th up and down the court .
they are ch@@ asing not only the finish line or the starting w@@ all but also , in the tele@@ vised cover@@ age , another ta@@ un@@ ting line : that of the world , or Olympic , record .
this single @ - @ min@@ ded pursu@@ it is no@@ ble , ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to bring even a spec@@ t@@ ator to te@@ ars .
but it is also what I find slightly ex@@ ha@@ ust@@ ing about even wat@@ ching the Games .
from this , tra@@ m@@ pol@@ ine offers a res@@ p@@ ite .
the tra@@ m@@ pol@@ in@@ er 's v@@ ec@@ tor is up .
forward motion is not the goal .
he or she re@@ bo@@ unds , seem@@ ing weigh@@ t@@ less as an as@@ tron@@ a@@ ut , going up , then down , then effor@@ t@@ les@@ s@@ ly up again .
it is not without competition , of course , nor without difficul@@ ty , but for the dur@@ ation of a rout@@ ine , there is no f@@ ran@@ tic charge to@@ ward the end , no va@@ ul@@ ting into the dist@@ ance , just the dre@@ am@@ y , gr@@ ac@@ eful suspen@@ sion of time and gra@@ v@@ ity .
it is as close to Z@@ en as Olympic competition gets .
the women 's quali@@ fi@@ ers and then finals will take place on Friday after@@ no@@ on , stre@@ am@@ ing at 1 p@@ .@@ m@@ . Eastern time ; the men 's on Saturday , also at 1 .
N@@ BC will air the finals as part of an after@@ no@@ on block beginning at 2 p@@ .@@ m@@ . on both days .
in the mid@@ st of Olympic man@@ ia , they promise a qu@@ iet , lov@@ ely moment , one likely to be over@@ lo@@ oked in the general me@@ le@@ e .
and if con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness raising is to be achieved only by offering up mal@@ e athletes for og@@ ling and objec@@ ti@@ fication - as the United States men 's gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ts recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr@@ . Do@@ o@@ ley only a@@ wa@@ its his gas@@ ping new f@@ an base .
" a Gener@@ ation I@@ s protest@@ ing " in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , L@@ ong a U@@ . S@@ . Al@@ ly
violent Prote@@ sts in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia
demonstr@@ ators demanding political change in E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia have been met with violent res@@ istance by the government .
witnesses say that scores of protesters have been f@@ at@@ ally shot during clashes with police .
is E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia about to cr@@ ack ?
for the last decade , it has been one Africa 's most stable nations , a solid Western ally with a fast @ - @ growing economy .
but in recent months , anti @ - @ government protests have conv@@ ul@@ sed the country , sp@@ reading into more and more areas .
in the last week alone , thousands of people stor@@ med into the streets , demanding fundamental political change .
the government response , according to human rights groups , was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
vide@@ os circ@@ ula@@ ting from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers wh@@ ip@@ ping young people with sti@@ cks as they were forced to perform hand@@ stands against a w@@ all .
the top United N@@ ations human rights official is now calling for a thor@@ ough investigation .
" it was always difficult holding this country together , and moving forward , it will be even har@@ der , " said Ras@@ hi@@ d Ab@@ di , the H@@ or@@ n of Africa project director for the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia is the second most pop@@ ul@@ ous nation in Africa , after Ni@@ ger@@ ia , and its stability is ch@@ er@@ ished by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in Som@@ al@@ ia , and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid .
E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia 's economy has been expan@@ ding at an impres@@ sive cli@@ p .
its infrastructure has improved dr@@ as@@ tically - there is even a new com@@ mu@@ ter train in the capital , Ad@@ dis Ab@@ ab@@ a .
and its streets are ty@@ pic@@ ally qu@@ iet , safe and clean .
though E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia has har@@ dly been a par@@ ag@@ on of democracy - human rights groups have constan@@ tly cited the government 's re@@ pres@@ si@@ veness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dis@@ si@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced .
many have been ex@@ iled , j@@ ail@@ ed , killed or dri@@ ven to the far reac@@ hes of the de@@ sert .
but that may be changing .
" if you su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ate people and they don ' t have any other options but to protest , it break@@ s out , " said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a university lectu@@ rer in central E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
the whole youth is protest@@ ing .
a generation is protest@@ ing .
the complaints are many , covering everything from land use to the governing coalition 's st@@ ran@@ g@@ le@@ hold on power .
after a widely cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed election last year , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 per@@ cent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle along that j@@ ag@@ ged , dispu@@ ted line claimed hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ st groups that had been more or less van@@ qu@@ ished in recent years , like the O@@ ro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Fr@@ on@@ t or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liber@@ ation Fr@@ on@@ t , may try to explo@@ it the tur@@ bul@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ m .
several factors expla@@ in why bit@@ ter feel@@ ings , after years of sim@@ mer@@ ing ben@@ e@@ ath the sur@@ face , are explo@@ ding now .
the first is seem@@ ingly in@@ no@@ cu@@ ous : sm@@ art@@ ph@@ ones .
only in the last couple of years have large numbers of E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ians been able to communic@@ ate using social media as che@@ aper sm@@ art@@ ph@@ ones became common and internet service improved .
even when the government sh@@ u@@ ts down access to Facebook and T@@ wit@@ ter , as it frequ@@ ently does , especially during protests , many people are still able to communic@@ ate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that mas@@ k where they are .
several young E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ians said this was how they gathered for protests .
second , there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ m@@ os and Am@@ har@@ as , E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia 's two largest ethnic groups .
O@@ ro@@ m@@ os and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural allies .
for e@@ ons , Am@@ har@@ as from E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia 's pre@@ dom@@ inan@@ tly Christian high@@ lands flo@@ ur@@ ished in politics and business , explo@@ iting the O@@ ro@@ m@@ os , many of whom are Muslim and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is changing as well .
" we are on the way to co@@ ordin@@ ate under one um@@ bre@@ l@@ la , " said M@@ ula@@ tu Ge@@ me@@ ch@@ u , an O@@ ro@@ mo leader .
the biggest protests have been in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mo areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ m@@ os feel E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia is un@@ fair@@ ly dominated by members of the Ti@@ gr@@ ayan ethnic group , which makes up about 6 per@@ cent of the population and domin@@ ates the military , the intelligence services , commer@@ ce and politics .
the third reason behind the unrest is the loss of M@@ ele@@ s Z@@ en@@ aw@@ i .
Mr@@ . M@@ ele@@ s , a former re@@ bel leader , was E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia 's prime minister for 17 years , until his death from an un@@ dis@@ closed ill@@ ness in 2012 .
he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ i@@ us , a man who could see around cor@@ ners .
analysts say he was especially ade@@ pt at de@@ tec@@ ting early sign@@ als of dis@@ content and using em@@ is@@ sar@@ ies to mas@@ sage and def@@ an@@ g opponents .
" the current regime la@@ cks that ground sav@@ v@@ y , " Mr@@ . Ab@@ di , the conflict analyst , said .
E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia 's new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was p@@ luc@@ ked from rela@@ tive ob@@ sc@@ urity to f@@ ill Mr@@ . M@@ ele@@ s 's sho@@ es .
un@@ like Mr@@ . M@@ ele@@ s , who came from the Ti@@ gra@@ y region of northern E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia , Mr@@ . H@@ ail@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ am is a sou@@ ther@@ ner .
analysts say he does not have the trust of the Ti@@ gr@@ ayan @ - @ controlled security services .
the result , many fear , is more blo@@ od@@ sh@@ ed .
the last time E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia experienced such tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands protes@@ ted over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bun@@ g@@ led and then st@@ ole .
in the en@@ su@@ ing cr@@ ack@@ down , many protesters were killed , though fe@@ wer than in recent months , and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
development experts have praised E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia 's leaders for visi@@ on@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new com@@ mu@@ ter train , and meas@@ ur@@ able stri@@ des in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not stopped the internal res@@ ent@@ ment of E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia 's government from intensi@@ f@@ ying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic shap@@ e .
last month , protesters in G@@ on@@ dar , an Am@@ har@@ a town , attacked businesses owned by Ti@@ gr@@ ay@@ ans , and anti @ - @ Ti@@ gr@@ ayan hat@@ red is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an aw@@ k@@ ward position .
the American government has used E@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ia as a base for dr@@ one flights over neigh@@ bor@@ ing Som@@ al@@ ia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already v@@ ola@@ tile region to cr@@ um@@ ble .
" that , " Mr@@ . Ab@@ di said , " is a very ti@@ ght ro@@ pe to wal@@ k . "
Donald Tr@@ um@@ p Ex@@ pla@@ ins H@@ is Obama @ - @ founded @ - @ Is@@ is claim as " Sar@@ cas@@ m "
Donald J@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p tried to qu@@ ash the latest controversy eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the " foun@@ ders " of the Islamic State terrorist group .
the clar@@ ification raised new questions about the Repub@@ lican presidential nomin@@ e@@ e 's ability to communic@@ ate clearly to the American public .
it also put his sur@@ ro@@ g@@ ates , who have stra@@ ined to defend him during a t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous st@@ ret@@ ch , in the aw@@ k@@ ward position of having to expla@@ in remarks that he might not mean .
after making the sugges@@ tion at a rally on Wednesday night , Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p doub@@ led down on the as@@ ser@@ tion on Thursday , insisting in inter@@ views that he really did inten@@ d to say that the president and Mr@@ s@@ . Clinton had created Is@@ is .
but in an early @ - @ morning T@@ wit@@ ter post on Friday , Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p said that he was just being sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the post was a re@@ vers@@ al from just a day ago , when Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p said in a number of inter@@ views that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the conservative radio host H@@ ug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t tried to help Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p sof@@ ten the re@@ mark by remin@@ ding him that Mr@@ . Obama wants to destro@@ y Is@@ is , the Repub@@ lican presidential nomin@@ e@@ e would not have it .
the latest fi@@ restor@@ m comes as Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p has been trying to re@@ focus his campaign on the economy amid dec@@ lining poll numbers .
Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p and Mr@@ s@@ . Clinton gave du@@ el@@ ing economic spe@@ ech@@ es in Mic@@ hi@@ gan this week .
on Friday , Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to T@@ wit@@ ter , he warned that Mr@@ s@@ . Clinton 's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech bor@@ ing .
Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p has used the sar@@ cas@@ m def@@ en@@ se before .
in late July , after he drew widespread criticism by appe@@ aring to suggest that the Russi@@ ans should h@@ ack Mr@@ s@@ . Clinton 's e@@ ma@@ ils , he later explained his remarks by saying , " O@@ f course I 'm being sar@@ cas@@ tic . "
the approach allows Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p to push the limits of political speech and di@@ al it back as needed .
" I think it 's a pat@@ tern of him test@@ ing certain messages that res@@ on@@ ate with his fans , seeing how they play , and then " clar@@ if@@ ying " one way or another depen@@ ding on the reaction , " said R@@ ut@@ h S@@ her@@ man , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates .
but I also think he 's cle@@ ver about his statements and kno@@ ws they are v@@ ague enough to be fil@@ tered through various len@@ ses .
instead of ton@@ ing things down for a general election audience , Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p has taken an even more ca@@ us@@ tic t@@ one in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to t@@ um@@ ble .
a new N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist poll released on Friday showed Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p tra@@ iling Mr@@ s@@ . Clinton by large mar@@ gin@@ s in North Car@@ ol@@ ina , Vir@@ gin@@ ia and Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o and loc@@ ked in a ti@@ ght race in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
while Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p generally tries to avoid ap@@ olo@@ giz@@ ing for pro@@ vo@@ c@@ ative things that he says , he often accus@@ es his critics of mis@@ constru@@ ing his words or mis@@ understanding his sense of hum@@ or .
but as he faces he@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed s@@ cru@@ tin@@ y during the final months of the presidential campaign , Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p 's j@@ ok@@ es have put his lo@@ yal allies in the un@@ com@@ for@@ table position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how pro@@ vo@@ c@@ ative his remarks .
Ru@@ dol@@ p@@ h W. Gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani , the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p 's most prominent sur@@ ro@@ g@@ ates , went to great len@@ g@@ ths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday .
" I think what he 's saying there is legitimate , political commen@@ tary , " Mr@@ . Gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani said when questi@@ oned about the ver@@ ac@@ ity of Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p 's as@@ ser@@ tion about Mr@@ . Obama and Mr@@ s@@ . Clinton having founded the Islamic State .
it is true in a sense that before Obama , Is@@ is was an almost un@@ known , small little organiz@@ ation , he who called it the j@@ ay@@ ve@@ e , tot@@ ally wrong , and here 's why it happened , because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most main@@ stre@@ am Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mr@@ s@@ . Clinton served as secretary of state , allowed Is@@ is to fes@@ ter by failing to ag@@ gres@@ sively manage the situation in the Middle East .
ahead of ral@@ lies in Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia on Friday , Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p continued to las@@ h out on T@@ wit@@ ter at the news media for har@@ ping on his every word and for being bi@@ ased against him .
he mo@@ cked the " poor , pa@@ the@@ tic " television pun@@ di@@ ts who try to figure him out and said , " T@@ hey can ' t ! "
some Democrats sco@@ ff@@ ed at Mr@@ . Tr@@ um@@ p 's exc@@ use as more evidence that he is un@@ f@@ it to be president .
once pri@@ ced O@@ ut , a C@@ af@@ e R@@ et@@ ur@@ ns in Gre@@ en@@ point
Ver@@ b C@@ af@@ e was a sha@@ b@@ by , cash @ - @ only space in Wil@@ liam@@ s@@ burg that had no W@@ i @ - @ F@@ i but served good co@@ ffe@@ e for 15 years .
n@@ atur@@ ally , it got pri@@ ced out of its B@@ ed@@ for@@ d Av@@ en@@ ue sto@@ ref@@ ront .
the st@@ ore that replaced the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , so@@ ap C@@ her@@ ie , sel@@ ls so@@ aps in the shap@@ e of c@@ up@@ cak@@ es .
loc@@ als b@@ em@@ o@@ an@@ ed it as the latest loss in a gen@@ tri@@ f@@ ying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly C@@ rab@@ app@@ le wrote on T@@ wit@@ ter , " New York is change , I know , but still , can ' t believe C@@ B@@ G@@ B 's is dead and the C@@ hel@@ sea Ho@@ tel is g@@ ut@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a so@@ ap shop . "
but if New York is change , it is also re@@ in@@ vention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b C@@ af@@ e opened last November in Gre@@ en@@ point , less than a m@@ ile north of the original location .
the new Ver@@ b has W@@ i @ - @ F@@ i and accep@@ ts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar un@@ pre@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous vi@@ be .
the co@@ ffe@@ e is still good , too .
leading the new Ver@@ b is C@@ is@@ co R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez , a l@@ ong@@ time employe@@ e at the old caf@@ e who is an owner and the general manager at the new place .
he started at Ver@@ b in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a cust@@ o@@ mer offered to ban@@ kr@@ ol@@ l him in a new out@@ post , he said he was ex@@ cited to do it .
Mr@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
Ver@@ b uses the same distri@@ but@@ or for the b@@ ag@@ els and bought the same model of es@@ pres@@ so mach@@ ine .
it even re@@ used the lights from the old Ver@@ b .
but Mr@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he also wanted to exper@@ im@@ ent .
he introduced new ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents .
B@@ ac@@ on @ - @ eg@@ g @ - @ and @ - @ che@@ ese sand@@ w@@ ic@@ hes are on the men@@ u , and top@@ p@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sa@@ ut@@ é@@ ed on@@ ions are available .
there are bro@@ wn @ - @ ri@@ ce bo@@ w@@ ls .
the caf@@ e no longer serves be@@ er but now makes fresh ju@@ ices .
nine months in , Mr@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no@@ tic@@ ed a stead@@ y stre@@ am of old reg@@ ul@@ ars .
" a lot of former customers got pri@@ ced out of Wil@@ liam@@ s@@ burg too , " he said .
on a recent Sunday , Re@@ bec@@ ca Oli@@ ve@@ ir@@ a was one such cust@@ o@@ mer .
M@@ s@@ . Oli@@ ve@@ ir@@ a , 34 , used to live in Wil@@ liam@@ s@@ burg and went to Ver@@ b frequ@@ ently .
even after she moved to Gre@@ en@@ point , she would still make the tre@@ k .
after Ver@@ b closed , she said , she gave up dr@@ in@@ king co@@ ffe@@ e for a while .
" I real@@ ized it was the co@@ ffe@@ e and the culture at Ver@@ b that I lik@@ ed , " she said .
now she 's back on co@@ ffe@@ e , although that day , instead of her us@@ ual ic@@ ed co@@ ffe@@ e , she went with a b@@ len@@ ded cha@@ i dr@@ ink , another new addition .
T@@ om Ros@@ en@@ th@@ al , another l@@ ong@@ time cust@@ o@@ mer , went fa@@ ith@@ fully to Ver@@ b starting in 2003 .
he '@@ d go before work and order the same thing without fail .
" quarter past seven , every day , like c@@ loc@@ k@@ work , I '@@ d come in and they were making my everything ba@@ gel with but@@ ter , " he said .
photo Mr@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to exper@@ im@@ ent and introduced new ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents to the men@@ u .
these days , Mr@@ . Ros@@ en@@ th@@ al still gets his regular order , but sometimes he 'll s@@ wit@@ ch things up with the bac@@ on , eg@@ g and che@@ ese on an everything ba@@ gel .
Mr@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no hard feel@@ ings about the so@@ ap shop taking over the old space .
in fact , the so@@ ap C@@ her@@ ie owners offered to make special so@@ ap for Ver@@ b , using the caf@@ e 's c@@ old @ - @ bre@@ wed co@@ ffe@@ e as an ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent .
" I think we still might take them up on it , " Mr@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said .
and Gre@@ en@@ point 's traditional Polish residents have em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed the caf@@ e as well .
one of these new customers trans@@ lated the men@@ u into Polish , and Mr@@ . R@@ od@@ ri@@ gu@@ ez said he planned to find a sp@@ ot to display it soon to make his new neigh@@ b@@ ors feel welcome .
the new location has other per@@ ks .
a local ju@@ ice sp@@ ot wants to bot@@ tle and sell the c@@ old @ - @ bre@@ wed co@@ ffe@@ e .
there is a chance the caf@@ e will expand into an adj@@ ac@@ ent building .
for many customers , a new Ver@@ b to get their old fav@@ ori@@ tes is enough .
Jos@@ ep@@ h W@@ hit@@ t was a regular and said he was he@@ art@@ bro@@ ken when they closed .
when the new space opened , Mr@@ . W@@ hit@@ t said , w@@ alk@@ ing in and getting a co@@ ffe@@ e felt like a home@@ coming .
" I 've needed to s@@ me@@ ll that , " he said .
the de@@ pres@@ sing Fo@@ od of the De@@ pres@@ sion , in " A S@@ qu@@ are me@@ al "
in March 19@@ 33 , shortly after as@@ cen@@ ding to the presidency , Fran@@ k@@ lin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t sat down to l@@ un@@ ch in the O@@ val Office .
a G@@ our@@ m@@ and , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t had a tas@@ te for fan@@ cy F@@ if@@ th Av@@ en@@ ue fo@@ ods like p@@ â@@ t@@ é de fo@@ ie gra@@ s and Mar@@ y@@ land ter@@ rap@@ in sou@@ p .
his men@@ u that day was more hum@@ ble : dev@@ iled eg@@ gs in to@@ ma@@ to sa@@ u@@ ce , mas@@ hed pot@@ at@@ o@@ es and , for des@@ sert , pr@@ un@@ e pu@@ d@@ ding .
" it was an act of cul@@ in@@ ary solidarity with the people who were suffer@@ ing , " Jan@@ e Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man said .
her hus@@ band , An@@ drew CoE , added , " I@@ t was also a message to Americ@@ ans about how to e@@ at . "
the couple , who live in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n He@@ ights , are food histor@@ ians .
Mr@@ . CoE 's last book , " cho@@ p Su@@ ey , " was about Chinese cu@@ isine in America , while M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man told the story of life in a L@@ ow@@ er East Si@@ de ten@@ ement through food in her book " 97 or@@ char@@ d . "
their new , collabor@@ ative work , " A S@@ qu@@ are me@@ al , " which will be published Tuesday by Har@@ per , is a history of American food in the Great De@@ pres@@ sion .
showing some cul@@ in@@ ary solidarity of their own , they met a repor@@ ter for din@@ ner at E@@ is@@ en@@ berg 's sand@@ w@@ ich S@@ hop , a tin@@ y no @ - @ f@@ ril@@ ls l@@ un@@ ch counter in the F@@ la@@ tir@@ on district that has been in business since the year of the cr@@ ash , 19@@ 29 .
M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cre@@ am che@@ ese and ch@@ op@@ ped ol@@ ive sand@@ w@@ ich , while Mr@@ . CoE , 57 , had the tur@@ key , mas@@ hed pot@@ at@@ o@@ es and ve@@ get@@ able med@@ ley .
when a repor@@ ter ordered me@@ at@@ lo@@ af , the couple dee@@ med it f@@ it@@ ting for a discussion of De@@ pres@@ sion @ - @ era e@@ ating .
" lo@@ aves were very popular , " M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut lo@@ af , li@@ ver lo@@ af , be@@ an lo@@ af .
they were made from an ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent and a che@@ ap thing that st@@ ret@@ ches the ing@@ re@@ di@@ ent out .
ima@@ g@@ ine e@@ ating enough pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts to serve as your din@@ ner .
Mr@@ . CoE gri@@ ma@@ ced .
" it must have sat in your sto@@ ma@@ ch like lead , " he said .
in the years before the De@@ pres@@ sion , the American table , especially in rural areas , was an all @ - @ you @ - @ can @ - @ e@@ at bu@@ ff@@ et .
teams of women co@@ oked for mal@@ e far@@ m@@ workers , and fresh @ - @ bak@@ ed p@@ ie was served at break@@ fast , l@@ un@@ ch and din@@ ner .
it was Americ@@ ans who had sent food to star@@ ving Europe@@ ans during World War I@@ . " A S@@ qu@@ are me@@ al " ch@@ ron@@ ic@@ les the ways the nation cop@@ ed with su@@ d@@ den@@ ly not being the land of p@@ len@@ ty .
" this was a time when food became a central , fra@@ ught subject for the American people , " Mr@@ . CoE said , expla@@ ining why he and his wife wanted to wr@@ ite about it .
equ@@ ally fra@@ ught was the new budget di@@ et : my@@ ster@@ y dis@@ hes like lo@@ aves and cas@@ ser@@ o@@ les became st@@ ap@@ les , the cas@@ ser@@ ole a " won@@ der@@ ful way to re@@ purpose lef@@ t@@ overs , " M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man noted , because co@@ oks could hi@@ de un@@ appe@@ ti@@ z@@ ing ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents under a cre@@ am@@ y co@@ ating of sa@@ u@@ ce .
fresh fru@@ it was replaced with che@@ aper dri@@ ed fru@@ it .
me@@ at , for years the cen@@ ter of the American me@@ al , became a spar@@ ingly ap@@ por@@ tioned lu@@ x@@ ury .
st@@ range mas@@ h@@ ups were tried as cal@@ oric and n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional fulfil@@ l@@ ment took preced@@ ent over tas@@ te or even common kit@@ ch@@ en sense .
in resear@@ ching the book , which includes re@@ cip@@ es , M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man prepared a period dish of bak@@ ed on@@ ion stu@@ ff@@ ed with pe@@ an@@ ut but@@ ter .
" it was not a popular addition to the din@@ ner table , " Mr@@ . CoE said .
M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man amp@@ li@@ fied : " it was sur@@ real . "
Pe@@ an@@ ut but@@ ter has nothing to say to a bak@@ ed on@@ ion .
it was character@@ istic of a lot of the home @ - @ EC re@@ cip@@ es .
as never before or since , home econom@@ ists - among them L@@ ou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , chief of the federal Bu@@ re@@ au of H@@ ome Econom@@ ics from 19@@ 23 to 19@@ 43 - dro@@ ve the country 's e@@ ating habi@@ ts .
publis@@ hing re@@ cip@@ es and ar@@ tic@@ les in newspapers and magaz@@ ines , they encouraged women to become " bud@@ ge@@ te@@ ers " and rise to the challenge of trans@@ forming g@@ lo@@ p like cre@@ a@@ med sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ ro@@ ts into tas@@ ty dis@@ hes .
" a S@@ qu@@ are me@@ al " is a fe@@ ast of historical ti@@ d@@ bi@@ ts .
especially sav@@ ory are the accounts of the government 's response to its hun@@ gr@@ y citizen@@ ry , like President Her@@ bert Ho@@ over 's let @ - @ me @ - @ e@@ at @ - @ c@@ ake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ ow@@ a far@@ m@@ house co@@ oking of his ch@@ ild@@ hood , he din@@ ed like the milli@@ on@@ aire s@@ oph@@ isti@@ c@@ ate he had become .
" he lik@@ ed to e@@ at Con@@ tin@@ ental cu@@ isine , like f@@ ish with c@@ uc@@ um@@ ber sa@@ u@@ ce , " Mr@@ . CoE said .
he ate in almost a gold @ - @ pla@@ ted din@@ ing room , we@@ aring a din@@ ner j@@ ac@@ ket .
he was f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ously out of tou@@ ch .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t may have committed the same er@@ ror if his wife , E@@ le@@ an@@ or , had not encouraged him to set an example with his sto@@ ma@@ ch .
as the book tells it , Mr@@ s@@ . Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t 's h@@ iring of a hous@@ eke@@ ep@@ er with no interest in f@@ lav@@ or resulted in a White House that " put out not only some of the dre@@ ar@@ i@@ est food in Washington but also some of the most dis@@ m@@ ally prepared . "
many of the De@@ pres@@ sion @ - @ era food ways were aband@@ oned as soon as the country got back on its fe@@ et .
the leg@@ acy is in our continued focus on cal@@ ories and n@@ ut@@ ri@@ tion , M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man said , and on the way science has been applied to co@@ oking .
the couple said that in wr@@ iting the book , they gained greater understanding of the e@@ ating habi@@ ts of M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man 's mother - how she co@@ uldn ' t th@@ row food away , for instance .
" she had a real fear of food waste , " Mr@@ . CoE said .
M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man rec@@ alled : " she actually got people si@@ ck . "
there was the cre@@ am @ - @ pu@@ ff incident .
after the pla@@ tes were clear@@ ed at E@@ is@@ en@@ berg 's , she and Mr@@ . CoE pul@@ led out a des@@ sert they had prepared at home : the pr@@ un@@ e des@@ sert that President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t ate for l@@ un@@ ch .
" it 's called pr@@ un@@ e wh@@ ip , " M@@ s@@ . Zi@@ e@@ gel@@ man said , adding that a common tri@@ ck was to give mode@@ st re@@ cip@@ es a sn@@ az@@ z@@ y name .
there was no wh@@ ip@@ ped cre@@ am , just pr@@ un@@ es , a little bit of fl@@ our , su@@ gar , water and Cin@@ nam@@ on .
everyone re@@ luc@@ tan@@ tly di@@ pped a sp@@ o@@ on into the vis@@ c@@ ous bro@@ wn go@@ o .
sur@@ pris@@ ingly , it was@@ n ' t bad .
Mr@@ . CoE went back for secon@@ ds , and thirds .

Clin@@ t@@ ons ear@@ ned $ 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 , paid 3@@ 4.@@ 2 per@@ cent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the Democratic presidential nomin@@ e@@ e and her hus@@ band had $ 10.@@ 75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 per@@ cent .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ t@@ ons made $ 1 million in char@@ itable contributions , mostly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President B@@ ill Clinton brought in nearly $ 5.@@ 3 million in speaking fe@@ es ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publis@@ her Sim@@ on & Sch@@ us@@ ter for her book on her ten@@ ure at the State Department .
Clinton 's running M@@ ate , U@@ . S@@ . Sen@@ ator Ti@@ m Ka@@ ine of Vir@@ gin@@ ia , along with his wife , An@@ ne Hol@@ ton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20@@ .@@ 3 per@@ cent in 2015 .
" Hillary Clinton and Ti@@ m Ka@@ ine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , " Clinton campaign aide J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri said in a statement .
in star@@ k contrast , Donald Tr@@ um@@ p is hiding behind fak@@ e ex@@ cus@@ es and back@@ trac@@ king on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is custom@@ ary for U@@ . S@@ . presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
tr@@ um@@ p , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have cited an au@@ dit by the Inter@@ nal R@@ ev@@ en@@ ue Service as a reason for his ref@@ usal to release his returns .
" your move , " Clinton campaign aide I@@ an Sam@@ s said on T@@ wit@@ ter , lin@@ king to the Democratic nomin@@ e@@ e 's returns .
on Thursday , Tr@@ um@@ p 's special coun@@ sel , Michael Co@@ h@@ en , told CNN he would not allow Tr@@ um@@ p to release them until the audi@@ ts are complete .
tr@@ um@@ p 's critics , including 2012 Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney and other fellow Repub@@ lic@@ ans , have said his ref@@ usal ra@@ ises questions about his net worth , his char@@ itable contributions , his business de@@ al@@ ings and various other ties , including with Russia .
Clinton has p@@ oun@@ ced on the issue , rele@@ asing an online video on Friday highligh@@ ting high @ - @ profile Repub@@ lic@@ ans urging Tr@@ um@@ p to release his taxes .
on Thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in Mic@@ hi@@ gan .
" he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , " she told the crowd .
politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ um@@ p paid zer@@ o to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a New York Times business col@@ um@@ n@@ ist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accoun@@ tan@@ ts saying that could still be the case .
federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire investor W@@ ar@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 per@@ cent .
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal .
at a Clinton rally last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka , Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t , whose Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire H@@ ath@@ away con@@ g@@ l@@ om@@ er@@ ate is based there , challen@@ ged Tr@@ um@@ p to meet and exchange tax returns .
bu@@ ff@@ et said that he too was under I@@ RS au@@ dit and Tr@@ um@@ p is " af@@ raid " not of the tax @ - @ collection agency but of voters .
Clinton 's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ t@@ ons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ a@@ qu@@ a , New York , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 per@@ cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0@@ .5 per@@ cent .
the Clin@@ t@@ ons ' 2015 return showed that , un@@ like most Americ@@ ans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low @ - @ cost index mutual fund , and the Clin@@ t@@ ons reported divi@@ den@@ d and interest income of $ 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

Je@@ wish film@@ maker sla@@ ms Berlin hotel for re@@ moving Israel di@@ al code after Arab " request " - R@@ T News
a French film@@ maker of Je@@ wish origin un@@ le@@ as@@ hed a media fur@@ or after he revealed that the K@@ emp@@ inski Br@@ ist@@ ol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel 's di@@ al code , with employe@@ e citing " requests " from Ara@@ bic customers .
C@@ lau@@ de L@@ an@@ z@@ mann , an author of H@@ olo@@ ca@@ ust docum@@ entary " S@@ ho@@ ah , " ven@@ ted his fru@@ stration at the K@@ emp@@ inski Br@@ ist@@ ol Ho@@ tel in Berlin , wr@@ iting an open letter in the German out@@ let F@@ A@@ Z .
during his recent stay , L@@ an@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel in the list of di@@ al co@@ des provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 20@@ 16 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was elimin@@ ated and er@@ adi@@ cated ?
L@@ an@@ z@@ mann wrote .
instead , K@@ emp@@ inski Br@@ ist@@ ol offers an opportunity to di@@ al Israel via an own call cen@@ ter .
seeking ex@@ plan@@ ation , the film@@ maker addressed the issue at the hotel 's rec@@ ep@@ tion .
the answer he got there , L@@ an@@ z@@ mann wrote " sho@@ cked him . "
the hotel 's c@@ ler@@ k said that the measure was " a de@@ liber@@ ate decision by the management of K@@ emp@@ inski @ - @ Ho@@ tels . "
the reason behind the move triggered even more ou@@ tra@@ ge by the film@@ maker .
" the majority of our guests are Ara@@ bs and they demanded Israel 's code to be de@@ le@@ ted , " the employe@@ e was quoted as saying by L@@ an@@ z@@ mann .
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yak@@ ov H@@ ada@@ s @ - @ H@@ an@@ del@@ sman called the case a " great sha@@ me , " Su@@ d@@ de@@ utsche Ze@@ it@@ un@@ g reports .
we were app@@ alled and sho@@ cked by the incident .
it is in itself a great sha@@ me .
the fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater dis@@ gr@@ ace .
that needs no ex@@ plan@@ ation .
we expect that the hotel dra@@ ws the right conclu@@ sions , " the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the K@@ emp@@ inski hotel simply " c@@ av@@ ed in " to the alleged demands of Ara@@ bic customers .
" sha@@ me on you , " another post stated , poin@@ ting out that the hotel , located in the no@@ ble Kur@@ fur@@ st@@ en@@ dam@@ m street stands near a syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gue .
the hotel itself was quick to br@@ ush off any accusations , calling what happened an " over@@ sight " and " ap@@ olo@@ giz@@ ing " to L@@ an@@ z@@ mann , D@@ er Sp@@ i@@ e@@ gel reports .
" there was never a direct order " not to include Israel in the fast di@@ al list , " Su@@ d@@ de@@ utsche Ze@@ it@@ un@@ g quoted a K@@ emp@@ inski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .

students clas@@ hed with police in the Bra@@ zil@@ ian city of Sa@@ o Pa@@ ul@@ o on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used te@@ ar gas and ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ lets against the protesters .
the troub@@ le started when law enforcement officers tried to dis@@ per@@ se the students , which led to the police using ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ lets and te@@ ar gas .
several hun@@ d@@ red students took part in the demonstr@@ ation to express their dis@@ may at the plans .
under proposals from the govern@@ or of the state of Sa@@ o Pa@@ ul@@ o Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 30@@ 0,000 students will be re@@ located in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen wr@@ iting gra@@ ff@@ iti on the wal@@ ls against the interim President Mic@@ h@@ el Te@@ mer .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en mas@@ se to support suspended President D@@ il@@ ma Ro@@ us@@ se@@ ff as the country 's sen@@ ate voted for her im@@ peac@@ hment .
trade between Russia & Iran sur@@ ges 71 % - R@@ T Business
with the lif@@ ting of sanctions , trade turn@@ over between Moscow and T@@ eh@@ ran has gro@@ wn 7@@ 0.@@ 9 per@@ cent in year @ - @ on @ - @ year terms , according to Russia 's ambassador to Iran , L@@ ev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan .
since international sanctions against Iran were lif@@ ted , there has been a sur@@ ge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are res@@ um@@ ing existing ties with Iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral co@@ operation with Iran , " D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan said .
he noted that in the first five months of 20@@ 16 the trade turn@@ over between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 per@@ cent compared to the same period of 2015 and amoun@@ ted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian exports to Iran jum@@ ped by 9@@ 1.5 per@@ cent and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per@@ cent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
the boost in trade was achieved by supplies of mach@@ in@@ ery , ground vehicles and weapons , " the ambassador said .
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is also expec@@ ting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year .
last year , the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 3@@ 5,000 visas , mostly travel , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia .
it 's safe to say that last year 's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be bro@@ ken , " he said .
at the same time , relatively few Russi@@ ans are visiting Iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
" I can person@@ ally recommen@@ d to visit the cities of Is@@ fa@@ han , S@@ hi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d that have preser@@ ved monuments of ancient Per@@ si@@ an civil@@ iz@@ ation in good condition , " he said .
cash from İz@@ mir to FE@@ T@@ O - Economic News
some interes@@ ting details have started to come to light regarding the Chairman of the Executive Board of the K@@ av@@ uk@@ lar Group , Abdullah K@@ av@@ uk and the Chairman of the Executive Board of the K@@ üç@@ ük@@ b@@ ay Group , Ahmet K@@ üç@@ ük@@ b@@ ay , who were detained because they provided financial support to FE@@ T@@ O .
it was determined that K@@ üç@@ ük@@ b@@ ay and K@@ av@@ uk , who are the number 1 and 2 financial sources of FE@@ T@@ O in İz@@ mir , sent money regular@@ ly in huge amounts to FE@@ T@@ O / P@@ D@@ Y terrorist organiz@@ ation r@@ ing@@ leader F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gu@@ len by cour@@ ier every month .
it was as@@ cer@@ tained that the money sent to Gu@@ len was not transferred via banks but sent via an organiz@@ ation member cour@@ ier so that it was@@ n ' t put on record .
on the other hand , among the people detained and brought to court in A@@ mas@@ ya within the sc@@ ope of the investigation regarding the FE@@ T@@ O coup attempt , 9 of them , including Mer@@ z@@ if@@ on Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman , Fatih Alt@@ ın@@ ay , were arrested and 7 of them were released on the condition of judicial control .
30 thous@@ and li@@ ras po@@ c@@ ke@@ ted over a 10 year term
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan 's " reduce the interest rate " appeal sets the banks in motion .
it was suggested that banks participate in the campaign stage which Em@@ lak Kon@@ ut started and which G@@ Y@@ O@@ DE@@ R then participated in .
a sugges@@ tion was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to drop housing loan interest rates to under 1 per@@ cent as they are considered a psych@@ ological limit .
13 banks dropped housing loan interest rates to under 1 per@@ cent .
it was the public banks that launched the dis@@ count r@@ ush .
when the previous monthly interest rates , changing between 1.@@ 12 and 1.@@ 29 , are used as a base , consumers who used a 10 year term housing loan will pay less interest of between 15 and 30 billion T@@ L with the latest adj@@ ust@@ ment .
5 O@@ R 10 year option
so , how much of an advantage will the interest rate reduction provide to those who buy a house ?
a person who has a 100 thous@@ and L@@ ir@@ a , 10 year loan term , will benefit to the tun@@ e of 30 thous@@ and L@@ ir@@ a from the drop in interest .
a large majority of housing loan users choose a 5 @ - @ 10 year term payment sch@@ ed@@ ule .
interest rates are expected to drop more in the coming days .
the interest rate reduction will positi@@ vely affect sales .
house sales in 2015 were 1 million 2@@ 8@@ 9 thous@@ and , increasing by 10.@@ 6 per@@ cent with respect to the previous year .
sales are expected to exce@@ ed 1.5 million with the cuts in interest rates .
G@@ Y@@ O@@ DE@@ R President Az@@ iz Tor@@ un : it should be reduced to less than 9 per@@ cent a year
it is an important step for public banks to cut interest rates .
they paid close attention to the appeal by our President and reduced interest rates .
however , this rate should fall to under 9 per@@ cent a year .
if this c@@ utting process continues , we are thin@@ king of exten@@ ding the 0.@@ 70 monthly interest campaign that we started for several more months .
Kuz@@ u Group M@@ ember of the Board Öz@@ en Kuz@@ u : our campaign may be extended by 3 months
participation also by the banks in our attempt to bring dynam@@ ism to the economy may bring about the prol@@ ong@@ ation of this historic campaign for at least another 3 to 4 months .
however , loan interest rates should fall below 9 per@@ cent on a ye@@ arly basis .
it is ple@@ asing to see that every sector is making a sac@@ rif@@ ice in the purchase of housing by citizens with a positive mental state just in the housing sector and real market which has not been seen in the course of history .
P@@ ola@@ t Holding Chairman of the Board Adnan P@@ ola@@ t : we expect full support from the banks
it is a n@@ ice move for them to call for an interest rate reduction after the appeal made to the banks from our President .
apart from that , there are a certain number of steps taken towards the revi@@ val of the economy in all sectors .
the campaigns the NGOs make , the decision the Central Bank takes and all the steps taken in this direction are for the country ...
all banks should assume responsibility .
we say to them , come , join this Mo@@ bil@@ iz@@ ation , wal@@ k the same path with us and let 's revi@@ ve the economy together , hand in hand .

interest rates fall , houses increase in price
a friend of mine who is the manager in a public bank sent me a message .
always the same thing happen@@ s .
interest rates drop , house prices increase .
interest rates increase , house prices drop .
he says , " H@@ ere it still happen@@ s like this . "
he says that he received this information because his job is related to personal loans .
he says that the contr@@ actors who entered the Em@@ lak Kon@@ ut campaign with a 0.@@ 70 interest rate have increased prices in many housing projects .
I chec@@ ked to see if there were any truth to this .
the situation kind of has more min@@ uses than pl@@ uses ...
at the time , I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed our talk with a contr@@ actor who participated in the construction summit our newspaper organiz@@ ed one week after the F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist Organ@@ iz@@ ation 's coup attempt on July 15 .
the bos@@ s of a large company ...
when I heard from the contr@@ actor , whose name I won ' t give , he said , " I@@ n fact a 10 per@@ cent increase in prices should be made , " and I said , " W@@ ill you do an opportun@@ istic coup ? "
after the coup attempt , contr@@ actors started a big sales campaign with 0.@@ 70 interest and 120 month @ - @ terms with the campaign under the leadership of Em@@ lak Kon@@ ut .
I agree that they assu@@ med responsibility and under@@ took a risk before the banks .
however , we are now acting in unity and solidarity to not slow down Turkey 's pace .
the 1 @ - @ month campaign supported banks by reducing interest rates .
then , no one should increase profits .
warn those who do it among yo@@ ur@@ selves .

banking Re@@ gula@@ tion and Su@@ per@@ vision Agency ( B@@ D@@ DK ) He@@ ad , Mehmet Ali Ak@@ ben , made a statement about President Erdoğan 's " loan rec@@ all " warning to banks .
Ak@@ ben said , " I@@ f the banks do a loan rec@@ all with ul@@ ter@@ ior mo@@ tives by using it as an opportunity because of market conditions , we will not allow it . "
we say to those who bring these kin@@ ds of complaints and this information to us , ' Mak@@ e an application to the B@@ D@@ DK compla@@ int line by giving the names on the basis of bank and company . '
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned the banks with these words in the statement he made y@@ es@@ ter@@ day : " I say that when the interest rates drop and loan opportunities are wi@@ den@@ ed , a new period will open up for our country , our investors , and the banks . "
I also want to declare , ref@@ rain from giving loans in this period of our state , the banks that rec@@ all loans with fic@@ ti@@ ti@@ ous ex@@ cus@@ es are under@@ stood to have chosen a side .
when interest rates were 7 @ - @ 8 % per ann@@ um , banks ear@@ ned money from these trans@@ actions .
more than 500 thous@@ and Russian tourists are expected
at the EX@@ P@@ O 20@@ 16 meeting organiz@@ ed in the An@@ tal@@ ya exhibition area , Profes@@ sional Ho@@ tel Man@@ agers Association ( P@@ O@@ Y@@ D ) He@@ ad , Ali Kız@@ ıl@@ da@@ ğ , stated that Turkish @ - @ Russian relations were on the right path before the July 15 coup attempt , scheduled flights started from Russia to An@@ tal@@ ya and a certain level of revi@@ val has been experienced in tourism .
stat@@ ing that the meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President of Russia , Vladimir Putin , ex@@ cited the tourism sector as well as tra@@ ding sectors between the two countries . Kız@@ ıl@@ da@@ ğ said , " I expect that there will be many positive developments with regard to both tourism and all sectors from agriculture to food , and from construction to tex@@ tile . "
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries and we have traditional relation@@ ships going back many years .
he said , " O@@ n the path that the two countries ' leaders have opened , I think we , as the sectors , will close the gap immediately and reach our goals if we make progress rap@@ id@@ ly . "
men@@ tioning that if the coup attempt had not occurred the number of Russian tourists to Turkey would have exce@@ eded 1 million , Kız@@ ıl@@ da@@ ğ continued as follows :
we lost one month in the period that we call high season so targets have been down@@ siz@@ ed .
even so , I think we will sur@@ pass the number of 500 thous@@ and if char@@ ter flights start .
moreover , it may be possible that the season exten@@ ds to the end of October , or even to the middle of November .
in such a case , additional flights may be added at the beginning of the year .
I suggest that this positive atmosphere will be well appreci@@ ated by Russian people .
they also have a l@@ on@@ ging for Turkey .
with this momentum , I think we can do our best to hop@@ efully reach 700 thous@@ and .
stat@@ ing that they feel hop@@ eful for 20@@ 17 with regard to the Russian market , Kız@@ ıl@@ da@@ ğ said that if the Russian economy ga@@ thers streng@@ th along with relations between the two countries , the number of Russian tourists may reach over 3 million again next year .
stat@@ ing that domestic reser@@ v@@ ations started , little by little , with the lif@@ ting of the ban on public ser@@ van@@ ts travel@@ ing , P@@ O@@ Y@@ D He@@ ad Kız@@ ıl@@ da@@ ğ said , " Th@@ ere has been a turn@@ around in cancel@@ led reser@@ v@@ ations and new reser@@ v@@ ations have also started to be taken . "
he said , " We have hop@@ eful expectations for E@@ id al @ - @ Ad@@ ha . "
Kız@@ ıl@@ da@@ ğ expressed that Iran 's lif@@ ting of the ban on travel agencies regarding the sale of tour tic@@ kets after the coup attempt is also a very good development and said , " I@@ t would be very good if we could bring 100 @ - @ 200 thous@@ and people from Iran in 1,@@ 2 @ - @ 2 months . "
should those who have a current loan ren@@ ew it ?
first of all , cons@@ ult with the bank from which you received the loan and learn how the new interest rates will affect your loan .
have your bank cal@@ c@@ ulate the cost of using a new loan with a lower interest rate and early loan closure amount ( generally 1.5 @ - @ 2 per@@ cent of the current amount ) .
if you still have an advantage when you include all the costs , you can make an application for a loan with a low interest rate .
no break for the Li@@ ons !
current champ@@ ions Bes@@ ik@@ tas aim to enter the new season on a high by winning the Su@@ per Cup match they will play against Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay .

the experienced tra@@ in@@ er said , " I fully believe that friend@@ ship will remain at the fo@@ ref@@ ront not only on the p@@ it@@ ch but also in the stands in these days in which we need friend@@ ship and bro@@ ther@@ hood more than the ever . "

H@@ ü@@ sey@@ in Gü@@ lerce : Gü@@ len 's de@@ mis@@ e depends on the collapse of 3 stands
commen@@ ting on the coup attempt by FE@@ T@@ O , H@@ ü@@ sey@@ in Gü@@ lerce made stri@@ king statements .
the head@@ lines from H@@ ü@@ sey@@ in Gü@@ lerce 's statements are as follows :
it occurred to me that they would attempt a coup and I wrote for the last 5 @ - @ 6 months in my ar@@ tic@@ les that " they may attempt to do that but they can not do it within the chain of command . "
I did not know two things ; the first one is that it would be widespread and deep , for example , 8 @ - @ year aide de camp of the Turkish Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie Forces Commander and ai@@ des of the es@@ te@@ e@@ med President .
the es@@ te@@ e@@ med President is the person who strugg@@ led most ; go@@ d kno@@ ws he was car@@ eful when selec@@ ting his ai@@ des but their most important character@@ istic is unprecedented confi@@ denti@@ ality .
they are real hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes .
one of the most important pi@@ ec@@ es of proof of the expression , " T@@ his is not something that a retired pre@@ ac@@ her like FE@@ T@@ O could do " is the fact that it is such a deep con@@ spir@@ acy .
he is certainly receiving support from the C@@ IA .
the C@@ IA started to collabor@@ ate with this person very early .
Mah@@ mu@@ t Ö@@ v@@ ür said in 2014 that Fu@@ at Doğu and F@@ et@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len had a meeting at V@@ eh@@ bi Ko@@ ç 's house in 197@@ 1 .
the people who paid attention to these matters most at that time said that the relations between M@@ İT and the C@@ IA are in a very close period .
the U@@ SA paid the wages of our armed forces , and before we re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed this , a gu@@ y emerged one way or the other .
when we learn this is in 2014 .
after Mah@@ mu@@ t B@@ ey 's article , there were no statements to den@@ y it .
for example , A@@ dil Ö@@ k@@ süz was caught in the base , was he not ?
it is won@@ dered who he is .
the gu@@ y went to Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia 2 times within the last 25 days before the coup attempt , and came back 2 days before .
A@@ dil Ö@@ k@@ süz went abroad 1@@ 09 times since 2002 .
when you gather them together , this should be investigated ; it should be investigated which ones of those who are es@@ cap@@ ees now went to the U@@ SA with an exc@@ use after March 1999 when F@@ et@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len went to the U@@ SA .
it will be seen that they went to Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia for some reason .
however , their major contacts with the C@@ IA can be determined from this ; A@@ mon@@ g the people to be promo@@ ted , especially in the Police Department , there are many who were sent to the U@@ SA .
it is in the W@@ ik@@ il@@ e@@ aks documents ; Gü@@ len has a foundation established and this foundation has mutual meetings with the C@@ IA .
work has been done to show these relation@@ ships with the C@@ IA in official recor@@ ds 15 years before .
I said that Fu@@ at Av@@ ni is an intelligence po@@ ol in Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia 2 years before .
the person who worked in the Prime Minister 's Office works for Fu@@ at Av@@ ni .
however , the bad thing is the following ; this information fell to Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia as well as the C@@ IA .
Gü@@ len 's fall depends on the collapse of three stands ; one of them constitu@@ tes the friend@@ ship circ@@ le that we call gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots ; there are quite deep@@ ly hy@@ p@@ no@@ ti@@ z@@ ed ones among them , they are still saying that this coup attempt is an Erdoğan film .
as I said before , the first one is gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots support .
the ste@@ aling of the questions , the the@@ ft and violation of ri@@ gh@@ t@@ ful shares damaged the gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots support very much .
the other two stands are political support and international support .
international support still exists .
the only thing to break the political support is auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation of the fact that the tap@@ es of Bay@@ kal and M@@ HP man@@ agers were taken by FE@@ T@@ O .
after July 15 , es@@ te@@ e@@ med K@@ ıl@@ ı@@ ç@@ dar@@ oğlu is also using " FE@@ T@@ O " ; everyone has opened their ey@@ es .
Gü@@ len is such a tri@@ ck@@ s@@ ter that he says , " I did not do it , those around me did it . "
when he is next to me , he says , " F@@ or G@@ od 's s@@ ake , H@@ ü@@ sey@@ in B@@ ey , these female dis@@ ci@@ ples are seeing very un@@ us@@ ual dre@@ ams and sending them to me , now I banned it because it is not good to act on your dre@@ ams . "
a voice recor@@ ding appeared ; in this voice recor@@ ding the speaker is Bar@@ bar@@ os Ko@@ cak@@ ur@@ t : H@@ od@@ ja , friends saw a dre@@ am , our Pro@@ p@@ he@@ t said double up the t@@ we@@ ets .
1 police officer became a m@@ art@@ y@@ r in N@@ us@@ ay@@ bin
according to information received , fire commen@@ ced by the terrorists using long bar@@ re@@ led weapons against the ar@@ mo@@ red car in which there were police who were conducting their pat@@ rol duty in the Se@@ la@@ hat@@ tin Ey@@ y@@ ü@@ bi Ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ hood .
one police officer became a m@@ art@@ y@@ r and one officer got wo@@ unded when initial fir@@ ing commen@@ ced .
two terrorists were ne@@ ut@@ ral@@ ized in the clas@@ h after the police responded .
the wo@@ unded officer was brought to N@@ us@@ ay@@ bin State Hos@@ p@@ ital .
operations are continuing in the region .
the coup pl@@ ot@@ ters were stal@@ led , TV broadcas@@ ts were not inter@@ rup@@ ted
playing an important part in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15 , private television stations continued to broadcast thanks to technical personnel in Türk@@ sat that her@@ o@@ ically res@@ isted the coup pl@@ ot@@ ters .
see this her@@ o , As@@ ım Ak@@ kaya ...
stat@@ ing that they entered a mental attitude of res@@ istance after the in@@ struction to cut the broadcast while an announcement was read on T@@ R@@ T , Ak@@ kaya said , " I was prepared to give my right ar@@ m after thin@@ king that my friends became m@@ art@@ y@@ r@@ s in the fir@@ ing started from the helicop@@ ter . "
they held a gun to my head and wanted me to cut the broadcast .
I shut down only local TV .
after that I said that we need to go to the dish an@@ ten@@ n@@ as to make them move away from the building .
I spent around 20 minutes in the section in which there are an@@ ten@@ n@@ as .
he said , " I cut some of the cab@@ les also here but did not inter@@ f@@ ere with the broadcas@@ ts . "
when the coup pl@@ ot@@ ters could not succeed in c@@ utting the broadcast in Türk@@ sat , they brought experts from S@@ aman@@ yolu TV .
these terrorists were arrested by the police who arrived at the crime scene after 3 minutes .
indic@@ ating that the coup pl@@ ot@@ ters under@@ stood that TV broadcas@@ ts were continuing when they came back to the building after a telephone call came to them around 1 hour later and that he had a close br@@ ush with death at that time , Ak@@ kaya talk@@ ed about what he experienced as follows :
that night , I took over guard duty at 8 o ' clock .
that place was entr@@ us@@ ted to us .
my friends were on duty in the e @ - @ State and electri@@ cal system respectively .
when we met at 2@@ 1.@@ 00 to dr@@ ink te@@ a , helicop@@ ters passed over us on low al@@ titu@@ de flights .
there were several aircraft around the helicop@@ ter that made a sil@@ ent and low al@@ titu@@ de f@@ light .
we saw their lights .
pos@@ sibly , they were un@@ man@@ ned a@@ erial vehicles that can take pic@@ tures .
they were fl@@ ying in front of the helicop@@ ters .
I have been there for 11 years , and I called the regular army because I saw such a low f@@ light for the first time .
after that the movement started .
while wat@@ ching the news we lear@@ ned that the bridge was closed .
during that time our general director gave the order for friends that were not on their shift of guard duty to come to the building .
while we were going to the regular army to get information , we lear@@ ned that all the progra@@ ms broadcast by T@@ R@@ T were off @ - @ air .
T@@ R@@ T broadcas@@ ts were cut for 5 minutes .
I called the T@@ R@@ T program control@@ ler but I could not reach anyone .
our control station said that T@@ R@@ T broadcas@@ ts came back on @ - @ air and the announcement started to be read .
our Assistant General Director , Hal@@ il Y@@ eş@@ ilç@@ i@@ men , wanted T@@ R@@ T broadcas@@ ts to be immediately cut upon the in@@ struction of the general director .
as T@@ R@@ T 3 did a wide broadcast from the channel , we started to prepare the works to cut the broadcast .
a short while ago we heard Prime Minister Bin@@ ali Yıl@@ dır@@ ım say , " there is an attempt . "
our director 's " cut T@@ R@@ T " in@@ struction some@@ what brought us to a mental state of res@@ istance .
we cut T@@ R@@ T , and after a while we heard the sound of a helicop@@ ter .
we went out , the helicop@@ ter lan@@ ded and the army started shooting every@@ where , everyone sc@@ at@@ tered some@@ where .
we hi@@ d in a building at the back .
we were 12 people in total .
when we went back , the soldiers dis@@ em@@ b@@ ark@@ ing from the helicop@@ ter entered inside .
soldiers wo@@ unded some of our friends .
we showed up to stand with them .
at that time , I saw that they caught our general director and brought him to his k@@ ne@@ es .
the soldiers talk@@ ed among themselves .
one of them said , ' let 's sho@@ ot one of them , let them be scar@@ ed . '
after that they made all of us sit inside .
their comman@@ ders started to sh@@ out , " Wh@@ o is in charge here , I won ' t ask again . "
especially when we heard such talk as , " let 's sho@@ ot one of them , " we thought like this : we know nothing about our home@@ town but the in@@ struction to ' C@@ ut T@@ R@@ T ' came to us .
that is to say there is a res@@ istance .
at that moment I felt that I gave up on my life .
I said , ' it is me . '
I got to my fe@@ et up at that moment not kno@@ wing what to do .
at that moment , the only thing I thought is the fact that fire had started from the helicop@@ ter towards my friends at the regular army office .
I thought that 10 @ - @ 15 of my friends became m@@ art@@ y@@ r@@ s at the regular army office and I felt a kind of com@@ for@@ t when I thought ' they will k@@ ill us so@@ on@@ er or later . '
the commander at the head of them said , ' Y@@ ou will cut all broadcas@@ ts except T@@ R@@ T . '
there is a system in which we monitor local chan@@ n@@ els when they are going up to the sa@@ tel@@ li@@ te .
we send 80 of 200 local chan@@ n@@ els for broadcast from the room in question .
this room came to my mind .
there were no national broadcas@@ ts among them .
if I cut them and say that all of them are cut , at least support will come or help will reach us from outside .
I said I would do whatever I could do .
after all , we faced up to the fact that we won ' t be able to get out from there .
I said , ' O@@ K , I will cut . '
I cut the an@@ ten@@ na output of one of the local channel pack@@ ages .
I cut the power but@@ ton going to the monit@@ ors in which we can watch the national chan@@ n@@ els .
in this way , it will be written no signal in all the scre@@ ens .
I said that I needed to go to the an@@ ten@@ n@@ as to completely cut them .
the commander sent me to the an@@ ten@@ na with two soldiers .
I opened the an@@ ten@@ na room , one of the soldiers said , " stop there . "
he held the gun to my fore@@ head .
he said , ' Y@@ ou will cut all of them except T@@ R@@ T , there will be none remaining , I will sho@@ ot one of you so@@ on@@ er or later , it will be you . '
as I had already given up on my life , I said without fear , ' Wh@@ en you go , you will see that all of them are fro@@ zen ' , I did not say anything else .
we entered the station and I cut the local broadcas@@ ts .
we passed to the other an@@ ten@@ na .
at that time there was a system that correspon@@ ded to around 20 national chan@@ n@@ els .
when I cut the local chan@@ n@@ els , around 20 monit@@ ors went b@@ lan@@ k .
G@@ od helped us in such a way that both of us had no difficul@@ ty when we ans@@ w@@ ered and it conf@@ used them for a moment .
they believed the ans@@ wers we gave .
they did not per@@ s@@ ist .
we were reli@@ ev@@ ed .
after leaving the an@@ ten@@ na they asked where the trans@@ former was .
I said , ' I don ' t know I am a TV broadcas@@ ter ' , he asked , ' I@@ s there an electri@@ ci@@ an . '
I said , ' Th@@ ere is no electri@@ ci@@ an in the evening after working hours , if there is a mal@@ function a team comes . '
in fact there is an electri@@ ci@@ an at that time .
it occurred to me that I did not cut the Cyprus broadcas@@ ts .
I was thin@@ king about c@@ utting them to st@@ all the soldiers .
they felt reli@@ ev@@ ed because they thought that the broadcas@@ ts were cut .
they did not think of looking at the broadcas@@ ts .
then the group proce@@ eded to wait .
when they turned on the TV in the waiting area after about an hour , they saw A Haber broadcas@@ ting .
the soldi@@ er entered .
he said , ' M@@ y commander , A Haber has not stopped broadcas@@ ting . '
my@@ self and the commander caught each other 's eye .
he said , ' stand up . '
I stood up .
at that moment one soldi@@ er said , ' there are still continuing broadcas@@ ts . '
he said , ' there are chan@@ n@@ els broadcas@@ ting in Cyprus . '
I said , ' they are broadcas@@ ting through Cyprus , we can not do anything to them . '
he said , ' Af@@ ter wr@@ iting to someone , he made us stand up and said wal@@ k . '
the coup pl@@ ot@@ ters es@@ cap@@ ed from Türk@@ sat by min@@ i@@ bus .
I saw from the ph@@ otos that the soldi@@ er who brought me to the to@@ il@@ et and gave me water was killed on the seat of that min@@ i@@ bus .
they fired 3 times to his fore@@ head and shot him in his che@@ eks .
my friends also confirmed that he was the soldi@@ er .
they called that soldi@@ er a ' youn@@ g@@ s@@ ter ' when they were with us .
pos@@ sibly he was a private soldi@@ er that did his military service .
they may have execu@@ ted him to get rid of him .
according to As@@ ım Ak@@ kaya 's expres@@ sions , the first police squ@@ ad came to Türk@@ sat from G@@ öl@@ başı .
when the police lear@@ ned that there are helicop@@ ters around and the security gu@@ ards were shot at , they went to the district to get am@@ mun@@ ition .
they came back after 40 minutes .
when the police squ@@ ad@@ s came they could not see anyone at the Türk@@ sat ou@@ ter security g@@ ate .
saying that the so @ - @ called experts came to the building just 3 @ - @ 4 minutes after the police , Ak@@ kaya said , " T@@ hey said to the police ' they called us from inside , we are Türk@@ sat personnel , we have to enter immediately . ' "
he said , " Wh@@ en the police asked their identity , all four people has@@ ti@@ ly gr@@ as@@ ped their ph@@ ones and informed the inside ' we got caught . ' "

the tra@@ itors who shot the people were protecting PKK
it started to come to light why Turkey , in a bit@@ ter struggle to end PKK terrorism for more than for@@ ty years , could not destro@@ y the organiz@@ ation leaders in this struggle .
having in@@ fil@@ tra@@ ted the critical institutions of Turkey , FE@@ T@@ O milit@@ ants worked to cl@@ ing to Turkey 's w@@ ings from all quarters .
at this point today , serious suspic@@ ions and proof started to emer@@ ge that FE@@ T@@ O is behind critical incidents like the H@@ rant Dink murder , the U@@ lu@@ d@@ ere incident , the dow@@ ning of the Russian aircraft .

in research conducted by the intelligence de@@ part@@ ments , it was determined that Gö@@ k@@ han S@@ ön@@ mez@@ ateş has a len@@ g@@ th@@ y criminal past .
he protected the terrorists

it was claimed that the intelligence information given by MI@@ T regarding the point at the fo@@ ot of Kan@@ dil moun@@ tains , where the squ@@ ad leader of the PKK terrorist organiz@@ ation was located , were dist@@ or@@ ted by Gö@@ k@@ han S@@ ön@@ mez@@ ateş and the targets were preven@@ ted from being hit .
with the change to the co@@ ordin@@ ates , it was determined that the war plan@@ es that fle@@ w to destro@@ y the PKK 's leaders , hit points to the side of the targets , and so the terrorist leaders es@@ cap@@ ed .
it emerged in the intelligence In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition that S@@ ön@@ mez@@ ateş played a key role in both the dist@@ ort@@ ing of the targets and by allowing PKK terrorists to es@@ cape from their places before the F @ - @ 16@@ s took off .

M@@ İT , Police In@@ tel@@ ligence and the State Su@@ per@@ vis@@ ory Council are conducting the investigation together .
within the sc@@ ope of the investigation , research will focus on whether the com@@ mission@@ ed officers , whose case were opened , rose in ran@@ k from non @ - @ military or by fin@@ ishing the military colle@@ ge and the promo@@ tions they ear@@ ned , the places they performed their duties and their comman@@ ders .

we are making an appeal to our people to not send their children to these places .

the sk@@ y will be the scene of me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wers
T@@ Ü@@ B@@ İ@@ T@@ AK National Ob@@ serv@@ atory Resear@@ cher and Istanbul University A@@ str@@ onom@@ y and Sp@@ ace Sciences Department L@@ ec@@ tu@@ rer Dr. Has@@ an E@@ sen said in his ex@@ plan@@ ation to A@@ A reporters that Per@@ se@@ id will reach the highest level at night from Friday , August 12 , to Saturday , August 13 .
stat@@ ing that the Per@@ se@@ id me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wer is formed when thousands of parti@@ c@@ les dri@@ ft apart from the co@@ met named " S@@ wi@@ ft - tut@@ tle " from the effects of the sun and gra@@ v@@ ity , E@@ sen@@ oğlu explained that this situation will become a vis@@ ual fe@@ ast .
E@@ sen@@ oğlu pointed out that the Per@@ se@@ id me@@ te@@ or was discovered for the first time in 18@@ 62 and started to be seen from ear@@ th since the 1990s .
men@@ tioning that the Per@@ se@@ id me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wer can be seen in July and August , E@@ sen@@ oğlu said , " We should watch and care about such a vis@@ ual fe@@ ast coming from the space . "
after all , it is a natural vis@@ ual fe@@ ast .
he said , " I@@ t will aid us in kno@@ wing the uni@@ ver@@ se in a better way . "
they will spar@@ k@@ le red when they are c@@ old , wh@@ ite when they are ho@@ t
he drew attention to the fact that some of the len@@ til @ - @ siz@@ ed parti@@ c@@ les separ@@ ated during the me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wer will drop to ear@@ th , and continued as follows :
Per@@ se@@ id 's temper@@ ature may increase up to 2 thous@@ and de@@ gre@@ es c@@ enti@@ gra@@ de .
because of the he@@ at and fri@@ ction in the atmosphere , the Per@@ se@@ id sho@@ wer pro@@ du@@ ces red light when c@@ old and wh@@ ite light when ho@@ t in their natural environment .
a contribution can be made by wr@@ iting how many M@@ ete@@ ors are seen on the website of the International me@@ te@@ or Organ@@ iz@@ ation .
these data carry valu@@ able information as they are collected from every part of the world .
it will be possible to watch it all night
expla@@ ining that the me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wer trav@@ els at a speed of around 60 km / h , E@@ sen@@ oğlu said that this vis@@ ual fe@@ ast in the sk@@ y can be well seen from places that receive little light in the nor@@ theast direction during the whole night .
expla@@ ining that more than 100 me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wers happen every year , E@@ sen@@ oğlu mentioned that the G@@ emin@@ id me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wer between December 4 @ - @ 17 is a well worth wat@@ ching natural event after the Per@@ se@@ id me@@ te@@ or sho@@ wer .
po@@ or@@ ly edu@@ cated , former football player Erdoğan
the thing that sp@@ o@@ iled the balance is the winning alliance of the pop@@ ul@@ ist Islam@@ ists led by po@@ or@@ ly edu@@ cated former football player Erdoğan and the highly edu@@ cated follow@@ ers of F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , a religious entrepren@@ e@@ ur on a wide scale , who established more than one thous@@ and schools , tens of university and educational institu@@ tes from T@@ ex@@ as to T@@ ash@@ kent .
the above @ - @ written statement is the trans@@ lation of a sentence in an article published in Foreign Policy last week .
Western media often pub@@ lish such ar@@ tic@@ les in which university gradu@@ ate Erdoğan is evalu@@ ated as a po@@ or@@ ly edu@@ cated , former football player and primary school gradu@@ ate Gü@@ len is evalu@@ ated as an entrepren@@ e@@ ur with a broad perspective , and Gü@@ len follow@@ ers are open@@ ly praised .
then , on the other hand , they try to give an ex@@ plan@@ ation with sentences starting with " Bec@@ ause Erdoğan ... " in their ar@@ tic@@ les with the th@@ eme " Wh@@ y is Op@@ position against America and / or the West rising in Turkey ? "
it is possible that the analysts , seeing the opposition against the West in Turkey as an emer@@ gent situation started during the term of Erdoğan , are un@@ aware of the history of Turkey .
in fact , if the statistics are lo@@ oked at , the first ten years of Erdoğan 's term can be interpre@@ ted as a period in which the opposition against the West in Turkey decre@@ ased or remained at an average position .
like@@ wise , good relation@@ ships with the European Union and the United States of America continued harmon@@ i@@ ously .
there are many reasons to be coun@@ ted like the facts that Erdoğan cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ed Israel with ' one @ - @ minute ' ; the E@@ . U@@ . could not put forward a clear policy over the out@@ break of civil war as a result of the Assad government 's massac@@ res , and left Turkey alone in the refugee crisis ; S@@ ome figures like European Parliament President Sch@@ ul@@ z showed con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous behavi@@ or as in the expression " Erdoğan is not our inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or " ; A@@ n off@@ end Erdogan competition was held and was won by the London Mayor at the time and now Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with his po@@ em that includes many uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ ably dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing swe@@ ar words ; PKK 's Syria branch of Y@@ P@@ G is g@@ l@@ ori@@ fied in Europe by opening both exhibi@@ tions and offices while PKK members that entered from Syria to Turkey became suic@@ ide bom@@ bers and sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered tens of our citizens ; US soldiers in Syria we@@ ar uni@@ forms with the Y@@ P@@ G symbol ; its special representative for the struggle against D@@ A@@ ES@@ H , B@@ ret@@ t Mc@@ G@@ ur@@ k , paid special visits to the Y@@ P@@ G ; while the opposition groups that don ' t pose a threat to Turkey , such as the Y@@ P@@ G , are left alone , all the intelligence and log@@ istic supports are given to the Y@@ P@@ G ; Turkey 's struggle against D@@ A@@ ES@@ H was under@@ estimated and the number of our troops was decre@@ ased in Mos@@ ul because of Bag@@ h@@ da@@ d government op@@ pres@@ sion and U@@ SA support .
let 's say that we for@@ got the fact that while we lost 2@@ 47 people as a result of the blo@@ ody coup , there was no support for our democracy from our so called allies from E@@ . U@@ . countries and the U@@ SA until the failure of the coup was pro@@ ven ; Ker@@ ry said that they expect the establishment of " peace and stability in Turkey " and did not emphas@@ ize the democracy and the elected government .
how can we for@@ get that when 11 Char@@ li@@ e H@@ eb@@ do employees were killed in Paris , many leaders around the world including Turkey participated in the protest mar@@ ch but there is no " ally " of the President of Turkey from Western countries that came in sp@@ ite of the fact that one month has passed from the coup attempt in which 2@@ 47 people res@@ isting the tan@@ ks for the s@@ ake of democracy were killed ?
what can we say about the fact that lower ran@@ k representatives were sent by leaders who came several times or sent higher ran@@ k representatives over the matter of refugees ?
how can we evalu@@ ate the fact that all the E@@ . U@@ . and U@@ SA ambassadors paid a get @ - @ well visit when the win@@ dow of the Hurriyet newspaper was bro@@ ken but they have not paid any solidarity visit to the bomb@@ ed Turkish Grand National Assembly ?
when is re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed is that the E@@ . U sent high ranking representatives and sho@@ ok hands with the coup leader S@@ isi within the first two weeks of the coup that took place in Egypt , and Ker@@ ry g@@ l@@ ori@@ fied the coup leaders by saying , " democracy is re @ - @ established " in his visit after the coup . is it too ab@@ normal that when the Western countries , ab@@ st@@ ain@@ ing from supporting Turkey in the res@@ istance of democracy , express that they are concerned about Turkish democracy , it is not found to be s@@ inc@@ ere in Turkey ?
in fact , it is sufficient to inf@@ ur@@ i@@ ate Turkish people by even allowing Gü@@ len , who is considered responsible for the coup by 95 % of the people , to live fre@@ ely in the U@@ SA .
when we ad@@ d the back@@ ground stated above , I think it is clear that the opposition towards the West / U@@ SA is not a situation that can be explained only by Erdoğan .
again , Erdoğan still has not even said that he thinks the U@@ SA had an impact on the coup ...
so it means that the bal@@ lot bo@@ x is not an un@@ important deta@@ il by no means
do the Ge@@ zi min@@ ded people , under@@ estima@@ ting their people , saying , " the bal@@ lot bo@@ x is an un@@ important deta@@ il " and hum@@ ili@@ ating the voters that do not think the same as " ig@@ nor@@ ant people that s@@ cr@@ at@@ ch their bel@@ ly , " sing from the same song s@@ he@@ et after the July 15 night ?
I won@@ der whether they sear@@ ched for an answer to the question , " W@@ here were we mist@@ ak@@ en ? " after seeing that these people protected the state and democracy .
but there are so many questions to be ans@@ w@@ ered .
being tra@@ itors after having served in various ranks until y@@ es@@ ter@@ day and receiving the right to use the weapons of the state , the com@@ mission@@ ed officers accepted in an in@@ stan@@ t to enter the status of " tra@@ it@@ or " and requested asylum from foreign states .
we should see what kind of a ment@@ ally de@@ formed environment we live in and how the ob@@ session against the people lead people to the behavi@@ or that can be described as her@@ es@@ y .
Bra@@ in@@ was@@ hed when it comes to coup attempt ...
was there any vie@@ w@@ point other than lik@@ ening Turkey 's cities to Syria 's cities for those who participated in this movement ?
why does a com@@ mission@@ ed officer bomb the parliament of his own country ?
we should not have fal@@ len into the er@@ ror of expec@@ ting reas@@ onable behavi@@ or from people bra@@ in@@ was@@ hed with the mal@@ edi@@ c@@ tions of FE@@ T@@ O .
others are responsible B@@ ut we should know FE@@ T@@ O is not the only one responsible for everything .
the people who present politics as an occup@@ ation of quar@@ re@@ ling , gru@@ dges , and hat@@ red made the necessary contributions to the tra@@ ge@@ dies experienced .
the rec@@ k@@ less people who present themselves as " en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed " make the mas@@ ses believe that all kin@@ ds of an@@ om@@ al@@ ous behavi@@ or , or even im@@ pu@@ dence , is natural .
finally , we saw how the people who h@@ ate their own people commen@@ ced fire against these people when they received a gun .
the way of democracy , the way we know
I am saying a simple thing : the people in Turkey lost 250 m@@ art@@ y@@ r@@ s to the FE@@ T@@ O member par@@ asi@@ tes , w@@ ay@@ lay@@ ers and in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators within the army and established democracy rather than lose it on the evening of July 15 .
behind July 15 , there are three peri@@ ods ; 1992 @ - @ 2002 ; 2002 @ - @ 2012 ; 2012 and after .
there are three changes prepared in these three peri@@ ods : economic , social and political .
two big phenom@@ ena prepared the social change : immig@@ ration from rural areas to me@@ tro@@ polis@@ es and movement of these mig@@ rants to the cen@@ ters after being kept on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of the cities for a long time .
I stated on Wednesday that this movement happened via the me@@ tr@@ o .
I also said , ' do not under@@ esti@@ mate the me@@ tr@@ o ' and stressed that it is the most important social change factor .
the second biggest change in the same direction is bri@@ dges and roads .
the contribution of roads and bri@@ dges to the moderniz@@ ation is more easily under@@ stood .
a road is introduced , economic and social structures change .
in our case , it also changed the political structure in the same way .
I determined all along this history of the bri@@ dges that were construc@@ ted across the Bos@@ ph@@ or@@ us in İstanbul .
Dem@@ i@@ rel built the Bos@@ ph@@ or@@ us Bri@@ dge .
this was the pe@@ ak of the post @ - @ 19@@ 5@@ 0s pe@@ as@@ ant movement in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s .
Öz@@ al continued the progress in this direction with the second bridge , the name of which has changed to July 15 Mart@@ y@@ r@@ s Bri@@ dge .
even the ro@@ utes of these roads show the relationship established between the per@@ ip@@ her@@ y @ - @ cen@@ ter .
it is the sign of what kind of a social change path is followed .
Dem@@ ir@@ al and Öz@@ al 's aim was to me@@ l@@ t the big mas@@ ses in the cen@@ ter .
it was to make them adopt the ide@@ ology of the cen@@ ter .
the AK Party did not build the third bridge for many years .
because the immig@@ ration continued at full speed .
the in@@ coming people were placed in the sa@@ tel@@ li@@ te cities .
a some@@ what closed system was created in those regions .
the AK Party 's local management gave the people food , jobs and social status ; they gave their vote to the AK Party .
in this way , the mas@@ ses acquired their political awareness on the per@@ ip@@ her@@ y and then came to the cen@@ ter as " themselves . "
this development is related to the ongoing discussions about the head@@ scar@@ f before the AK Party ( 1992 @ - @ 2002 ) .
these discussions accepted the necess@@ ity of conservative , mutual , and prov@@ in@@ cial people not to be c@@ entr@@ al@@ ized but to stand side by side .
after 2002 , the AK Party acted with the meth@@ od I stated , politici@@ z@@ ed the mas@@ ses , integrated them into the politics and ma@@ tured them .
after that , now pay attention to this , 3 . bridge construction is si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ous with the democratic struggle on July 15 .
that is to say , history and soci@@ ology over@@ lap@@ ped .
let me ad@@ d one more di@@ men@@ sion : AK Party 's move I mentioned is not limited to İstanbul 's bri@@ dges .
a more interes@@ ting thing happen@@ s : now the AK Party is integr@@ ating per@@ ip@@ h@@ eral cities with central cities .
this is en@@ su@@ red via two bri@@ dges .
the first one is Osman@@ gaz@@ i Bri@@ dge .
the second one is Ç@@ an@@ ak@@ kal@@ e 19@@ 15 Bri@@ dge .
ad@@ d roads to this .
Turkey will reach İz@@ mir from Th@@ race via another route now .
do you know what this means ? İz@@ mir will become an ut@@ ter@@ ly different city from now on .
let 's say that the AK Party will win İz@@ mir from the ' outside ' , as it could not win from the ' inside . '
from now on , the cities of Bur@@ sa , Ç@@ an@@ ak@@ kal@@ e and Th@@ race will be trans@@ formed into other human and social geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ es .
that 's it !
the July 15 m@@ art@@ y@@ r@@ s are the st@@ ars of this big ad@@ venture .
happy training in F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe with Van Per@@ si@@ e
F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe continued preparations for the G@@ rap@@ ph@@ op@@ p@@ ers match with training in the morning .
starting under the management of technical director Vit@@ or Per@@ e@@ ir@@ a at 10.@@ 00 in C@@ an B@@ art@@ u Fac@@ il@@ ities , training took 1 hour 30 minutes in total .

training was completed with two goal , small area , mat@@ ches .
F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe will continue preparations with training this evening .
that person who made a compla@@ int to Gü@@ len about Az@@ iz Yıl@@ dır@@ ım ...
new developments took place regarding the Mat@@ ch @ - @ Fi@@ x@@ ing Oper@@ ation against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe .
participating in a TV program broadcast on CNN Türk , and expla@@ ining that this operation was made by FE@@ T@@ O , the journalist H@@ ü@@ sey@@ in Gü@@ lerce said , " So@@ me@@ one from the sports world conv@@ ey@@ ed to F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len the remarks made by Az@@ iz Yıl@@ dır@@ ım about him . "
one day , Yıl@@ dır@@ ım expressed some words to this person like " Wh@@ at are you doing with F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len . "
when this person conv@@ ey@@ ed these remarks to Gü@@ len , F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len became ob@@ ses@@ sed with Az@@ iz Yıl@@ dır@@ ım .
why did he become ob@@ ses@@ sed with Az@@ iz Yıl@@ dır@@ ım ?
with the idea that if the president of the club that has the biggest number of supporters is in this state of mind , he may damage himself .
he expressed , " The Mat@@ ch @ - @ fi@@ x@@ ing case was to elimin@@ ate Az@@ iz Yıl@@ dır@@ ım . "
after these words , another ex@@ plan@@ ation came from F@@ a@@ ik I@@ ş@@ ık , who is one of the most important lawyers in the Mat@@ ch @ - @ Fi@@ x@@ ing C@@ ase .
I@@ ş@@ ık participated in the TV program Karş@@ ıt Gör@@ üş broadcast on Haber@@ tür@@ k , and announced the person who compla@@ ined about Az@@ iz Yıl@@ dır@@ ım to FE@@ T@@ O r@@ ing@@ leader F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len .
here are the remarks of F@@ a@@ ik I@@ ş@@ ık :
Az@@ iz Yıl@@ dır@@ ım said something to İh@@ san K@@ alk@@ av@@ an about F@@ eth@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len .
in a private plan@@ e while travel@@ ing from Azerbai@@ jan .
Mr@@ . Az@@ iz is a wit@@ ty man , he also speaks with st@@ inging expres@@ sions when cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ ing someone .
these st@@ inging expres@@ sions can sometimes draw blo@@ od .
some people may show a reaction to these expres@@ sions .
these expres@@ sions are conv@@ ey@@ ed to some@@ where .
businessmen bringing to@@ wel@@ s and offering fav@@ ors and money as if they were going to Haj@@ j , U@@ m@@ ra@@ h , can not be toler@@ ated .
he says what the hel@@ l it is , he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ z@@ es very sever@@ ely .
the only problem is not this for sure .
meanwhile , a football team pic@@ k was organiz@@ ed .
direct relation@@ ships between some football players and man@@ agers from Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay and Hak@@ an Ş@@ ükü@@ r ...
Mu@@ har@@ re@@ m US@@ TA : match @ - @ fi@@ x@@ ing is different
Tra@@ b@@ z@@ on@@ spor President Mu@@ har@@ re@@ m US@@ TA offered a friendly hand to F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe .
expla@@ ining that Turkey 's issue is the issue of all the clu@@ bs , US@@ TA said , " We are on the side of this country with 7@@ 9 million . "
we should maintain a strong stance .
if there is a problem of F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe with FE@@ T@@ O , if an in@@ justice is done to someone , I will also stand behind F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe .
he said , " H@@ ow@@ ever , the matter of match @ - @ fi@@ x@@ ing between Tra@@ b@@ z@@ on@@ spor and F@@ ener@@ bah@@ çe is different . "
the price of sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ial anim@@ als was announced
Kar@@ ab@@ ul@@ ut said the following : " we , as the Union , determined the kg price of living sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ial cal@@ ves as 18 li@@ ra . "

moreover , it is also very important that the an@@ imal is health@@ y .
to do this , our citizens can chec@@ k the vac@@ cin@@ ations in the anim@@ als ' pass@@ port when buying a sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ial an@@ imal .
in terms of ou@@ ter appearance , the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ial an@@ imal should be li@@ vely and fresh , and it should have lost its bab@@ y ha@@ ir .
there should not be any indic@@ ations like sal@@ iv@@ a , sli@@ me on its face .
we saw that anim@@ als that were not sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ial last year were put on sale and sold .
a sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ial an@@ imal needs to be 2 years old .
we understand this by looking at the an@@ imal 's te@@ eth .
te@@ eth that we descri@@ be as " ca@@ p " must have gro@@ wn on an an@@ imal that is 2 years old .
however , these te@@ eth have not gro@@ wn on youn@@ ger anim@@ als .
the an@@ imal may look old in appearance but its ca@@ p te@@ eth may not grow .
as the ca@@ p te@@ eth are bigger than the others , they are immediately no@@ tic@@ ed .

stri@@ king expres@@ sions from Robert Am@@ ster@@ dam about FE@@ T@@ O !
an official from the Am@@ ster@@ dam & Part@@ ners law company which jur@@ isti@@ cally investig@@ ates the internationally illegal activities of the F@@ et@@ ul@@ l@@ lah Ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist Organ@@ iz@@ ation ( FE@@ T@@ O ) , Robert Am@@ ster@@ dam shared information with the U@@ SA magazine For@@ bes by wr@@ iting an article about how FE@@ T@@ O is organiz@@ ed .
stat@@ ing that FE@@ T@@ O r@@ ing@@ leader F@@ et@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len man@@ ages the organiz@@ ation from his man@@ sion in Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Am@@ ster@@ dam stated , " Wh@@ en we look closely at how Gü@@ len oper@@ ates around 150 char@@ ter schools in the U@@ SA , it will be clearly seen that the organiz@@ ation has a secret under@@ ground organiz@@ ational cap@@ ability of the highest degree . "
expla@@ ining that he was t@@ asked by Turkey with the duty of investig@@ ating Gü@@ len connected companies and schools seven months ago , Am@@ ster@@ dam stressed that their findings until now are " sho@@ cking . "
Am@@ ster@@ dam shared the following opinions in his article :
according to the information we received from the den@@ un@@ ci@@ ators , the Gü@@ len organiz@@ ation has a ri@@ g@@ id hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y in which in@@ struc@@ tions are conv@@ ey@@ ed .
these in@@ struc@@ tions are generally conv@@ ey@@ ed to Po@@ con@@ os during face to face meetings with Gü@@ len .
on the top , there is a management group ( consul@@ tation group ) cons@@ isting of seven people .
this group conv@@ ey@@ s the in@@ struc@@ tions to the advis@@ ory committee .
from this , the in@@ struc@@ tions go , respectively , to regional ima@@ ms , country ima@@ ms , regional ima@@ ms within the country , prov@@ in@@ cial ima@@ ms , regional ima@@ ms within the prov@@ inc@@ es , neigh@@ bor@@ hood ima@@ ms , ima@@ ms of the student houses ( houses of light ) and the students .
the businessmen , bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats and com@@ mission@@ ed officers are working at various levels in accordance with their position in the organiz@@ ation and their support .
stat@@ ing that the organiz@@ ation opened 55 thous@@ and places of business all over the world and has the wide@@ st char@@ ter school network , Am@@ ster@@ dam said that millions of dol@@ lar@@ s are given to these schools from the taxes paid by American tax@@ pay@@ ers every year .
Am@@ ster@@ dam wrote that most of this money is directed by the organiz@@ ation members and transferred to the " chosen " sub@@ contr@@ acting companies .
Am@@ ster@@ dam explained this process with these examp@@ les :
Mag@@ n@@ ol@@ ia schools , established in C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia , was caught while giving 700 thous@@ and dol@@ lar@@ s to a Gü@@ len connected company , with which it shares the same office , in return for the service contract .
Am@@ ster@@ dam showed Do@@ ve Science Academy in Ok@@ lah@@ om@@ a as another example .
Am@@ ster@@ dam noted that also this school paid 3.@@ 1 million dol@@ lar@@ s more to the land@@ lor@@ d , and it was determined in the au@@ dit that the management of the school and land@@ lor@@ d cons@@ isted of the same people who are connected to Gü@@ len .
drawing attention to the fact that there are similar situ@@ ations in Har@@ mon@@ y schools , which have 46 bran@@ ches and occup@@ ies the biggest place in the Gü@@ len network , Am@@ ster@@ dam stated that money was paid to the Gü@@ len connected smaller companies for such items as software licen@@ ses , receiving of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
under@@ lining the fact that the structures within FE@@ T@@ O make each other rich , Am@@ ster@@ dam said , " The examp@@ les I gave show that around 28 million dol@@ lar@@ s from American tax@@ pay@@ ers are mis@@ used . "
he added , " moreover , this is the visible part of what we found up until now . "
indic@@ ating that nothing was done to prevent this kind of thing up until now , Am@@ ster@@ dam said that the situation got much worse over the course of time , and upon this , the T@@ ex@@ as Education Agency started to investigate the irregularities .
Am@@ ster@@ dam stressed that the schools operate nor@@ m@@ ally on the sur@@ face , and many employees do not know anything about the kind of corruption taking place .
Am@@ ster@@ dam said , " H@@ ow@@ ever , in fact , these schools work like a profit mach@@ ine for Gü@@ len . "
he de@@ duced , " Gu@@ len then uses the huge amount of money for political don@@ ations to conce@@ al his illegal activities . "
saying that , according to statements from a former American educ@@ ator who worked in these schools , some employees in Gü@@ len schools had separate meetings and transferred an amount from their wages to the organiz@@ ation , Am@@ ster@@ dam said , " I@@ t is believed that Gü@@ len members in the Turkish Ar@@ med Forces are working in a similar way . "
coup pl@@ ot@@ ters strength@@ ened their position over the years .
he wrote , " H@@ ow@@ ever , while the army oper@@ ates in a normal way on the sur@@ face , a parallel power was collec@@ ting power behind the scen@@ es . "
Am@@ ster@@ dam finished his article as follows :
there are question marks in the min@@ ds of the polic@@ y@@ makers in the U@@ SA about July 15 @ - @ 16 and the incidents after that and this is an expected thing .
however , those in state authorities should real@@ ize that U@@ SA laws are viola@@ ted ser@@ ially in Gü@@ len 's operations while dealing with the situation of the two allies on the diplomatic level .

be car@@ eful of this children 's ha@@ bit
Faculty of denti@@ stry As@@ soci@@ ate Pro@@ f@@ . Dr. Bil@@ gin G@@ ira@@ y said that children turn suc@@ king into a necess@@ ity and rela@@ x through this ref@@ le@@ x because they can not ch@@ ew at an early age .
expla@@ ining the reasons why the th@@ um@@ b suc@@ king ha@@ bit is seen in children , As@@ soci@@ ate Pro@@ f@@ . Dr. G@@ ira@@ y said , " th@@ um@@ b suc@@ king is a circum@@ stance seen from birth until 3 @ - @ 4 years of age . "

the phy@@ si@@ ological ref@@ lection of this is speech dis@@ order and a bad appearance when closing in terms of a@@ es@@ the@@ tics .
drawing attention to the fact that a more complex treatment process may be experienced at 6 @ - @ 7 years of age when permanent te@@ eth start to grow if an early solution is not found , As@@ soci@@ ate Pro@@ f@@ .

a new push for near vision treatment : Tri@@ fo@@ cal len@@ ses
after the treatment of cat@@ ar@@ acts , patients n@@ atur@@ ally do not want to use g@@ l@@ ass@@ es .
M@@ ulti@@ fo@@ cal len@@ ses have already been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients .
the success of the treatment in this area is taken further with tri@@ fo@@ cal len@@ ses , which started to be used recently .
the difference of tri@@ fo@@ cal len@@ ses from other len@@ ses is their ability to provide clear vision at not only long or close dist@@ ances but also in dist@@ ances that can be defined as inter@@ medi@@ ary dist@@ ances .
the treatment of long , close or inter@@ medi@@ ary dist@@ ance vision dis@@ orders
inter@@ medi@@ ary dist@@ ance in vision dis@@ orders represents a point we frequ@@ ently use in our daily life .
for example , the display panel of cars , por@@ table computers we hold on our la@@ p or the dist@@ ance we def@@ ine as 60 @ - @ 70 c@@ m , ar@@ m 's len@@ g@@ th , are inter@@ medi@@ ary dist@@ ances .
thanks also to the correc@@ tion of inter@@ medi@@ ary dist@@ ances by tri@@ fo@@ cal len@@ ses , our patients do not need to use g@@ l@@ ass@@ es under any circumstances , whether close or long .
another advantage provided by tri@@ fo@@ cal len@@ ses is that they reduce ni@@ gh@@ t@@ time complaints .
Op@@ to@@ me@@ tr@@ ist Assistant Pro@@ f@@ . Dr. V@@ ol@@ kan Hür@@ mer@@ iç said , " Ap@@ p@@ lied for all dist@@ ance vision treat@@ ments , tri@@ fo@@ cal len@@ s treatment has no difference from normal cat@@ ar@@ act treatment . "
our patients , to whom we applied tri@@ fo@@ cal treatment , rec@@ over their eye health easily with a 7 @ - @ 10 minute procedure .
and our patients can return to their normal life the next day .
it is an operation that ra@@ ises the quality of life especially for people who use a car , use a computer a lot , love reading , and have a more active life .
you can cons@@ ult an op@@ to@@ me@@ tr@@ ist to learn whether this procedure , which can be applied to all patients over 18 years old , is also appropriate for you or not .
Var@@ ic@@ ose ve@@ ins are not used in heart operations !
Var@@ ic@@ ose is a dis@@ ease which is increasing in frequ@@ ency in recent years .
primarily affected by gen@@ e@@ tic pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity , long working hours , jobs that require standing for a long period and s@@ it@@ ting for a long period have caused an increase in complaints of var@@ ic@@ ose .
can the ve@@ ins be used in heart operations ?
the questions like , " I have var@@ ic@@ ose , what is done if I have a heart attack in the future ? " are frequ@@ ently asked by people .
here are the ans@@ wers to these questions .
there are two ty@@ pes of ve@@ in system in the leg@@ s :
1 . in the le@@ g , there is a ve@@ in system that we call the main path which carri@@ es ven@@ ous blo@@ od to the l@@ un@@ gs and collec@@ ts the main ven@@ ous blo@@ od of the le@@ g .
these are named the deep fem@@ or@@ al ve@@ in and super@@ fic@@ ial fem@@ or@@ al ve@@ in .
these problems in the ve@@ ins are seen less often , the ves@@ sel can not be closed during ill@@ ness and medical treatment is applied to keep these ve@@ ins open .
in the le@@ g , there is a super@@ fic@@ ial ve@@ in system which we ref@@ er to as the la@@ ter@@ al p@@ ath@@ way that carri@@ es ven@@ ous blo@@ od to the l@@ un@@ gs and in@@ te@@ gra@@ tes with the deep ve@@ in system in the gro@@ in .
this system cons@@ ists of two big and two small ve@@ ins we call s@@ ap@@ hen@@ a .
defic@@ i@@ ency and var@@ ic@@ ose grow in all of these four ves@@ sels .
the ve@@ ins , which can be used in heart operations , are the super@@ fic@@ ial ve@@ ins called big s@@ ap@@ hen@@ a .
a lack of these ves@@ sels does not cause any har@@ m to the body and for this reason , they can be used in heart operations .
however , the ves@@ sels should be health@@ y for these ves@@ sels to be used in a heart operation .
because the heart is a vital organ .
the operation of re@@ moving var@@ ic@@ ose ve@@ ins or bur@@ ning with a las@@ er by leaving them in place via an operation re@@ du@@ ces the work@@ lo@@ ad of deep ve@@ ins and en@@ sures that the le@@ g is health@@ ier .
it is w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly believed among people that the ves@@ sels can be used as a spar@@ e even if they have var@@ ic@@ ose .
Var@@ ic@@ ose ve@@ ins are never ever used in heart operations !
there are other ves@@ sels that can be used in heart operations .
the spar@@ e ves@@ sel systems that can be used in heart operations are under the ri@@ b c@@ age , around the sto@@ ma@@ ch and ar@@ m .
therefore , keeping var@@ ic@@ ose ve@@ ins to use for the heart and wor@@ ries about this issue are gro@@ un@@ dless .

S@@ co@@ t Cal@@ lum S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ ms home as Br@@ its gra@@ b cy@@ cl@@ ing gold
Scot@@ land 's Cal@@ lum S@@ kin@@ ner rac@@ ed to g@@ l@@ ory in the men 's team sp@@ r@@ int at the R@@ io v@@ el@@ od@@ ro@@ me last night as the Te@@ am G@@ B tri@@ o def@@ ended the title from London 2012 .
the G@@ las@@ we@@ gi@@ an 23 @ - @ year @ - @ old was in the an@@ ch@@ or role that his fellow Scot@@ sman S@@ ir Ch@@ ris H@@ oy made his own and the youn@@ g@@ s@@ ter did the legen@@ d pro@@ ud as he stor@@ med home to sn@@ at@@ ch victory from the fav@@ oured New Ze@@ al@@ and out@@ f@@ it .
Britain claimed a sho@@ ck victory four years ago to win as H@@ oy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gol@@ ds .
and they repe@@ ated the tri@@ ck after fin@@ ishing a low@@ ly sixth at March 's Tr@@ ack World Cha@@ mpion@@ ships in London , despite H@@ oy having since retired .
the issue between Beijing and London was re@@ placing speci@@ alist Star@@ ter J@@ am@@ ie Staff .
they did so just in time as Hin@@ des emerged .
H@@ oy 's reti@@ rement also created a vo@@ id which K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Mat@@ t C@@ ra@@ mp@@ ton tried to f@@ ill .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man Britain 's co@@ aches st@@ uc@@ k with , seeing potential in the S@@ co@@ t which has now been re@@ alised .
Hin@@ des , Ken@@ ny - champ@@ ions with H@@ oy four years ago - and S@@ kin@@ ner set an Olympic record in qual@@ if@@ ying , but the standard was over@@ taken by New Ze@@ al@@ and in the first round .
and the British tri@@ o won the du@@ el for gold .
Hin@@ des was nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly behind after his la@@ p , but Ken@@ ny pus@@ hed the team in front and S@@ kin@@ ner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with Hin@@ des ri@@ ding a bigger ge@@ ar to slow him down and allow Ken@@ ny and , in particular , S@@ kin@@ ner to keep pace .
H@@ oy wat@@ ched on from his position as a BBC pun@@ dit and caught the eye of S@@ kin@@ ner , Ken@@ ny and Hin@@ des when they stepped on to the po@@ di@@ um .
the 23 @ - @ year @ - @ old S@@ kin@@ ner , from G@@ las@@ go@@ w , said : " it 's a f@@ lat@@ tering compar@@ ison . "
I 'm just out there to do my best and make a name for my@@ self .
we set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champ@@ ions .
it was just incre@@ di@@ ble .
there 's no better way to win it .
after tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ing at London 2012 al@@ ong@@ side Ken@@ ny and H@@ oy , Hin@@ des admitted to de@@ liber@@ ately fal@@ ling to the track following a poor start .
he later re@@ tr@@ acted the comment and there was no meth@@ od of appeal from Britain 's ri@@ v@@ als .
there was no such issue this time around in a su@@ preme victory .
Hin@@ des said : " it felt like London , with all the G@@ B fla@@ gs in the stand . "
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we 've been losing out on so many world ti@@ t@@ les , so to win the Olympics again is just amaz@@ ing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track ti@@ t@@ les in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ome@@ ter of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the v@@ el@@ od@@ ro@@ me a@@ wa@@ its .
with the form Ken@@ ny demonstrated , it is not beyond the real@@ ms of possibility to ima@@ g@@ ine him repe@@ ating H@@ oy 's fe@@ at of winning three Olympic gol@@ ds in one Games .
that would see Ken@@ ny - who is exac@@ tly 12 years youn@@ ger than H@@ oy , who is also born on 23 March ( that seem@@ ingly sac@@ red date in British s@@ port which is also the bir@@ th@@ day of Ste@@ ve R@@ ed@@ gra@@ ve , M@@ o Far@@ ah and Ro@@ ger Ban@@ n@@ ister ) - take his t@@ ally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as H@@ oy 's .
Ken@@ ny next com@@ pe@@ tes in the sp@@ r@@ int , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28 @ - @ year @ - @ old from B@@ ol@@ ton said : " I 'm just enjoy@@ ing this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your ma@@ tes .
it 's a bit l@@ on@@ ely winning on your own to be hon@@ est .
Hin@@ des said : " if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a k@@ ni@@ gh@@ tho@@ od . "
it was the day 's only medal event , but there was further good news for Britain .
S@@ ir Bra@@ d@@ ley W@@ ig@@ gin@@ s , E@@ d C@@ lan@@ cy , Ste@@ ven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Do@@ ul@@ l quali@@ fied fas@@ test in the four @ - @ man , four @ - @ kil@@ o@@ metres team pursu@@ it .
they finished in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 43 .
the world record , set in winning gold at London 2012 , is 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round and final ( 10.@@ 42 p@@ m ) take place on today 's second day of action , where W@@ ig@@ gin@@ s is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with com@@ mis@@ sa@@ i@@ res y@@ es@@ ter@@ day ahead of the qual@@ ification ri@@ de , when officials sum@@ mon@@ ed him to measure his he@@ ight .
in the correspon@@ ding women 's event , which re@@ su@@ mes and conclu@@ des tom@@ or@@ row , Laura T@@ rot@@ t , Jo@@ an@@ na Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ ark@@ er and K@@ ati@@ e Ar@@ chi@@ bal@@ d of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie advanced in a world record time , c@@ loc@@ king 4 : 13@@ .@@ 2@@ 60 .
team G@@ B have come to rely on its m@@ igh@@ ty track cy@@ cl@@ ing squ@@ ad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals .
after tr@@ uly excep@@ tional sho@@ w@@ ings of ut@@ ter domin@@ ance at Beijing and London , expectations have been played down in the lead @ - @ up to R@@ io .
there have been dra@@ mas in the back@@ ground , not least the resignation of technical director Shan@@ e S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid se@@ x@@ ism and bul@@ lying allegations , and the reti@@ re@@ ments of giant figures like H@@ oy and Vic@@ tor@@ ia P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , on the evidence of the first night 's rac@@ ing in the v@@ el@@ od@@ ro@@ me , it looks like G@@ B 's now legen@@ dary rep@@ ut@@ ation for pe@@ ak@@ ing at the per@@ f@@ ect time could be about to be repe@@ ated once again .
Port@@ land s@@ me@@ l@@ ter 's future in doubt with a@@ x@@ ing of power contract
the future of the Port@@ land al@@ um@@ in@@ ium s@@ me@@ l@@ ter in Vic@@ tor@@ ia - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant dis@@ closing one of the plant 's owners is to termin@@ ate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be a@@ xed .
the move follows the decision of the Vic@@ tor@@ ia government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20 @ - @ year fixed subsi@@ dy ex@@ pi@@ res in November .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Al@@ co@@ a 's Port@@ land plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indi@@ rec@@ t - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional kno@@ ck @ - @ on effects since the s@@ me@@ l@@ ter consu@@ mes around 10 per cent of Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's entire electricity output .
in 2014 , Al@@ co@@ a closed the Po@@ int Hen@@ ry s@@ me@@ l@@ ter which led to the closure last year of the An@@ g@@ le@@ sea power plant .
Al@@ co@@ a 's Port@@ land s@@ me@@ l@@ ter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong Austral@@ ian dol@@ lar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the big al@@ um@@ in@@ ium s@@ me@@ l@@ ter with electricity from its L@@ oy Yan@@ g A power plant in the L@@ atro@@ be Val@@ ley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to termin@@ ate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , with China 's C@@ I@@ T@@ IC and Japan 's Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p holding smaller shares .
" AG@@ L expects the Port@@ land facility to continue to operate , mean@@ ing phy@@ sical demand for electricity from the s@@ me@@ l@@ ter will continue , " it said .
AG@@ L said the contracts are so @ - @ called ' h@@ ed@@ ging contracts ' which were due to take effect from November 20@@ 16 .
the contracts have a 12 @ - @ month termin@@ ation period so they will actually finish in 20@@ 17 .
" as such , AG@@ L continues to expect the contracts to contribute to ear@@ nings in fiscal year 17 , " the power company said .
any potential ear@@ nings impact on AG@@ L from F@@ Y@@ 18 on@@ wards is currently limited by the strong fut@@ ures market outlook for wh@@ o@@ le@@ sale electricity prices .
AG@@ L said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 18@@ 7 million in " anticip@@ ation of a termin@@ ation event . "
Al@@ co@@ a said the decision to close out the contracts " does not affect Al@@ co@@ a 's ... ability to operate the s@@ me@@ l@@ ter or secure electricity supply to the s@@ me@@ l@@ ter . "
the US company said it entered into a 20 @ - @ year contract with L@@ oy Yan@@ g in 2010 , which was due to commen@@ ce from November this year , although it has yet to expla@@ in why it has pul@@ led out of the contract .
analysts have been w@@ ary of the possible closure of both of the Port@@ land s@@ me@@ l@@ ter in Vic@@ tor@@ ia and also the To@@ ma@@ go plant near New@@ c@@ ast@@ le due to the poor econom@@ ics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , AG@@ L 's head of operations , Ste@@ ph@@ en Mik@@ k@@ el@@ sen said Port@@ land uses around 600 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of power annually and To@@ ma@@ go around 900 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts .
if both of those plants go from the market that 's a significant reduction in demand in the [ electricity ] market .
and as a gener@@ ator that wo@@ uldn ' t be good for us , " he said .
not just a Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all 's on the cover of September 's Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth da@@ ughter of mother @ - @ manager Kri@@ s 's Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an @ - @ J@@ en@@ ner cl@@ an , is on the cover of US Vo@@ gue 's c@@ ov@@ e@@ ted September issue .
K@@ end@@ all , who is an E@@ ste@@ e L@@ au@@ der br@@ and ambassador and has w@@ alk@@ ed in Milan , Paris and New York fas@@ hion weeks , announced the news on her In@@ st@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
" in a room with a bun@@ ch of people I love , looking at this cover made me cr@@ y , " K@@ end@@ all wrote .
the cover reve@@ lation was followed by a bi@@ zar@@ re ( or simply keeping U@@ p with the Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ ans @ - @ es@@ que ? ) , s@@ cri@@ p@@ ted reality video that featured the entire Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an @ - @ J@@ en@@ ner family ( bar troub@@ le@@ makers Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n , and joined by everyone 's favour@@ ite sho@@ w@@ biz unc@@ le , keeping U@@ p producer R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) for@@ getting about their s@@ ister 's cover , only to end with the clas@@ sic tw@@ ist : they were all planning a surprise party .
it 's the cli@@ che plo@@ t line of nearly every " bir@@ th@@ day " ep@@ iso@@ de of a children 's television show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest deli@@ vers the line , " Y@@ ou thought we for@@ got about you ? , " with the s@@ inc@@ er@@ ity of a car@@ to@@ on rab@@ bit in an 8 am ti@@ mes@@ lot ) , but Kri@@ s had to get her other gir@@ ls in on this public@@ ity some@@ how .
because , with a sp@@ ot on Vo@@ gue 's September issue , we have su@@ rely entered a new era of Kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an .
K@@ end@@ all 's big s@@ ister K@@ im may have be@@ aten her to the cover of Vo@@ gue ( she shared it with hus@@ band Kan@@ ye West in April 2014 ) , but the magazine 's September cover is a le@@ ague un@@ to itself .
the September Is@@ su@@ e is Vo@@ gue 's highest selling edition of the year .
with a th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness more closely re@@ sem@@ b@@ ling a co@@ ffe@@ e table book than a fas@@ hion magazine , the issue attr@@ acts a huge number of adver@@ tis@@ ers ( F@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a coun@@ ted 6@@ 15 of last year 's 8@@ 32 @ - @ page T@@ ome as adverti@@ sing content ) .
the reve@@ lation of its cover star is so h@@ ot@@ ly anticip@@ ated that , in the past two years , pic@@ tures of the magazine have been le@@ ak@@ ed before the official announcement .
previous women to feature on the cover include Na@@ om@@ i C@@ amp@@ bel@@ l , Linda E@@ van@@ gel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate mos@@ s .
in recent years , the cover has certainly featured more " cele@@ bri@@ ties who model " than " mode@@ ls who are cele@@ bri@@ ties . "
Os@@ car winner and Di@@ or ambassador J@@ en@@ ni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was featured in 2013 , the year after L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a had the honour .
but , even on the off @ - @ chance that M@@ s J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the " break@@ out model " of her generation - falls into the former category , she is in pre@@ t@@ ty good company .
these cele@@ bri@@ ties are not relatives of famous people , or reality st@@ ars , or ki@@ ds these days who know how to make a good S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ at video ( although J@@ en@@ ner is all of these things ) .
they are legiti@@ mately tal@@ ented women , ex@@ cel@@ ling in the entertainment industry .
Bey@@ once , who appeared on last year 's cover , has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of le@@ mon@@ ade .
of course , not everyone is ple@@ ased about J@@ en@@ ner 's success .
with her reality television history , J@@ en@@ ner 's position within the fas@@ hion world was always going to be fra@@ ught .
in June , original Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's Sec@@ ret model Ste@@ phan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our criticised J@@ en@@ ner and her colle@@ ague G@@ ig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d , calling them the " bit@@ ches of the moment . "
this sen@@ ti@@ ment has bo@@ iled up again with the news of J@@ en@@ ner 's Vo@@ gue cover appearance .
but d@@ wel@@ ling on the dis@@ content seems bes@@ ide the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September Is@@ su@@ e of Vo@@ gue .
she is a super@@ model , in the pu@@ rest sense of the word .
she 's w@@ alk@@ ing for Mar@@ c J@@ ac@@ ob@@ s .
she 's selling you E@@ ste@@ e L@@ au@@ der foundation .
she , and all of her s@@ ist@@ ers , are selling you pic@@ tures of themselves on their respective pay@@ w@@ alled Ap@@ ps .
she 's selling pic@@ tures of Cin@@ dy C@@ ra@@ w@@ for@@ d 's da@@ ughter she photo@@ grap@@ hed to love magazine .
and , in her down@@ time , pos@@ sibly just as a way still to see s@@ ister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her ki@@ ds , she 's on reality television .
community legal centres turn away 16@@ 0,000 people a year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the nation 's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector br@@ ac@@ ing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already @ - @ st@@ ret@@ ched operations .
in Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly the el@@ derly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight un@@ fair ev@@ ic@@ tions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal ad@@ vice and representation .
community legal services , already st@@ ret@@ ched beyond limits , are br@@ ac@@ ing for further cuts .
from June next year , those legal centres are s@@ lated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
director of Community Leg@@ al C@@ ent@@ res Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ re@@ ll said the latest National Association of Community Leg@@ al C@@ ent@@ res Cen@@ sus Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
M@@ r Far@@ re@@ ll said without a re@@ vers@@ al of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
" Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land 's community legal centres are ch@@ ron@@ ically under@@ funded , mean@@ ing thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , " he said .
people leaving violent relation@@ ships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ ge@@ able and cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing debts , families going through separ@@ ation , workers who are un@@ fair@@ ly sac@@ ked - all of these people have problems with legal di@@ men@@ sions , and this report shows that they 're not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 20@@ 17 , which means thousands more vulnerable Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ lan@@ ders will be forced to nav@@ ig@@ ate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney @ - @ General , and Qu@@ e@@ ens@@ land Sen@@ ator George Bran@@ dis to immediately rever@@ se these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they 're faced with a legal problem .

new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ p 's campaign was su@@ ed for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Car@@ ol@@ ina operations pul@@ led a gun on a st@@ aff@@ er as they dro@@ ve in a Je@@ ep in February .
the incident was described in a law@@ suit filed on Wednesday in state court in Char@@ l@@ ot@@ te by V@@ inc@@ ent Bor@@ dini , a former software tra@@ in@@ er for the state campaign .

after compla@@ ining to local and regional campaign leadership , Bor@@ dini lear@@ ned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phil@@ li@@ p , according to the fil@@ ing .
" gun@@ s don ' t have to fire to inf@@ lic@@ t damage , " Bor@@ dini said in the compla@@ int .
the suit comes just two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential nomin@@ e@@ e caused a fur@@ ore when telling a crowd in North Car@@ ol@@ ina that the " Sec@@ ond A@@ men@@ d@@ ment people " -- under@@ stood to be gun owners and gun en@@ thu@@ si@@ asts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pic@@ k of judges .
tr@@ um@@ p 's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he was@@ n ' t advoc@@ ating violence .
Bor@@ dini 's compla@@ int seeks compensation from the campaign for neg@@ li@@ gent super@@ vision , and from Phil@@ li@@ p for assa@@ ult , bat@@ tery and inf@@ li@@ ction of em@@ o@@ tional dist@@ ress .
tr@@ um@@ p spokeswoman H@@ ope H@@ ic@@ ks didn ' t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach Phil@@ li@@ p were un@@ successful .

G@@ öl@@ ova Distri@@ ct Govern@@ or@@ ship prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages under the district .
in this context , the model village was selected as Can@@ kö@@ y , which is 12 km from the district cen@@ ter and has 66 d@@ wel@@ lings .
village roads , in which infrastructure and super@@ structure services were increased , were as@@ p@@ hal@@ ted and its p@@ av@@ ements were covered with p@@ aving st@@ ones .
the village houses , having many different col@@ or ton@@ es , were pain@@ ted with the support of the business@@ man Se@@ la@@ hat@@ tin A@@ yan who is the owner of Pe@@ lit pas@@ try shops .
all the village took the form of buildings pain@@ ted with wh@@ ite and blu@@ e col@@ ors .
B@@ od@@ rum was taken AS A model

"
while starting this project , we sear@@ ched for a place to take as a model .
when we went to B@@ od@@ rum , the view of the houses pain@@ ted wh@@ ite with blu@@ e win@@ do@@ ws came to our attention .
we wanted to take B@@ od@@ rum as a model because of the wh@@ ite col@@ or 's cle@@ anl@@ iness and its positive effect on the people .
we performed our work and got all the houses in Can@@ kö@@ y pain@@ ted in wh@@ ite and blu@@ e col@@ ors .
this work happened with co@@ operation from the state and a benef@@ actor .
the project cost around 200 thous@@ and li@@ ra .

we@@ alth fund , au@@ dit of which is discussed , is in the committee
expected to ran@@ k among the biggest funds in the world , Turkey 's We@@ alth fund was removed from the ba@@ g bill in a qu@@ iet and re@@ tir@@ ing way upon the objections .
it was decided that the fund would be discussed again because of the lack of an au@@ dit mechanism , but it was discussed in the committee without any amend@@ ment .
evalu@@ ating the bill of law about Turkey 's We@@ alth Fund brought by AKP to so@@ z@@ cu@@ .@@ com@@ .@@ t@@ r , CHP Deputy and Plan@@ ning Bud@@ get Committee member , U@@ t@@ ku Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er , said , " We are certainly against keeping this structure , which will cons@@ ist of public assets , oblig@@ atory reti@@ rement de@@ duc@@ tions from labor@@ ers and workers and the unemployment fund to be collected for the unemployed , out of the Constitutional au@@ dit mechanisms . "
prepared by the government to provide long @ - @ term funds for investments and projects , Turkey 's We@@ alth Fund bill of law was removed on Tuesday from the ba@@ g bill with the opinion of the opposition that it should be discussed separ@@ ately .
however , AKP brought the bill to the Plan@@ ning and Bud@@ get Committee in the same form .
U@@ t@@ ku Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er , CHP member of the T@@ B@@ M@@ M Plan@@ ning and Bud@@ get Commission and Es@@ kiş@@ e@@ hir Deputy , talk@@ ed to so@@ z@@ cu@@ .@@ com@@ .@@ t@@ r about the wor@@ ries and concerns of CHP with regard to the We@@ alth Fund bill of law .
Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er said , " Wh@@ en the establishment of this fund came to the Plan@@ ning and Bud@@ get Committee in the ba@@ g bill , our former Minister of Finance at the head of the CHP delegation , Z@@ ek@@ er@@ iya Tem@@ iz@@ el , expressed our wor@@ ries and concerns and suggested the removal of it from the ba@@ g bill and deta@@ iled discussion of it separ@@ ately . "
the government , accep@@ ting our opinion , with@@ drew the bill .
the bill came to the committee in the same form y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
he said , " The government seems to be ins@@ istent on passing this from the Assembly within a week . "
stat@@ ing that there should be a consensus for passing the We@@ alth Fund law , Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er said , " O@@ ur biggest concern for this bill is irregular@@ ity . "
he explained , " Public assets , oblig@@ atory reti@@ rement de@@ duc@@ tions from labor@@ ers and workers and the in@@ comes to be created from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed , and in@@ comes to be obtained from privati@@ z@@ ation are handed over in an un@@ law@@ ful way to a structure which is outside of the Assembly and Court of Ac@@ count 's au@@ dit and does not have any responsibility . "
stat@@ ing that countries like Russia , China , and G@@ ul@@ f countries , where these kin@@ ds of funds are established , have pet@@ ro@@ leum income and a trade sur@@ plus , and the fund is financed in this way , Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er said , " H@@ ow@@ ever , we have a savings gap . "
for this reason , the fund will cons@@ ist of public sources , in other words , people 's money .
it is planned that money will be transferred to the total of 100 billion to the unemployment fund , 100 billion from the individual reti@@ rement fund that was made oblig@@ atory for employees , and 50 billion from privati@@ z@@ ations .
he said , " I@@ n other words , this fund , to be all created by the money of the people , should certainly be under public audi@@ ting and this money should not be spent ir@@ respon@@ sibly . "
stressing that it is unacceptable that a fund , in which public sources are collected and public assets are supp@@ lied as col@@ la@@ ter@@ al in inc@@ ur@@ ring debt , is outside of the Assembly 's au@@ dit , Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er talk@@ ed about his wor@@ ries and concerns with regard to the We@@ alth Fund bill of law as follows :
works and procedures for the collec@@ ting and spending of such a big public as@@ set and providing it as col@@ la@@ ter@@ al can not be g@@ los@@ sed over with audi@@ ts only from independent audi@@ ting firms .
there should certainly be public audi@@ ting and a transparent structure .
in the bill of law , there is no pro@@ vision for the We@@ alth Fund 's au@@ dit by the institutions and transparency .
a re@@ stri@@ ction was not placed on how many resources will be transferred .
no one will be able to call to account how the fund is used .
financing of big projects is shown as a reason for the aim of the fund .
therefore , there is no need to establish an un@@ chec@@ ked fund outside of the budget .
why don ' t you include it in the budget ?
therefore the question , " Wh@@ y does it es@@ cape from an au@@ dit by the Court of Ac@@ counts and Assembly ? , " n@@ atur@@ ally comes to mind .
stat@@ ing that they are not against the transfer of the money collected in the We@@ alth Fund to investments , but they are against the fact that it is done with a n@@ on@@ transparent mechanism that does not give an account , Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er continued as follows : " it can be discussed whether there is a need for such a fund . "
however , if the government is ins@@ istent on this , then we have to ensure that the international standards , which are val@@ id in the countries where these kin@@ ds of investment funds are established , will be val@@ id also in Turkey .
it should certainly be struc@@ tured in a way that an audi@@ ting and responsibility mechanism is brought .
it should be established in a way that there won ' t be any ble@@ mis@@ h , and it will give an account to the citizens for their own money down to the last kur@@ us .
under@@ lining that they are certainly against the We@@ alth Fund bill of law in the form that it came to the committee , Ç@@ ak@@ ır@@ öz@@ er said , " We are g@@ la@@ d that AKP l@@ ist@@ ens to our critic@@ isms in the Assembly , especially after the July 15 coup attempt . "
we hope that AKP will lis@@ ten to our constructive critic@@ isms also in this bill of law .
we are against un@@ law@@ ful use , transfer of the national assets , and ir@@ responsibility of those who use them and the lack of public audi@@ ting .
he said , " The desi@@ red We@@ alth Fund may be benef@@ ic@@ ial only if these concerns are elimin@@ ated . "
it was reported that work has been done to ensure a consensus between AKP and the opposition on the coming bill of law .
" the investments we made are a sign of the trust we place in Turkey "
talking at a meeting in İstanbul , Chairman of the Executive Board in For@@ d Ot@@ omo@@ tiv , Ali Ko@@ ç , said , " the 30 billion T@@ L investment we made in the last 5 years is a sign of the trust we put in the future of our country . "
the Vice Chairman of the Executive Board in Ko@@ ç Holding and the Chairman of the Executive Board in For@@ d Ot@@ omo@@ tiv , Ali Ko@@ ç , and a large number of man@@ agers in foreign capital companies came together in the meeting under the th@@ eme " Th@@ ose who trust in Turkey , those who produce in Turkey , " which was organiz@@ ed by the İstanbul Chamber O@@ f Industry ( IS@@ O ) .
speaking at the meeting , Ali Ko@@ ç said , " We , together with our partners , express our beli@@ ef and trust in our country not only in an or@@ al way but we also offer our support through our investments and actions . "
the 30 billion T@@ L investment we made in the last 5 years is a sign of the trust we put in the future of our country .
the in@@ dis@@ pen@@ sa@@ ble aspects of Turkey to attract more foreign investment are a reli@@ able and fair law system , a democracy of international standards , a s@@ killed work@@ force and R & D , innov@@ ation , entrepren@@ eur@@ ship and an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem which encour@@ ages added value .
our government offered the most comprehensive incen@@ tives of our Republic 's history to our industri@@ alists in recent years .
he added , " I believe that we will be able to start the new ' Investment Action ' that we need with these incen@@ tives and integrated strate@@ gies . "
chairman of the Board and CEO in Si@@ em@@ ens Industry and Trade Turkey , H@@ ü@@ sey@@ in Ge@@ lis , said , " N@@ o issue is the problem of just one country any@@ more , we know this as global players . "
we came to Turkey with a long term view .
our problems will be solved as long as we are in unity and solidarity .
we were able to bring something that could not happen in Turkey in the last 160 years .
we will continue to be present in these areas in Turkey .
he said , " We will certainly establish fac@@ tories but our hor@@ iz@@ on should be open in this area . "
stat@@ ing that Turkey is one of 10 countries as a priority for them , S@@ hel@@ l Turkey President , Ahmet Er@@ dem , said , " Turkey is one of 10 countries that are a priority for S@@ hel@@ l . "
we believe in the potential and future of Turkey .
we made investments in many areas especially in energy , and we are continuing to do so .
we than@@ k our President , Prime Minister and Ministers for their work that supports international investors .
re@@ ass@@ uring work is done for international investors .
he said , " T@@ his is in the direction of increasing the competitive power of our country . "
San@@ do@@ z / Nov@@ arti@@ s Turkey and Middle East Regi@@ on Director Dr. Al@@ tan Dem@@ ir@@ d@@ ere , " O@@ ur Global CEO was about to come to Turkey on August 10 . "
however , the trip was postponed .
we opposed this .
because the CEO 's arri@@ val was very important .
they made some requests such as a bul@@ let@@ proof car and gu@@ ards .
then , when he came here , he saw that everything is normal .
he left the gu@@ ards and car , and returned to his country happ@@ ily .
investment in a country is like a mar@@ ri@@ age .
fir@@ st@@ ly , a promise is made , then the engagement is done if everything goes s@@ mo@@ o@@ thly and you get mar@@ ried by making a long term plan .
we are mar@@ ried to Turkey and we do not have any intention to get di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
we returned from the br@@ ink of the ab@@ y@@ s@@ s !
the Prime Minister , Bin@@ ali Yıl@@ dır@@ ım , addressed the businessmen by participating by tele@@ conference in the consul@@ tation meeting with the th@@ eme " Th@@ ose who trust in Turkey , those who produce in Turkey , " which was organiz@@ ed in the Swiss Ho@@ tel by the İstanbul Chamber of Commerce .
stat@@ ing that the industrial sector is the sector that will ensure Turkey 's compar@@ ative advantage , Prime Minister Yıl@@ dır@@ ım said , " I@@ n the industrial sector , we should avoid missing the process of transition into ' Industry 4.@@ 0 . ' "
he said , " I@@ f we give importance to becoming high in added value and a lo@@ com@@ o@@ tive for our country and reach the 20@@ 23 targets , we need to think about the industrial revol@@ ution in the infor@@ ma@@ tics and technology revol@@ ution , and achieve it . "
adding that Turkey returned from the br@@ ink of an ab@@ y@@ s@@ s on the night of July 15 , Prime Minister Yıl@@ dır@@ ım said , " I@@ f those who intended to k@@ ill the future of our country , those who tried to dem@@ ol@@ ish its democracy , the ras@@ c@@ als who did not stop from bomb@@ ing our Vet@@ er@@ an Assembly , had been successful , we would be talking about a different Turkey today . "
we would be talking about a Turkey , whose management was taken by the coup , whose national will was removed and which dropped from the world of developing countries le@@ ague into the 3rd world countries .
he said , " T@@ han@@ ks to G@@ od , we exp@@ elled this cal@@ am@@ ity with our nation 's determination , our Chief Commander and es@@ te@@ e@@ med President , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan 's sa@@ g@@ ac@@ ity , and our Government 's determination . "
Prime Minister Yıl@@ dır@@ ım continued as follows : " we will immediately get over the impact of this incident and look ahead . "
it is never , ever proper that we live with cou@@ ps .
we have many as@@ ser@@ tive targets ahead .
this coup attempt did not shak@@ e the Turkish economy .
those who expected cha@@ os and crisis were mist@@ ak@@ en again .
today both our democracy and economy are sound and on their fe@@ et .
our banking sector , finance sector are continuing to work in a health@@ y way .
it seems that the foreign trade deficit decre@@ ased by 25 per@@ cent in 2015 .
while the rati@@ o of current deficit to national income was 5.@@ 8 per@@ cent in 2014 , this rati@@ o fell to 4.5 in 2015 .
we are a@@ iming to drop it to 4 by the end of the year .
we will never change our ti@@ ght stance on public finance .
Turkey 's 20@@ 16 budget is higher than the national income of 130 countries .
we decre@@ ased the rati@@ o of the budget deficit to national income , which was over 11 per@@ cent , to the level of 1.@@ 3 per@@ cent in 2015 and we are strugg@@ ling to maintain these rati@@ os .
with regard to public debt , we are in a better situation than the EU and many countries in the world .
our banking and finance sectors are continuing their work on a stable base .
he added , " O@@ ur Central Bank did not need to ad@@ d foreign currency to the market in sp@@ ite of July 15 and a decrease in our reserves is out of the question , we have a gr@@ os@@ s reser@@ ve of over 1@@ 21 billion dol@@ lar@@ s . "
expla@@ ining that they will provide all kin@@ ds of conven@@ i@@ ences for the development of the economy , increasing production and creating new employment areas , Prime Minister Yıl@@ dır@@ ım said , " I@@ n addition , we are issu@@ ing comprehensive regulations to get rid of your re@@ tr@@ os@@ pec@@ tive debts . "
we real@@ ized many regulations from the re@@ mission of stock to the instal@@ l@@ ment of cash sur@@ plus and un@@ paid tax debts by again intro@@ ducing new conven@@ i@@ ences , and we are continuing to real@@ ize .
he said , " A@@ s long as you continue to produce for the country and trust in your country , your government will continue to remove the obstacles for you one by one . "

Turkey will not break lo@@ ose from the West , will not give up on the European Union
Mehmet Şimşek : Turkey will not break lo@@ ose from the West , will not give up on the European Union
the Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek , the Minister of Science , Industry and Technology , Far@@ uk Öz@@ lü , and the Minister of Economy , N@@ ih@@ at Z@@ ey@@ bek@@ çi , participated in the meeting with the th@@ eme " Th@@ ose who trust in Turkey , those who produce in Turkey , " which is organiz@@ ed by the İstanbul Chamber of Commerce ( IS@@ O ) .
speaking in the meeting , the Minister of Science , Industry and Economy , Far@@ uk Öz@@ lü , said , " I think many fav@@ or@@ able results emerged on the night of July 15 and from the developments experienced after@@ wards . "
the most important one is certainly the spirit of unity and solidarity which the whole of Turkey is now feel@@ ing deep@@ ly .
the July 15 process showed the strong dynam@@ ics the Turkish economy has and to what level society has adopted democracy .
he said , " I@@ t is clear that the following process will be easier and more rapid for a society that has reached this level of economy and democracy . "
" Turkey needs T@@ O get rid of this dist@@ ress "
going up to the ros@@ tru@@ m after Far@@ uk Öz@@ lü and saying that they have difficul@@ ty in expla@@ ining the July 15 coup attempt to the world , the Minister of Economy , N@@ ih@@ at Z@@ ey@@ bek@@ çi , stated that they declared Mo@@ bil@@ iz@@ ation in this matter as a government .
Z@@ ey@@ bek@@ çi mentioned the reduction of interest initiated by the banks , and said , " I@@ f 6@@ 3.@@ 4 % of the profit of my real sector 's first five hun@@ d@@ red goes to interest , we should drop everything and focus on this matter . "
for this reason , as a matter of fact , our President talks about this matter repeatedly .
Turkey needs to get rid of this dist@@ ress with the unity and solidarity that politics has shown after the July 15 civil Turkish democracy revol@@ ution with its real sector , banking system , government , and politics .
we welcome the recent developments here .
he said , " We hope that we as the management of the economy , will support this competition by the banks down to 0.@@ 9 and 0.@@ 8 per month , which started with our President 's incen@@ tive , and real@@ ize its sustain@@ ability , continu@@ ity . "
" we W@@ I@@ L@@ L put the green pass@@ port under our expor@@ ter '@@ S order "
saying , " I@@ n the following period we will go the long way around the world , " N@@ ih@@ at Z@@ ey@@ bek@@ çi stated , " We won ' t leave a single country un@@ visited and we won ' t leave any stone un@@ turned under the leadership of our President , Prime Minister . "
there is nobody we won ' t contact to increase our trade .
he explained , " We will never , ever b@@ link ; we won ' t lose the bir@@ ds in our hands while going after the bird on the branch . "
Z@@ ey@@ bek@@ çi stated that a green pass@@ port will be given to expor@@ ters later on as well , and added , " A law for one of the recent decisions was issued , and we finished its regulation in the ministry of economy ; we will put the privile@@ ged green pass@@ port which represents our country under the order of our expor@@ ters with around 17 or 20 thous@@ and expor@@ ters among the expor@@ ters in the first round . "
" those W@@ H@@ O committed the coup attempt should B@@ E clear@@ ed from the state "
men@@ tioning the July 15 coup attempt and the state of emergency declared after@@ wards , the Deputy Prime Minister , Mehmet Şimşek , described the coup attempt as a ' ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are ' and said , " H@@ ow@@ ever , it is now behind us , we should look ahead from now on . "
stat@@ ing that the state of emergency was declared because of two reasons , Şimşek said , " su@@ rely those who were starting an in@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion and those who committed the coup attempt should be clear@@ ed from the state and this process is advan@@ cing ; however , the more important thing is that serious administrative reform is needed in order not to face these kin@@ ds of coup attempts . "
therefore the State of E@@ mer@@ gency was declared as an atmosphere needed for these administrative reforms and many serious structural reforms have been done up until now .
he said , " su@@ rely we acted and we will act within the democratic principles and state of law while doing all this . "
expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas , Şimşek stressed that there is no reason to worry for the companies and individuals that have not been involved in the financing of terrorism .
men@@ tioning that Turkey 's democracy got stronger , Şimşek said , " I@@ n my opinion , the foun@@ dations of Turkey 's democracy got stronger ; because when you look at the ro@@ ot of the problems in the recent past , you will certainly see that this gang of bet@@ r@@ ay@@ ers had a hand in the matter . "
he said , " T@@ her@@ e@@ fore , the cle@@ aring of this terrorist organiz@@ ation from the state , and the closing of this period in Turkey will strengthen Turkey 's democracy . "
expla@@ ining that economic foun@@ dations are strong and they returned to their structural reform agenda without losing any time , Şimşek said , " Turkey returned to its main agenda , there are advan@@ ces in the structural reforms . "
as a matter of fact , structural reforms are our sine qu@@ a non because pop@@ ul@@ ism and protec@@ tion@@ ism are rising around the world .
he said , " Turkey can be prepared for the future only by making reforms . "
finally stressing that Turkey will not break lo@@ ose from the West , Şimşek said , " Turkey may have a clas@@ h of ideas with our western allies , friends from time to time but Turkey will not break lo@@ ose from the West , it will not give up on the European Union . "

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will also deliver re@@ generation and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attr@@ action of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was with London 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the Games .
the Olympics achieved huge benefits for Str@@ at@@ for@@ d and the East En@@ d .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities alone we 'll create 10,000 new ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ces@@ hi@@ ps , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of London 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row expansion is too great .
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embar@@ r@@ ass@@ ed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row is ans@@ w@@ ering every question asked of it .
like the Olympics , He@@ ath@@ row is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11@@ b@@ n in economic growth , leaving a leg@@ acy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ ath@@ row who have implemented an £ 11@@ b@@ n programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from T@@ 5 - voted the world 's best airport ter@@ minal five years in a row , to T@@ 2 , built in the middle of the world 's bu@@ si@@ est two run@@ ways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third run@@ way , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row , sec@@ uring our tra@@ ding future and creating a leg@@ acy of skills and employment that Britain can be pro@@ ud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in " c@@ at @ - @ and @ - @ mo@@ use game " over ad blocking
for companies that make money from online adverti@@ sing , attempts to circum@@ v@@ ent ad @ - @ blocking software amount to a " c@@ at @ - @ and @ - @ mo@@ use game , " according to one of the companies that makes that software .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad bloc@@ kers on its des@@ k@@ top site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g post saying that users could up@@ date their fil@@ ters in its program to block ad@@ s on the social network once again .
on Tuesday , Facebook said that its des@@ k@@ top website would change the co@@ ding around its ad@@ s in order to make it more difficult for ad bloc@@ kers to de@@ tec@@ t which parts of a page are ad@@ s .
but Ad@@ block now says it has g@@ ot@@ ten around the new co@@ des .
in a blo@@ g post , Ad@@ block spokesperson B@@ en Wil@@ liam@@ s wrote that " this sor@@ t of back @ - @ and @ - @ for@@ th battle between the open source ad @ - @ blocking community and circum@@ ven@@ ters has been going on since ad blocking was in@@ ven@@ ted , " and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fi@@ x soon .
the fact that the world 's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indic@@ ation of just how big a concern ad bloc@@ kers have become for the industry .
g@@ lob@@ ally , roug@@ h@@ ly 200 million people use ad bloc@@ kers , according to a study last year from Pa@@ ge@@ fair and ad@@ o@@ be ; nearly qu@@ ad@@ rup@@ le the number who used such software in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users ac@@ ces@@ sing Facebook via mobile dev@@ ices , mobile adverti@@ sing now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook 's adverti@@ sing revenue .
the company is going after ad bloc@@ kers on des@@ k@@ top however , because mobile ad bloc@@ kers are not effective in Facebook 's mobile Ap@@ ps for the social network and In@@ st@@ ag@@ ram , a spokesperson said .
des@@ k@@ top ad@@ s still account for enough revenue that Facebook ju@@ dged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on Tuesday , Facebook said it would be up@@ dating its " ad pre@@ fer@@ ences " to@@ ol to give people more control over how ad@@ s are targeted to them .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block 's new fil@@ ters were concerning because they would also block some non @ - @ adverti@@ sing content on the site .
" this is@@ n ' t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , " a Facebook spokesperson said in an e @ - @ ma@@ iled statement .
AD bloc@@ kers are a b@@ l@@ un@@ t instr@@ ument , which is why we 've instead focused on building to@@ ols like A@@ d pre@@ fer@@ ences to put control in people 's hands .
woman run over on Swiss motor@@ way in appar@@ ent suic@@ ide
the vic@@ tim was lying on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night .
police are appe@@ aling for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motor@@ way in the early hours of Thursday in an appar@@ ent act of suic@@ ide .
the incident happened on the A1 near Mor@@ ges in the can@@ ton of V@@ au@@ d just after mid@@ night on Thursday .
a woman lay down in the dar@@ k on the road " in a desp@@ er@@ ate act " and was hit by several vehicles , V@@ au@@ d police said in a statement .
clearly looking to k@@ ill her@@ self , the vic@@ tim , a Swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lor@@ ry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been inter@@ viewed but some are still uni@@ denti@@ fied , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who wit@@ nes@@ sed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a " log@@ ical " step in a situation like this , lawyer G@@ il@@ les H@@ of@@ ste@@ t@@ ter told L@@ e Tribune de Gen@@ eve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that 's what the prosecutor must determine , " said H@@ of@@ ste@@ t@@ ter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person w@@ alk@@ ing on the motor@@ way in the dar@@ k - it was ju@@ dged that motor@@ ists can not expect to come across a pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an on the motor@@ way in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acquit@@ ted of ca@@ using death by neg@@ ligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near P@@ ay@@ ner@@ ne one night in August 2014 .
the 22 @ - @ year @ - @ old vic@@ tim had been dr@@ in@@ king and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who was respon@@ ding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justi@@ fied and that the presence of a man on the road was a " completely excep@@ tional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , " the judge said .
anyone with information about Thursday 's incident near Mor@@ ges should call police on 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate model : Ven@@ us was once habi@@ table
Ven@@ us was likely once habi@@ table , according to the proj@@ ec@@ tions of a new NA@@ SA climate model .
scientists at NA@@ SA 's G@@ od@@ dar@@ d Institute for Sp@@ ace Studies developed a model to expl@@ ore Ven@@ us ' past using to@@ ols and al@@ gor@@ ith@@ ms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not Ven@@ us , with its ho@@ t , water @ - @ less sur@@ face and C@@ O@@ 2 @ - @ ch@@ oc@@ ked atmosphere , might have once hosted E@@ ar@@ th @ - @ like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that Ven@@ us ' slow ro@@ tation rate is explained by its th@@ ic@@ k atmosphere .
but the latest si@@ mu@@ lation suggests Ven@@ us could have bo@@ as@@ ted a th@@ in , E@@ ar@@ th @ - @ like atmosphere and still sp@@ un slow@@ ly .
the model also lo@@ oked at the top@@ o@@ graphy of early Ven@@ us .
the plan@@ et likely featured more d@@ ry regions than E@@ ar@@ th , but once had enough water and geo@@ graph@@ ical vari@@ ability to host life and guard against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
early Ven@@ us also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 per@@ cent di@@ m@@ mer .
" in the G@@ IS@@ S model 's si@@ mu@@ lation , Ven@@ us ' slow sp@@ in ex@@ poses its day@@ side to the sun for almost two months at a time , " G@@ IS@@ S scienti@@ st An@@ th@@ ony D@@ el Gen@@ io explained in a news release .
this war@@ ms the sur@@ face and pro@@ du@@ ces rain that cre@@ ates a th@@ ic@@ k lay@@ er of cl@@ ou@@ ds , which acts like an um@@ bre@@ l@@ la to shi@@ eld the sur@@ face from much of the so@@ lar he@@ ating .
the result is mean climate temper@@ atures that are actually a few de@@ gre@@ es co@@ o@@ ler than E@@ ar@@ th 's today .
the model produced a story of Ven@@ us similar to the ev@@ olution previously hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ ized by plan@@ etary scientists .
though likely once habi@@ table , Ven@@ us was -- over the course of several billion years -- ex@@ posed to too much he@@ at and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light .
its O@@ ce@@ ans ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and its water v@@ ap@@ or was bur@@ ned away by ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let light .
as its hydro@@ gen es@@ cap@@ ed , all that was left was a th@@ ic@@ k atmosphere of car@@ bon di@@ o@@ x@@ ide with a de@@ ath@@ ly gre@@ en@@ house gas effect -- thus , the Ven@@ us we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new Ven@@ us climate model in the journ@@ al Ge@@ op@@ hy@@ sical Research Let@@ ters .
Patri@@ ck Ro@@ y resign@@ s as av@@ alan@@ che coach
Patri@@ ck Ro@@ y resigned as coach and vice president of the ho@@ c@@ key operations of the Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o av@@ alan@@ che on Thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team 's decision @ - @ making process .
Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o executive vice president / general manager Jo@@ e S@@ ak@@ ic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
" for the past three years , I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of ho@@ c@@ key operations for the Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o av@@ alan@@ che with energy , pas@@ sion and determination , " the 50 @ - @ year @ - @ old Ro@@ y said in the statement .
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the dep@@ th it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and V@@ P @ - @ ho@@ c@@ key operations needs to be per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly al@@ ig@@ ned with that of the organiz@@ ation .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team 's performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
S@@ ak@@ ic , who hi@@ red Ro@@ y on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked Ro@@ y for his contributions to the team .
" Patri@@ ck informed me of his decision today , " S@@ ak@@ ic said .
we appreci@@ ate all he has done for our organiz@@ ation and wish him the best of lu@@ ck in the future .
Ro@@ y was named the J@@ ack A@@ da@@ ms Award winner as the le@@ ague 's best coach during his ro@@ ok@@ ie season with the av@@ alan@@ che in 2013 @ - @ 14 .
he gu@@ i@@ ded the club to 1@@ 12 points and a first @ - @ place finish in the Central Di@@ vision , but Col@@ or@@ ad@@ o was up@@ set by Min@@ nes@@ ot@@ a in the first round of the play@@ off@@ s and has mis@@ sed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .

north Sea oil workers resume talks , suspen@@ d strike
la@@ b@@ or strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negoti@@ ators said .
strikes against o@@ il@@ field services company Wo@@ od Group have been staged spor@@ adi@@ cally on plat@@ forms in the North Sea oper@@ ated by R@@ oy@@ al Dutch S@@ hel@@ l .
" wood Group and the un@@ ite and R@@ M@@ T unions can confir@@ m we have agreed to re@@ start the process for resolution of the current dispute , " a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full @ - @ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the la@@ b@@ or unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 per@@ cent .
wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contr@@ actors by about 9 per@@ cent because of negative market pres@@ sures .
the company 's rate reduction follows a 10 per@@ cent decrease for on@@ sh@@ ore contr@@ actors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market down@@ turn .
S@@ hel@@ l , for its part , has tri@@ m@@ med thousands of people from its p@@ ayr@@ ol@@ l and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stre@@ am@@ lines its operations in the wake of its me@@ ga @ - @ mer@@ ger with British energy company B@@ G Group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower cru@@ de oil prices , an economic situation comp@@ oun@@ ded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
Scot@@ tish M@@ ember of Parliament D@@ ave An@@ der@@ son met with la@@ b@@ or leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest la@@ b@@ or disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation .
the North Sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
" in the North Sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , " he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.@@ 4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 20@@ 16 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .

" we hope that by compar@@ ing our results to other star clu@@ st@@ ers , we will learn more about the relationship between a star 's mass , its age , and even the history of its so@@ lar system , " Lu@@ isa Re@@ bul@@ l , a research scienti@@ st at Cal@@ te@@ ch 's inf@@ rar@@ ed Pro@@ ces@@ sing and An@@ al@@ y@@ sis C@@ enter in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , said in a news release .
the P@@ le@@ iade@@ s cl@@ us@@ ter is situ@@ ated 4@@ 45 light @ - @ years from E@@ ar@@ th .
many of the st@@ ars in the cl@@ us@@ ter are just now reaching ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od , having been born roug@@ h@@ ly 1@@ 25 million years ago .
they 're sp@@ in@@ ning as fast as they ever will .
at their pe@@ ak sp@@ in rates , these ma@@ turing st@@ ars e@@ ject large amounts of ste@@ l@@ lar wind .
as these win@@ ds travel across the st@@ ars ' ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic fields , they en@@ act a br@@ ak@@ ing effect on the st@@ ars .
as a star ages , its sp@@ in rate begins to slow down .
K@@ ep@@ ler measures each star 's sp@@ in rate by trac@@ king the time between the appearance of reco@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ able star@@ sp@@ ots -- like sun@@ sp@@ ots .
the latest cat@@ alo@@ g of sp@@ in rates suggests more massive st@@ ars sp@@ in more slow@@ ly than less massive st@@ ars .
Re@@ bul@@ l lik@@ ens the st@@ ars to dan@@ c@@ ers , larger ones pi@@ ro@@ u@@ et@@ ting more slow@@ ly than smaller ones .
" in the ' bal@@ let ' of the P@@ le@@ iade@@ s , we see that slow rot@@ ators ten@@ d to be more massive , where@@ as the fas@@ test rot@@ ators ten@@ d to be very light st@@ ars , " said Re@@ bul@@ l .
because the P@@ le@@ iade@@ s cl@@ us@@ ter is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ m@@ ic labor@@ atory to compar@@ e ste@@ l@@ lar qu@@ alities with sp@@ in rates .
" the P@@ le@@ iade@@ s star cl@@ us@@ ter provides an an@@ ch@@ or for the@@ o@@ re@@ tical mode@@ ls of ste@@ l@@ lar ro@@ tation going both direc@@ tions , youn@@ ger and ol@@ der , " said Re@@ bul@@ l .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why st@@ ars slow their sp@@ in rates and han@@ g up their ' dance sho@@ es , ' so to speak .
Re@@ bul@@ l and her colleagues deta@@ iled their latest analysis of P@@ le@@ iade@@ s sp@@ in rates in three new p@@ apers , soon to be published in the A@@ str@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
